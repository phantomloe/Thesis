T1w images were preprocessed using the minc-bpipe- library (https://github.com/CoBrALab/minc- bpipe- library), including bias field correction (Tustison et al., 2010), adaptive non-local means denoising (Manjón et al., 2010), head masking and brain extraction (Eskildsen et al., 2012) The resulting bias field corrected, head-masked images and brain masks of each subject were input into the CIVET algo- rithm (Ad-Dab’bagh et al., 2006; Lerch & Evans, 2005) (version 2.1.0) in order to obtain cortical mid-surfaces and vertex wise measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), describing CT and SA esti- mates at a total of 81924 points across the cortical mid-surface."""
