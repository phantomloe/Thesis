model in Moran et al. (2015) speciﬁes  that post-decisional  evidence  ac- 
cumulation  is an important  determinant  of conﬁdence  judgments.  
Because  each account  diﬀers with respect to the timing of 
conﬁdence-related  computations  relative  to the ﬁrst-order  decision,  
electrophysiological  measures  with high temporal  resolution,  such as 
electroencephalography  (EEG), have been used to identify  neural cor- 
relates of decision  conﬁdence.  This work has provided  some support  
for both decisional  and post-decisional  locus models,  however  there are 
important  methodological  issues that limit the inferences  we can draw 
from these studies.  
1.1. Support  for decisional  locus models 
In line with predictions  of decisional  locus models,  previous  work has 
revealed  that subjective  and model-derived  conﬁdence  ratings monoton-  
ically scale with the amplitude  of the centro-parietal  positivity  (CPP) 
event-related  potential  (ERP) component  ( O’Connell  et al., 2012 ) from 
around 300 ms after target stimulus  onset ( Squires  et al., 1973 ; Gherman  
& Philiastides,  2015 , 2018 ; Herding  et al., 2019 ; Zarkewski  et al., 
2019 ; Rausch  et al., 2020 ) or immediately  preceding  a keypress  re- 
sponse used to report a decision  ( Philiastides  et al., 2014 ). The CPP 
is thought  to be analogous  to the parietal  P3 component  in perceptual  
decision  tasks ( Twomey  et al., 2015 ) and typically  increases  in ampli- 
tude to a ﬁxed threshold  around the time of a decision  ( O’Connell  et al., 
2012 ; Kelly & O’Connell,  2013 ; Twomey  et al., 2015 ), closely resem- 
bling the accumulation-to-bound  trajectories  of decision  variables  in 
evidence  accumulation  models ( Ratcliﬀ,  1978 ; Ratcliﬀ et  al., 2016 ; 
Twomey  et al., 2015 ; Kelly et al., 2021 ). These ﬁndings  have been inter- 
preted as reﬂecting  higher levels of decision  evidence  accumulation  in 
favour of the chosen option in trials with higher conﬁdence  ratings (e.g., 
Philiastides  et al., 2014 ; Gherman  & Philiastides,  2018 ). Consequently,  
this has been taken as support  for the ‘balance  of evidence  hypothesis’  
described  in some decisional-locus  models of conﬁdence,  which speciﬁes  
that conﬁdence  indexes  diﬀerences  in the positions  of racing accumu-  
lators in discrete  choice tasks ( Vickers,  1979 ; Vickers  & Packer,  1982 ; 
Kiani & Shadlen,  2009 ). Here, we make the assumption  that the CPP 
is time-locked  to the response,  in line with the original  deﬁnition  of 
this component  ( O’Connell  et al., 2012 ). However,  we note that in some 
studies the CPP and P3 are also considered  to be stimulus-locked  (e.g., 
Rausch  et al., 2020 ). 
The abovementioned  studies have measured  CPP/P3  amplitudes  
within a ﬁxed time window  relative  to stimulus  onset, except for 
Philiastides  et al. (2014) which analysed  model-derived  (rather than 
self-reported)  conﬁdence  ratings.  Importantly,  the CPP has been found 
to be tightly time-locked  to the time of the keypress  used to report a 
decision  (e.g., O’Connell  et al., 2012 ; van Vugt et al., 2019 ). Higher con- 
ﬁdence  ratings are typically  given in trials with faster choice response  
times (RTs; e.g., Johnson,  1939 ; Vickers  & Packer,  1982 ; Kiani et al., 
2014 ), at least for a sizeable  majority  of individuals  (for an analysis  
of 4,089 participants  see Rahnev  et al., 2020 ). In addition,  participant-  
level RT distributions  are strongly  right-skewed,  meaning  that there is 
a larger amount  of timing variability  for relatively  slower RTs. For ex- 
ample, there is typically  a much larger range of RTs between  the 70th 
and 90th percentiles  of an RT distribution  as compared  to the range 
between  the 10th and 30th percentiles.  This means that, in many per- 
ceptual  decision  tasks, the CPP typically  peaks within commonly-used  
stimulus-locked  CPP/P3  amplitude  measurement  windows  (e.g., 350- 
500 ms in Rausch  et al., 2020 ) in trials with faster RTs and higher con- 
ﬁdence  ratings (see Fig. 1 of Kelly & O’Connell,  2013 ). In trials with 
slower RTs (and lower conﬁdence  ratings)  the CPP is likely to peak 
later than these typical stimulus-locked  measurement  windows  and will 
also show higher amounts  of timing variability  (i.e., temporal  smearing,  
see Ouyang  et al., 2015 ), producing  apparently  smaller  stimulus-locked  
CPP amplitude  measures  in those trials. This, in turn, can artiﬁcially  
produce  diﬀerences  in stimulus-locked  CPP amplitude  measures  across 
higher/lower  conﬁdence  ratings in cases where there are no real dif- ferences  during the pre-response  time window  in response-locked  ERPs 
(e.g., O’Connell  et al., 2012 ; Kelly & O’Connell,  2013 ). Consequently,  
based on our assumption  that the CPP is a response-locked  component,  
we believe  it is important  to measure  CPP amplitudes  using response-  
locked ERPs in addition  to stimulus-locked  measures,  to ensure that ef- 
fects on stimulus-locked  ERPs are not simply by-products  of RT diﬀer- 
ences across conﬁdence  rating conditions.  
The ﬁndings  of a recent study ( Kelly & O’Connell,  2013 ) also raise 
questions  about whether  these previously  reported  eﬀects at centro- 
parietal  electrodes  actually  reﬂect amplitude  modulations  of the CPP 
component.  Kelly and O’Connell  (2013) observed  larger pre-response  
CPP amplitudes  in conditions  of higher stimulus  discriminability  (which 
often closely correlates  with conﬁdence).  However,  this eﬀect was not 
observed  after applying  a current  source density  (CSD) transformation  
( Kayser & Tenke, 2006 ), which better isolates  distinct  cortical  sources  of 
EEG signals that are often conﬂated  in analyses  of standard  ERPs. Kelly 
and O’Connell  also identiﬁed  a fronto-central  component  which ex- 
hibited more positive-going  amplitudes  in higher discriminability  con- 
ditions,  which appeared  to bias CPP measurements  at centro-parietal  
channels  via volume  conduction.  CSD-transformations  were not used in 
the primary  data analyses  of the other studies listed above, and so it 
remains  to be veriﬁed  if these ﬁndings  reﬂect genuine  modulations  of 
the CPP, or contributions  from other temporally-overlapping  sources.  
1.2. Support  for post-decisional  locus models 
Studies  supporting  post-decisional  locus models have described  neg- 
ative correlations  between  the amplitude  of the error positivity  (Pe) 
component  ( Falkenstein  et al., 1991 ) and decision  conﬁdence  ratings 
( Boldt & Yeung, 2015 ; Desender  et al., 2019b ). The Pe component  oc- 
curs around 200-400  ms after the participant  has formed  a ﬁrst-order  
decision  and is measured  at the same centro-parietal  electrodes  as the 
CPP component.  A negative  association  between  Pe amplitudes  and con- 
ﬁdence  was ﬁrst described  by Boldt and Yeung (2015) , who reported  
that Pe amplitudes  were larger (i.e. more positive-going)  when partic- 
ipants gave conﬁdence  ratings indicating  that they had made an error, 
and also when they were less conﬁdent  that they had made a correct 
decision.  More speciﬁcally,  they identiﬁed  a monotonic  relationship  be- 
tween conﬁdence  and Pe amplitudes  across the conﬁdence  spectrum  
ranging  from ‘certainly  wrong’ to ‘unsure’  to ‘certainly  correct’.  The Pe 
component  was proposed  to be a neural correlate  of post-decisional  ev- 
idence accumulation  that is speciﬁcally  framed in terms of detecting  a 
response  error, which in turn informs  decision  conﬁdence  judgements  
( Desender  et al., 2021b ; see also Murphy  et al., 2015 ). Congruent  with 
this notion, the Pe is also more positive-going  when participants  de- 
tect that they had committed  a response  error (e.g., Ridderinkhof  et al., 
2009 ; Steinhauser  & Yeung, 2010 ; Wessel et al., 2011 ; Murphy  et al., 
2015 ). 
Although  Boldt and Yeung (2015) developed  an innovative  frame- 
work that attempted  to unify conﬁdence  and error detection,  there are 
also methodological  issues that should be considered  when interpret-  
ing their ﬁndings.  Most importantly,  for their key analyses  they mea- 
sured response-locked  ERPs and used a pre-response  baseline.  This pre- 
response  baseline  largely overlapped  with a time window  over which 
CPP/P3  amplitudes  varied across conﬁdence  ratings,  and the CPP and 
Pe were measured  over similar sets of centro-parietal  electrodes  (their 
Fig. 3 B, see also Philiastides  et al., 2014 ; Gherman  & Philiastides,  2015 , 
2018 ). In such cases, any systematic  diﬀerences  across conditions  dur- 
ing the pre-response  baseline  period will lead to spurious  diﬀerences  in 
post-response  ERPs ( Luck, 2014 ). In the case of Boldt and Yeung (2015) , 
their baseline  subtraction  procedure  would have artiﬁcially  inﬂated  Pe 
amplitudes  in trials with lower pre-response  CPP amplitudes,  such as 
trials with lower conﬁdence  ratings or response  errors (e.g., von Lautz 
et al., 2019 ). This issue also applies to a subsequent  study that replicated  
this eﬀect ( Desender  et al., 2019b ). Therefore,  it remains  to be veriﬁed  
whether  Pe amplitudes  do monotonically  scale with decision  conﬁdence

and right-tilted  gratings  were presented.  Red and blue lines respectively  depict the contrast  levels of the dominant  (i.e. higher contrast)  and non-dominant  (lower 
contrast)  gratings  within the target stimulus  (inner circle) in each phase of the trial. Participants  indicated  which set of stripes in the S1 target stimulus  was dominant  
(i.e. of higher contrast).  In 50% of trials the S1 target was followed  by a second S2 target that appeared  within 50 ms of the response  to the S1 target. Each S2 target 
contained  a dominant  grating at 75% contrast  in the same direction  as the preceding  S1 target (S2 trials were not relevant  to our research  questions  and were excluded  
from all conﬁdence-related  ERP analyses;  see main text). Participants  rated their decision  conﬁdence  at the end of each trial. B) Example  of the neutral stimulus.

encoding  were included.  To alleviate  artifacts  caused by head motion,  
subjects  with mean frame-to-frame  displacement  > 0.1 mm or maximum  
frame-to-frame  displacement  > 0.15 mm were excluded.  The resulting  
dataset contains  493 subjects  (266 females,  age = 22–36 + , subject IDs 
listed in supplementary  material).  The preprocessing  procedures  were 
the same as described  in ( Salehi et al., 2020 ). We applied  the HCP mini- 
mal preprocessing  pipeline  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ) which includes  artifact  
removal,  motion correction,  and registration  to MNI space. All further 
preprocessing  steps used BioimageSuite  ( Joshi et al., 2011 ), including  
regressing  24 motion parameters,  regressing  the mean time courses  of 
the white matter and cerebrospinal  ﬂuid, and the global signal, remov- 
ing the linear trend and low pass ﬁltering.  
2.2. Brain atlases and parcellations  
Three diﬀerent  functional  atlases were used to investigate  whether  
the results depend  on atlas choice. Shen 268 is a 268-parcel  atlas de- 
termined  with a spectral  clustering  algorithm  on resting-state  data of a 
healthy  population  ( Shen et al., 2013 ). Shen 368 is a ﬁner atlas obtained  
by integrating  the parcellation  of cortex from ( Shen et al., 2013 ), subcor-  
tex from the anatomical  Yale Brodmann  Atlas ( Lacadie  et al., 2008 ), and 
cerebellum  from Yeo et al. (2011) . Yeo 1041 was obtained  by integrating  
the subcortical  and cerebellum  parcellation  of the 368-parcel  parcella-  
tion with the 1000-parcel  cortex parcellation  from Yeo et al. (2011) . 
Another  recent functional  atlas Schaefer  400 ( Schaefer  et al., 2018 ) was 
used to further validate  the results (Supplementary  Fig. S3). 
The exemplar-based  individualized  parcellation  method  previously  
proposed  in ( Salehi et al., 2020 ) was used to generate  the individual-  
ized parcellations  for each scan. The algorithm  has three steps: 1) Reg- 
istration  to a group-level  parcellation.  Here we used the Shen 268 atlas 
as the initial group-level  parcellation.  2) Identiﬁcation  of an exemplar  
from each node by maximizing  a submodular  function.  3) Assignment  
of each voxel to the functionally  closest exemplar  while maintaining  
spatial contiguity  to an exemplar.  
The state-speciﬁc  parcellations  were determined  by taking the major- 
ity vote over the individualized  parcellations  for all the subjects  during 
the same task. For example,  a voxel in the working  memory  parcellation  
is assigned  to the node to which the voxel is most frequently  assigned  
across all 493 subject-speciﬁc  working  memory  individualized  parcella-  
tions. 
Based on the nine state-speciﬁc  parcellations,  we obtained  an in- 
tersect parcellation  which only contains  voxels that are assigned  to 
the same node across all state-speciﬁc  parcellations.  Ambiguous  vox- 
els which are assigned  to diﬀerent  nodes under diﬀerent  states were not 
included  in this parcellation  leaving  uncovered  gaps between  nodes. The 
intersect  parcellation  covers approximately  79% of the voxels covered  
in the resting-  state-speciﬁc  parcellation.

evincing  support  for the further decline  in oﬀ-task  thinking  with advanc-  
ing age and deteriorating  cognitive  resources.  This perplexing  develop-  
mental trajectory  of mind-wandering  has catapulted  several explana-  
tions for these age-related  declines  in mind-wandering.  Some theoreti-  
cal models propose  an attenuation  of age-related  reductions  in mind- 
wandering  endorsement  after controlling  for older adults’ increased  
motivation  and interest  of these laboratory-based  tasks ( Jackson  and 
Balota, 2012 ; Krawietz  et al., 2012 ; Shake et al., 2016 ). Other mod- 
els posit declining  executive  control abilities  to constrain  resources  di- 
rected to internally-focused  thoughts,  thereby  decreasing  oﬀ-task  think- 
ing during demanding  cognitive  tasks ( Smallwood  and Schooler,  2006 ). 
Age-related  declines  in mind-wandering  have also been attributed  
to older adults’ need to perform  well on lab-based  cognitive  tasks 
( Soubelet  and Salthouse,  2011 ) and poorer meta-cognition  ( Maillet and 
Schacter,  2016 ), thus questioning  the veridicality  of thought  probes in 
measuring  mind-wandering  with increasing  age. 
Although  there is some evidence  that these endorsements  of mind- 
wandering  may indeed reﬂect older adults’ mind-wandering  propensity  
( Frank et al., 2015 ), there has also been an increasing  interest  in identi- 
fying and developing  more objective  indicators  of mind-wandering.  Re- 
sponse time variability,  or the trial-to-trial  variance  in reaction  time, is 
one such identiﬁed  marker.  Increased  individual  variability  in reaction  
time has been associated  with self-reports  of mind-wandering  episodes  
( Bastian  and Sackur,  2013 ; Henríquez  et al., 2016 ; Jubera-García  et al., 
2020 ; Kucyi et al., 2016 ; Maillet et al., 2020 ) as well as other lapses 
in attention  ( Cheyne  et al., 2009 ; Schooler  et al., 2014 ). Using the 
metronome  response  task, Seli et al. (2013) reported  higher variability  
in response  times preceding  oﬀ-task  thought  probes compared  with vari- 
ability prior to on-task  thought  reports.  Moreover,  there is evidence  from 
neuroimaging  studies supporting  the involvement  of the frontoparietal,  
dorsal attention,  and ventral attention  networks  during oﬀ-task  pro- 
cessing ( Christoﬀ et  al., 2016 ; Esterman  et al., 2013 ; Golchert  et al., 
2017 ; Hasenkamp  et al., 2012 ; Kucyi, 2018 ; Smallwood  et al., 2016 ; 
Turnbull  et al., 2019 ; Yamashita  et al., 2021 ), suggesting  that mind- 
wandering  is a controlled,  regulatory  process  requiring  goal-directed  
neural processing.  Indeed,  mindfulness  meditation  training,  which in- 
volves the cultivation  of sustained  attention,  has been shown to notably  
reduce both self-reported  and behaviorally  measured  mind wandering,  
like response  time variability  ( Mrazek  et al., 2012 ; Whitmoyer  et al., 
2020 ). Thus, with the re-direction  of executive  control resources  to oﬀ- 
task thinking,  less consistent  (more variable)  responding  could be an 
important  online behavioral  correlate  of mind-wandering.  
Additionally,  behavioral  response  variability  has been employed  to 
characterize  distinct  states of attentional  ﬂuctuation  ( Esterman  et al., 
2014 , 2013 ; Yamashita  et al., 2021 ). Consistent  responding  denotes  
an optimal  “in-the-zone  ” state,  whereas  high response  time variabil-  
ity is reﬂective  of an “out-of-the-zone  ” state ( Esterman  et al., 2013 ; 
Esterman  and Rothlein,  2019 ). Functional  magnetic  resonance  imag- 
ing (fMRI) studies comparing  optimal  to suboptimal  states highlight  the 
contribution  of activity  in the default-mode  network  ( Esterman  et al., 
2013 ; Fortenbaugh  et al., 2018 ; Kucyi et al., 2016 ), including  nodes in 
the precuneus,  the anterior  cingulate  cortex, and the temporoparietal  
junction  ( Christoﬀet  al., 2009 ; Mason et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2009 ) 
in supporting  consistent  responding.  In contrast,  activity  in the dorsal 
attention  network,  known traditionally  to subserve  externally  focused  
attention,  was present  during erratic responding  ( Esterman  et al., 2013 ; 
Kucyi et al., 2017 ). 
Altogether,  response  time variability  is an important  metric that 
has been characterized  to reﬂect ﬂuctuations  in attentional  states and 
may be an important  marker  of mind-wandering,  especially  in older 
adults. Although,  the vast majority  of ﬁndings  from fMRI investigations  
of response  time variability  and thought  probes as markers  of mind- 
wandering  to date have largely been based on data from young adults, 
there have been a handful  of studies examining  neural correlates  of 
mind-wandering  in older adults. Mind-wandering  episodes  have been 
linked with reduced  communication  between  temporal  and prefrontal  regions  of the default mode network  ( Martinon  et al., 2019 ) and a re- 
duced engagement  of the medial and lateral prefrontal  cortex as well 
as the left superior  temporal  gyrus ( Maillet et al., 2019 ) in older adults. 
Other work has shown that mind-wandering  frequency  in older adults 
is associated  with changes  in connectivity  within the default mode net- 
work. Speciﬁcally,  these include  an increased  connectivity  between  re- 
gions of the lateral and medial temporal  lobes and a decreased  connec-  
tivity between  the temporal  pole and the dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex 
( O’Callaghan  et al., 2015 ). One common  limitation  is that previous  fMRI 
studies were guided by a priori assumptions  that involved  focusing  on 
speciﬁc  brain regions  or networks.  Additionally,  most previous  studies 
typically  employed  classical  univariate  analysis  based on general  lin- 
ear model or group-level  inferences.  One prominent  drawback  of these 
methods  is the lack of proper characterization  of brain function  at the 
individual  level ( Dubois and Adolphs,  2016 ). 
More recently,  network  neuroscience  methods  have been compli-  
mented  by advances  in machine  learning,  allowing  us to gain unprece-  
dented insight into the neural mechanisms  underlying  cognitive  func- 
tioning.  One such approach  is connectome-based  predictive  modeling  
(CPM; Shen et al., 2017 ). CPM is a novel whole-brain,  data-driven  tech- 
nique that allows for the derivation  of brain-based  predictive  models 
from individualized  functional  connectivity  patterns.  Moreover,  CPM 
allows for the identiﬁcation  of whole-brain  functional  connections  that 
are associated  with target cognitive  function.  Using whole brain, task- 
based, or resting state functional  connectivity,  several recent studies 
have demonstrated  the utility of the CPM technique  in identifying  indi- 
vidual diﬀerences  in brain functional  architecture.  These have allowed  
for the construction  of brain-based  models capable  of predicting  ﬂuid 
intelligence  ( Finn et al., 2015 ), processing  speed ( Gao et al., 2020 ), at- 
tention  ( Rosenberg  et al., 2016 ), reading  ability ( Jangraw  et al., 2018 ), 
working  memory  ( Avery et al., 2020; Manglani  et al., 2021 ), loneliness  
( Feng et al., 2019 ), mind-wandering  ( Kucyi et al., 2021 ), or even dis- 
eased states such as Alzheimer’s  disease  ( Lin et al., 2018 ) and attention  
deﬁcit hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD;  Barron et al., 2020 ). A recent fMRI 
study demonstrated  the utility of CPM to build generalizable  models of 
mind-wandering,  as measured  using an experience  sampling  method,  in 
healthy  young adults and adults with ADHD ( Kucyi et al., 2021 ). 
Here, leveraging  the CPM framework,  we examined  whether  re- 
sponse time variability  can be predicted  from whole-brain  functional  
connectivity  in a cross-sectional  sample of cognitively  normal  older 
adults. Response  time variability  was quantiﬁed  using the reaction  time 
coeﬃcient  of variation  (RT_CV)  calculated  as the standard  deviation  of 
reaction  time/mean  reaction  time. Using data from publicly  available  
datasets,  we ﬁrst investigated  whether  functional  connectivity  during 
an intrascanner  Go/NoGo  task and resting-state  fMRI could predict re- 
sponse time variability.  We also explored  the utility of our model in pre- 
dicting individual  response  time variability  in two independent  cohorts  
of healthy  older adults. We hypothesized  that task-based,  whole-brain  
models of functional  connectivity  would explain  signiﬁcant  individual  
diﬀerences  in response  time variability  in older adults with nodes of the 
default mode network,  dorsal attention  network,  and the ventral atten- 
tion network  showing  the highest  contributions.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Datasets  overview  
We analyzed  functional  MRI and behavioral  data in 407 cognitively  
normal  older adults between  the ages of 65–85 years from three inde- 
pendent  cohorts.  These datasets  were from the publicly  available  Human  
Connectome  Project in Aging ( Bookheimer  et al., 2019 ; Harms et al., 
2018 ) (HCP-Aging)  and Cambridge  Centre for Ageing Neuroscience  
(Cam-CAN;  Shafto et al., 2014 ; Taylor et al., 2017 ) databases.  The 
third dataset,  Studying  Cognitive  and Neural Aging (SCAN;  Fountain-  
Zaragoza  et al., 2021 ), was acquired  by our group here at The Ohio 
State University,  Columbus,  OH. In the present  study, the HCP-Aging  
2  O. Gbadeyan,  J. Teng and R.S. Prakash NeuroImage  250 (2022) 118890 
was used as the primary  dataset for model derivation  and internal  val- 
idation.  Cam-CAN  and SCAN served as the validation  datasets  used to 
assess the generalizability  of the derived  models.  
2.2. Participants  
2.2.1. HCP-Aging  
HCP-Aging  is an ongoing  multisite  study designed  to acquire  norma-  
tive neuroimaging  and behavioral  data for examining  changes  in brain 
organization  during typical aging. The dataset used in the current  study 
was drawn from the ﬁrst release (Lifespan  HCP Release  1.0) and com- 
prised of 689 cognitively  healthy  older adults (36–105  years). Partici-  
pants were excluded  from the HCP-Aging  study if they had been diag- 
nosed and treated for major neuropsychiatric  and neurological  disor- 
ders. Those with impaired  cognitive  abilities  were also excluded.  In the 
current  study, we began by restricting  our analysis  to participants  who 
are unrelated,  aged 65–85 years, right-handed,  and with fMRI and be- 
havioral  data available  ( n = 189). We then excluded  participants  with 
outlier performance  (see Datasets  description:  Cognitive  tasks) during 
cognitive  task ( n = 8). Of the remaining  participants,  those with exces- 
sive head motion during fMRI ( n = 35, described  below in Head Motion  
Control)  and incidental  ﬁnding  ( n = 1) were also excluded.  Data for

In a diﬀerent  study, participants  given neurofeedback  were able to im- 
prove their ability to sustain attention  ( deBettencourt  et al., 2015 ). Re- 
searchers  have even been able to induce perceptual  learning  of a partic- 
ular stimulus  orientation  without  visual presentation  of that orientation  
and without  participants  becoming  aware of what was being trained  
( Shibata  et al., 2011 ). 
Clinical  studies have also used fMRI neurofeedback  to treat neu- 
ropsychiatric  and neurodevelopmental  disorders;  for a comprehensive  
listing of these studies as of mid-2020,  see Table 1 from Linden (2021) , 
and for a recent review see Taschereau-Dumouchel  et al. (2022) . To give 
one example,  depressed  patients  who underwent  fMRI neurofeedback  
training  to increase  amygdala  activity  while recalling  positive  autobio-  
graphical  memories  showed  a decrease  in depressive  symptoms;  these 
eﬀects were speciﬁc  to when neurofeedback  was based on amygdala  ac- 
tivation  vs. activation  of a control region in parietal  cortex ( Young et al., 
2017 ; for further discussion  see Young et al., 2021 , 2018 ). Notably,  sev- 
eral clinical  studies have obtained  promising  results using the Decoded  
Neurofeedback  (DecNef)  approach,  in which participants  are given feed- 
back to boost activation  of a particular  neural pattern  without  being 
told what the neural pattern  is (for recent reviews,  see Shibata  et al., 
2019 ; Taschereau-Dumouchel  et al., 2021 ; Watanabe  et al., 2017 ). For 
example,  one DecNef  study showed  that training  individuals  with snake 
or spider phobias  to activate  a pattern  corresponding  to snakes or spi- 
ders (respectively),  in the absence  of viewing  the phobia-triggering  stim- 
uli, and without  knowledge  that the target neural patterns  related to 
snakes or spiders,  led to decreased  skin conductance  fear responses  
to these stimuli ( Taschereau-Dumouchel  et al., 2018 ; for an example  
of a similar approach  to treating  post-traumatic  stress disorder,  see 
Chiba et al., 2019 ). Other clinical  studies have obtained  promising  re- 
sults by providing  feedback  based on functional  connectivity.  For ex- 
ample, Ramot et al. (2017) used RT-fMRI  neurofeedback  in individuals  
with Autism Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD) to reinforce  functional  connectiv-  
ity (i.e., correlation  in fMRI timeseries)  between  brain regions  that are 
underconnected  in ASD relative  to controls;  the training  led to increases  
in functional  connectivity  that lasted up to a year and were correlated  
with improvements  in behavioral  symptoms.  
Challenges  with RT-fMRI  
Importantly,  despite the strong potential  of RT-fMRI,  its uptake has 
been limited by several factors.  First and foremost,  setting up real-time  
analysis  pipelines  is technically  challenging:  A real-time  communica-  
tion bridge needs to be built to connect  scripts across multiple  processes  
so that an incoming  DICOM  image can be transferred  and analyzed,  
and then participant  feedback  can be presented  based on the analy- 
sis results in a timely fashion.  Clinical  sites in particular  may lack the 
software  engineering  and IT expertise  needed  to assemble  this pipeline.  
A second factor is that the computational  complexity  of fMRI analysis  
has escalated  substantially  over the past two decades.  Whereas,  previ- 
ously, the ﬁeld relied almost exclusively  on univariate  measures  (e.g., 
average  activation  in a region of interest),  researchers  have increas-  
ingly come to rely on more computationally-demanding  and sensitive  
multivariate  analyses  (e.g., pattern  classiﬁers  and functional  alignment  
algorithms;  Cohen et al., 2017 ). This increase  in the use of multivari-  
ate methods  has occurred  both for oﬄine analysis  and also real-time  
analysis  (e.g., deBettencourt  et al., 2015 , 2019 ; Iordan et al., 2020 ; 
LaConte  et al., 2007 ; Shibata  et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2016 ). A third 
factor relates to the lack of open standards  for RT-fMRI  research.  Of- 
ﬂine fMRI analysis  has been the focus of signiﬁcant  eﬀorts at standard-  
ization:  for example,  development  of the Brain Imaging  Data Structure  
(BIDS; Gorgolewski  et al., 2016 ) and fMRIPrep  ( Esteban  et al., 2019 ). 
However,  these new standards  generally  have not been applied  in the 
RT-fMRI  domain.  This lack of standards  has led RT-fMRI  researchers  to 
use a wide variety of diﬀerent  (and incompatible)  pipelines  in their re- 
search, which in turn has made it more diﬃcult  to share work, reproduce  
results,  and reuse components.  Addressing  the challenges  of RT-fMRI  using cloud computing  
As described  above, many of the challenges  of RT-fMRI  revolve  
around building  and deploying  a set of coordinating  software  compo-  
nents and harnessing  enough  computing  power to complete  analysis  in 
time. This general  set of challenges  is not unique to RT-fMRI  and in fact 
is common  among many computer  applications  including  e-commerce,  
data analytics,  AI, and web-based  communication.  A common  theme 
in the past decade has been to harness  the power of cloud computing  
to simplify,  standardize  and reduce the cost of creating  and deploying  
applications.  
A classic example  of an application  that has primarily  moved to the 
cloud is email. Without  the cloud, a company  would need to install an 
email server in their server room, and then install email clients on all 
employee  computers.  Whenever  there would be an application  update,  
the IT group would need to push out the new email client to all employee  
laptops.  Some percentage  of users would encounter  a problem  because  
of an outdated  OS, insuﬃcient  storage  space, the wrong libraries,  and 
so on. With email running  in the cloud, the server runs in the cloud 
and the employees  access their email through  a web browser.  There is 
no installation  on each computer  and employees  can access their email 
from anywhere.  If the email server becomes  too slow, it can be scaled 
up instantly  and more storage  can be added as needed.  This on-demand  
model is known as Software-as-a-Service,  or SaaS. 
Here, we describe  RT-Cloud,  a newly-developed,  open-source  
software  framework  written  in Python 3 that leverages  cloud 
computing  and SaaS to address  the challenges  of RT-fMRI  
(https://github.com/brainiak/rt-cloud).  With RT-Cloud,  the real- 
time fMRI analysis  software  is installed  on cloud computers  and 
is accessible  from any web browser;  only one lightweight  software  
component  is installed  locally (to forward  images up to the cloud). This 
setup makes it possible  to run highly complex  fMRI analyses  in real 
time, even in situations  where the scanning  facility does not itself have 
extensive  computing  resources  or IT expertise.  To facilitate  the sharing  
of pipelines  and data, RT-Cloud  also takes advantage  of the BIDS data 
standard  for fMRI, as described  in the Integration  with BIDS section 
below. In this section,  we provide  an overview  of the key advantages  
that cloud computing  and SaaS provide  for RT-fMRI:  ease of setup 
and maintenance,  lowering  of costs, ease of scaling,  and accessibility  
from anywhere;  in the section after this one, we describe  the RT-Cloud  
framework  in more detail. 
• Ease of setup and maintenance.  With cloud-based  computing,  all in- 
stallation  and maintenance  are on a single cloud virtual machine  
(VM) image and that image is used to instantiate  each VM at startup,  
thus ensuring  that all instantiations  are identical.  This means that 
quality control can be addressed  centrally,  ensuring  that the project 
meets strict and consistent  standards  for system functionality,  library 
compatibility  and security.  In addition,  the installation  and mainte-  
nance can all be done remotely  by a centralized  team —and often 
just a single person —r a t h e r  than separately  at each facility,  thus 
reducing  IT costs and time. This is especially  important  when deploy-  
ing in clinical  settings  where the availability  of specialized  hardware  
and technical  staﬀto do software  installations  and maintenance  may 
be limited.  
• Lowering  of costs. Cloud is a “pay for what you use ”m o d e l .  So, for 
example,  two hours of cloud computer  time to run a session will 
cost about $1-$2. Cloud savings  occur because  of the ability to spin 
up and spin down hardware  on demand.  Within our framework,  
cloud VMs are only running  during the scanning  session and then 
are stopped  when the session is done. This on-demand  nature elim- 
inates the primary  cost of owning  hardware,  which is equipment  
idle-time.  
• Ease of scaling. Cloud computing  also enables  system scaling,  both 
out and up. Scaling  out is the addition  of more of the same type of 
resource  (i.e. more VMs) to accomodate  more simultaneous  studies.  
2  G. Wallace, S. Polcyn, P.P. Brooks et al. NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119295 
This is important  to enable large-scale  deployment  with simultane-  
ous usage at multiple  sites. Scaling  up is the allocation  of larger VM 
instances  (faster, more cores, more memory)  to accommodate  higher 
processing  demands  of an individual  experiment.  This is very help- 
ful as experimental  designs  and computational  demands  change.  The 
result is that, rather than committing  to a $10,000  piece of hardware  
today, only to ﬁnd it is insuﬃcient  tomorrow  (or conversely  is over- 
powered  and thus mostly idle), you can simply rent the right VM

• Accessibility  from anywhere.  The Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS) model 
is transforming  many industries  by simplifying  application  deploy-  
ment; as noted in the email example  above, this model involves  in- 
stalling  an application  on the cloud and having users access the ap- 
plication  through  a web browser,  without  installing  libraries  or soft- 
ware on their local computer  or laptop. This has major advantages  in 
the context  of fMRI. Since MRI scanners  are typically  heavily  booked  
and tightly scheduled,  experimenters  do not want to waste time in 
the control room logging  in to software  and entering  session conﬁg- 
urations.  SaaS makes it possible  for researchers  to do these prelimi-  
naries outside  of the control room on any web-accessible  computer,  
so they will be ready to immediately  begin the experiment  when 
they get into the control room. It also makes it possible  to install, 
maintain  and test the experiment  from a laptop outside  of the con- 
trol room, and then use the same interface  to run the experiment,  
thus ensuring  smooth  operation.  As improvements  are made to the 
service,  users can have access to those immediately,  never having to 
wonder  or check if their computer  has enough  memory,  the right OS 
version,  the right libraries,  and so on. 
The RT-Cloud  framework  
Overview  of framework  
The RT-Cloud  software  framework  provides  the basic infrastruc-  
ture needed  to run an RT-fMRI  experiment.  The framework  wraps 
experiment-speciﬁc  code that the researcher  provides,  thus providing  a 
pluggable  model that reduces  the complexity  and time of setting up and 
running  an experiment.  RT-Cloud  was co-developed  with the BrainIAK  
suite of Python tools for advanced  fMRI analysis  (https://brainiak.org;  
Kumar et al., 2021 ). Users can deploy BrainIAK  analysis  modules  in their 
custom  analysis  code, or they can use other tools if they wish. During 
execution,  the RT-Cloud  framework  handles  details such as starting  and 
stopping  the analysis  pipeline,  getting fMRI images in real-time,  and 
handling  data communication  between  components  such as for images,  
analysis  results,  and participants’  responses.  
The framework  has two major components,  the FileWatcher  and the 
ProjectServer.  The FileWatcher  watches  for and forwards  DICOMs  as 
they arrive from the MRI scanner,  while the ProjectServer  coordinates  
between  the FileWatcher,  the researcher’s  analysis  script, and the feed- 
back presentation  shown to participants.  In addition,  the framework  has 
two web interfaces:  the Experiment  Control  web page, which allows the 
researcher  to control the experiment  session,  and the Subject  Feedback  
web page, which can be used to present  stimuli to participants.  
To elaborate,  the FileWatcher  runs on a computer  in the control room 
and requires  minimal  processing  power. Once parameters  on the scan- 
ner computer  are set so that DICOM  images are made accessible,  the 
FileWatcher  registers  for ﬁle-system  notiﬁcations  to watch for the ar- 
rival of new DICOM  images from the scanner.  Each new DICOM  is read, 
converted  to a BIDS format using the BIDS-Incremental  system that we 
created  for this purpose  (see the Integration  with BIDS section for more 
details),  and forwarded  to the ProjectServer  using standard  network  pro- 
tocols. 
The ProjectServer  is deployed  on a system with enough  processing  
power to quickly  analyze  the incoming  brain-volume  data in time for the 
participant  to receive  neurofeedback,  in about 1 to 2 s. This component  
usually  runs on the cloud but it can also run on a local computer  or cluster.  As noted in the previous  section,  running  this component  in the 
cloud makes it possible  to scale computing  resources  as a function  of 
the complexity  of the analysis,  by either scaling up the VM instance  or 
splitting  the processing  into parallel  components  across multiple  VMs. 
The experiment  can be controlled  by interacting  with the Project-  
Server via the Experiment  Control  web page, which is typically  accessed  
from a laptop. This web page allows the researcher  to change conﬁgura-  
tion settings,  start and stop runs, and view analysis  results in real time. 
The Subject  Feedback  web page is made visible to the participants  –
this web page can be ﬂexibly  used to present  stimuli to participants,  in- 
cluding  (but not limited to) neurofeedback  based on the results of the 
RT-fMRI  analysis.  Moreover,  this web interface  can also collect behav- 
ioral responses  (e.g., button presses)  from participants  (see the Integra-  
tion with Experiment  Scripting  Packages  section below).  Fig. 1 illustrates  
how the framework  components  ﬁt together  to complete  the neurofeed-  
back loop. 
Integration  with BIDS 
To facilitate  the re-use of existing  pipelines  and data, RT-Cloud  sup- 
ports BIDS, the leading  standard  for fMRI data ( Gorgolewski  et al., 
2016 ). BIDS is supported  by a wide variety of formatting  and analy- 
sis tools and data repositories.  For example,  BIDS is used by the Open- 
Neuro database  ( Gorgolewski,  Esteban,  et al., 2017 ; Markiewicz  et al., 
2021 ), a large and growing  repository  of neuroscience  datasets  (in- 
corporating  fMRI and also other data types). BIDS has an automated  
and comprehensive  validation  tool that analyzes  datasets  for compli-  
ance and identiﬁes  issues ( Gorgolewski  et al., 2016 ). It also is the 
data format used by “BIDS Apps ”, which are container-based  applica-  
tions with a standardized  interface  that work on BIDS-formated  datasets  
( Gorgolewski,  Alfaro-Almagro,  et al., 2017 ). 
BIDS archives  include  brain volumes  stored in NIfTI format,  and have 
meta-data  stored in separate  “sidecar  ”ﬁles, typically  with JSON or TSV 
(tab separated  value) formating.  BIDS archives  also have a standard  di- 
rectory  structure  and ﬁle naming  convention.  Included  in the ﬁle names 
are “BIDS entities  ”such as the subject name, session,  task, and run. 
BIDS is designed  as an archival  standard  (i.e. for data-at-rest),  but 
RT-fMRI  requires  streams  of data in order to process  brain-volumes  
as they arrive from the scanner.  An adaptation  is required  to support  
streaming  data in a BIDS-compliant  manner.  Here, we introduce  a data 
structure  called the “BIDS-Incremental  ”, which is an in-memory  BIDS 
archive  with only one brain volume  and associated  meta-data  in it. BIDS- 
Incrementals  allow us to package  and stream DICOM  images one at a 
time as they arrive oﬀthe scanner  and send them to the ProjectServer  
for analysis.  
BIDS-Incrementals  must hold the proper data structures  to be com- 
patible with a BIDS archive.  These data structures  include:  the NIfTI 
image; a metadata  dictionary  describing  the image; and several sup- 
porting  data structures  that map to ﬁles in a BIDS archive  (namely,  the 
events ﬁle that includes  information  about the stimuli presented  to the 
participant,  a README  ﬁle with general  information  about the experi- 
ment, and a JSON ﬁle that describes  the dataset).  In addition,  the data 
structure  must be fast enough  to support  all operations  well within the 
typical 1–2 second repetition  time (TR) window  in which a brain volume  
is acquired.  There are three main operations  that the software  supports:  
1) creating  a BIDS-Incremental  from a DICOM  image; 2) appending  a 
BIDS-Incremental  to a BIDS archive;  and 3) reading  a BIDS-Incremental  
from a BIDS archive;  these operations  are illustrated  in Fig. 2 . The ﬁrst 
two operations  support  streaming  live data as it arrives from a scanner  
and accumulating  it into a BIDS archive  during processing.  The third 
supports  “replaying  ”or re-processing,  through  a real-time  pipeline,  data 
that have been previously  collected  and stored in a BIDS archive.  This 
“replay  ”workﬂow  is very useful for testing an analysis  pipeline.  Instead  
of collecting  new data in real time, users can just take an existing  dataset 
and run it through  the pipeline  to see how well everything  is working  
(see section below on Integration  with OpenNeuro  ).

Fig. 1. Schematic  of our RT-Cloud  framework:  (1a) The FileWatcher  watches  for new DICOM images arriving  from the scanner,  (1b) sends them to the BIDS- 
Incremental  system for conversion  to a BIDS-formated  NIfTI image, and (1c) then sends this image to the ProjectServer,  running on the cloud. (2) The ProjectServer,  
which wraps the researcher’s  code, processes  the NIfTI image and runs the analysis  code to obtain a measure  of the participant’s  brain state (e.g., whether  they are 
attending  to a face or a scene). The researcher  accesses  the cloud application  from a browser  page that can run on a laptop. Among many things, the researcher  can 
initiate/ﬁnalize  the session, change settings,  and even observe the graph output of the analysis  results from this browser  page. (3) The analysis  results are provided  
to the participant  as neurofeedback  presented  on a display screen in the MRI room. Note that RT-Cloud  can also be installed  on a local computer  or cluster node in 
lieu of using the cloud. Figure adapted  with permission  from Kumar et al. (2021) . 
Fig. 2. BIDS Support:  We have adapted  the typical data-at-rest  BIDS standard  to real-time  streaming  by developing  a BIDS-Incremental  system. As data arrive from 
the scanner,  we create single-volume  BIDS archives  that are streamed  to the real-time  analysis  engine on the cloud. These single-volume  archives  can be appended  
in the cloud to create a BIDS archive that encompasses  the entire run, and they can also be replayed  one volume at a time to simulate  a real-time  experiment.  
To satisfy real-time  requirements,  these BIDS-Incremental  operations  
must be completed  quickly,  ideally within a couple tens of milliseconds  
to avoid impacting  overall real-time  deadlines.  Initial implementations  
of the BIDS-Incremental  relied on disk-backed  operations,  such as ap- 
pending  to or reading  from an on-disk  BIDS archive.  However,  as an 
experiment  continues  and accumulates  data, the on-disk  archive  grows 
in size and eventually  operations  exceed a completion  time threshold.  
To counter  this issue, we leverage  the fact that real-time  fMRI users 
typically  work one scanning  run at a time; by caching  a run’s worth 
of BIDS data in-memory,  we can optimize  operations  that are in the 
time-critical  portion  of an experiment.  Other operations,  like writing  or 
reading  a run’s worth of data to or from disk, can be done before or 
after the time-sensitive  section of a real-time  fMRI workﬂow.  We de- 
veloped  this mechanism  into a data structure  called a “BIDS Run ”, an 
in-memory  cache of BIDS-Incrementals  corresponding  to one run in the 
experiment.  The above data structures  that provide  BIDS support  within the 
framework  leverage  their implementation  on PyBIDS,  a software  pack- 
age produced  by the BIDS Standard  maintainers  that provides  a set of 
utilities  for interacting  with and manipulating  BIDS data ( Halchenko  
et al., 2020 ). In addition,  NiBabel  ( Brett et al., 2020 ) and dcm2niix  
( Li et al., 2016 ) are used for NIfTI image handling.  
Supporting  BIDS within RT-Cloud  has many beneﬁts.  Data that are 
collected  and stored in BIDS format can be readily understood  and used 
by other researchers  and can be replayed  through  the RT-Cloud  frame- 
work. In addition,  if an RT-Cloud  experiment  is encapsulated  as a BIDS 
App (see Current  and future directions  section below),  then the full soft- 
ware environment  needed  to run the experiment  is made available  to 
users, including  not only the analysis  scripts, but also any libraries  and 
conﬁgurations  required.  If a user shares both their BIDS App and their 
BIDS data with a second user, the second user will have everything  
needed  to replay, validate,  and modify the study.

Scan time (1 - 9x longer scans) 1 - 3 
Two key requirements  that distinguish  mouse MRI from human MRI 
are throughput  and resolution.  The challenge  of throughput  is the result 
of two factors:  mouse MRI scans are generally  slower than equivalent  
human ones when matching  matrix size but scaling down the ﬁeld of 
view; and mice experiments  frequently  produce  cohorts  of multiple  ani- 
mals requiring  imaging  according  to a strict timeline,  often within 24 h 
of a desired  time point. This throughput  problem  can be addressed  in 
large part by imaging  mice concurrently  in the same scanner,  through  
an approach  called multiple-mouse  MRI, which reduces  the overall time 
needed  to image a cohort of mice several fold. There are several po- 
tential conﬁgurations  for multiple-mouse  MRI ( Bock et al., 2003 ). The 
simplest  strategy  is to place multiple  samples  within a single RF coil. 
This approach  has been demonstrated  with a solenoidal  MR coil for in 
vivo imaging  of up to 13 mice simultaneously  on a 1.5 T clinical  scan- 
ner ( Xu et al., 2003 ), and with a single bird cage coil to image close- 
packed embryos  ex vivo , imaging  as many as 32 embryos  simultane-  
ously ( Schneider  et al., 2004 ). Alternatively,  Lazovic  et al. presented  a 
tailored  hexagonal  coil design with sensitivity  in six distinct  regions-  
of-interest,  enabling  imaging  of six neonatal  rats ( Lazovic  et al., 2005 ). 
Exploiting  both multiple  transmitters  and receivers,  typical of modern  
MRI systems,  enables  use of coils tailored  to individual  samples.  This 
was the preferred  conﬁguration  explored  by Bock et al. ( Bock et al., 
2003 ) and has been used to image 7 live mouse brains simultaneously  
at our site for years ( Bock et al., 2005 ). The same approach  using a 
shielded  solenoid  array similarly  enables  imaging  of 16 ex vivo samples  
simultaneously  ( Nieman  et al., 2018 ). Matsuda  et al. combined  a mul- 
tichannel  transmitter-receiver  system with a novel multi-sample  gradi- 
ent array housed in a large-bore  magnet,  which enabled  imaging  of up 
to 100 samples  at high spatial resolution  ( Matsuda  et al., 2003 ). It is 
also possible  to employ  multiple  receiver  arrays for multiple-mouse  MRI 
( Ramirez  et al., 2010 ), duplicating  the parallel  coil conﬁguration  used 
on clinical  MRI systems.  These approaches,  with appropriate  adaptation,  
can achieve  image results similar or equivalent  to single mouse imag- 
ing for many imaging  applications,  including  in vivo cardiac  imaging  
( Bishop et al., 2006 ; Esparza-Coss  et al., 2008 ). 
A second consideration  in mouse MRI is the need for increased  res- 
olution.  Due to its much smaller  size, mouse MRI requires  a 10- to 15- 
fold increase  in resolution  in each linear dimension  compared  to human 
MRI. This is accompanied  by a loss in signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR) that 
must be compensated  for by modiﬁcations  of hardware  and/or imag- 
ing methods.  A representative  SNR budget in transitioning  from human 
to preclinical  MRI is provided  in Table 1 (based on published  reports 
( Hoult and Lauterbur,  1979 ; Edelstein  et al., 1986 ; Doty et al., 2007 ; 
DiFrancesco  et al., 2008 )). Specialized  radiofrequency  (RF) coils, strong 
magnetic  ﬁelds, and longer scan times are common  approaches  to pro- 
vide the needed  SNR increase.  A complementary  approach,  now imple- 
mented  commercially,  is the use of cryogenically  cooled RF probes (e.g., 
Bruker’s  CryoProbe  TM ), in which a closed-loop  cryogen  cooling  system 
is used to reduce the noise contributions  from the electrical  conductors  
and the pre-ampliﬁer  in the receiver  chain for each coil (eﬀectively  shift- 
ing considerations  to the left-most,  sample-noise  dominated  regime of 
Table 1 ). Depending  on imaging  geometry  and coil conﬁguration,  this 
results in a 2- to 5-fold SNR gain over equivalent  room temperature  coils ( Ratering  et al., 2008 ; Baltes et al., 2009 ; Wagenhaus  et al., 2012 ) (with 
greater beneﬁt expected  at lower ﬁeld strengths).  This technology  has 
already  been shown to have signiﬁcant  beneﬁt for evaluation  of brain 
structure  at high resolution  ( Baltes et al., 2009 ), resting-state  functional  
MRI ( Mechling  et al., 2014 ), high-resolution  diﬀusion  tensor imaging  
( Wu et al., 2013 ), cardiac  imaging  ( Wagenhaus  et al., 2012 ), and non- 
proton imaging/spectroscopy  ( Sack et al., 2014 ). 
In the current  work, we combine  the throughput  beneﬁts  of multiple-  
mouse MRI with the SNR beneﬁts  of CryoProbes.  We demonstrate  the 
use of four individual  CryoProbes  in the same gradient  bore for high- 
resolution  imaging  of four mice simultaneously  for in vivo structural  
characterization  of the developing  mouse brain. 
As an example  application  of this system,  we studied  a mouse model 
of Sanﬁlippo  syndrome,  one of a group of genetic  disorders  known as 
mucopolysaccharidoses  (MPS) that result from deﬁciency  of lysosomal  
enzymes  and failure to break down glycosaminoglycans  ( Shapiro  et al., 
2017 ). Sanﬁlippo  syndrome,  known as MPS type III, results in accu- 
mulation  of heparan  sulfate and leads to neurological  impairments  
and shortened  life expectancy  in humans.  Initially,  speech and com- 
munication  symptoms  may present  similar to those manifest  in autism 
( Wolfenden  et al., 2017 ), but progression  of neurodegeneration  leads 
to severe cognitive  impairment  ( Valstar et al., 2011 ). Neuroimaging  in 
MPSIII patients  has revealed  white matter abnormalities,  brain atrophy,  
and hydrocephalus  ( Bigger et al., 2018 ), though the overall timeline  of 
brain development  in the early stages is largely uncharacterized.  MP- 
SIII type C is caused by mutations  in the heparan-alpha-glucosaminide  
N-acetyltransferase  (HGSNAT)  gene. A knockout  mouse model of MP- 
SIIIC, Hgsnat − / − , has been reported  to exhibit progressive  neuroinﬂam-  
mation,  altered behavior,  and a slightly  shortened  life span ( S. Marcó
et al., 2016 ). We used our multiple-mouse  MRI system with CryoProbes  
to quantify  brain development  through  early life and into adulthood  in 
Hgsnat + / + , Hgsnat + / − and Hgsnat − / − mice. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Multiple-Mouse  MRI setup 
Experiments  were performed  on a 7-Tesla  306-mm  horizontal  bore 
magnet  (BioSpec  70/30 USR, Bruker,  Ettlingen,  Germany)  with Avance  
III HD electronics  and ParaVision  6.0.1 console  software.  The system 
was equipped  with a BGA-20S  water-cooled  gradient  system with 200.5 
mm inner diameter,  300 mT/m maximum  amplitude,  and 1000 T/m/s 
maximum  slew rate. The instrument  was equipped  with four CryoProbes  
suitable  for mouse head imaging  (RF CP F2.5 300 1H 56/20, Bruker,  
Ettlingen,  Germany).  Each probe consists  of a double-loop  surface coil 
mounted  on a 20-mm inner diameter  half-shell  (superior  to the mouse’s  
head) and operated  in quadrature  as a two-channel  array in trans- 
mit/receive  mode. The spectrometer  electronics  are equipped  with two 
transmit  and 16 receive  channels  (8 of which are required  for operation  
of the CryoProbes).  For the data in this paper, the four coils (with two 
channels  each) were connected  to eight independent  receivers  and to a 
single radiofrequency  transmit  channel  and ampliﬁer  through  an 8-way 
splitter (with appropriate  phase shifts for quadrature  operation  of each 
probe).

Fig. 1. Multiple-mouse  MRI implementation  with CryoProbes.  (A) A Bruker 70/30 USR magnet was equipped  with four CryoProbes  mounted  on a 2 ×2 square 
frame. A photo of the setup is provided  in (A). A rendering  showing  the placement  of the coils in the bore is provided  in (B). Four mouse beds constructed  using 3D 
printed parts were fabricated  and are pictured  on the table in (A) and rendered  in detail in (C). At run time, an initial pilot image is generated  covering  all four coils. 
Scan prescription  for multiple-mouse  images is achieved  by generation  of a primary  ﬁeld-of-view  (blue, D), with secondary  ﬁelds of view constrained  by coil array 
geometry  (green, D). 
2.2. MRI scanning  
To facilitate  coordinated  prescription  of multiple-mouse  MRI ﬁelds- 
of-view  (FOVs) a two-step  prescription  procedure  was established.  First, 
a two-dimensional  reference  scan was acquired  for localization  of all 
mice. A standard  unmodiﬁed  Bruker FLASH sequence  was used for this 
purpose,  with a ﬁve-slice  prescription  (one transverse  plane, two hori- 
zontal, and two sagittal  slices) with FOVs covering  the whole bore. This 
pilot scan provided  an image in each of the principle  orthogonal  di- 
rections  through  all four mice and conﬁrmed  correct mouse placement.  
Next, individual  pulse sequences  were adapted  for multiple-mouse  imag- 
ing using an image geometry  that consisted  of four secondary  FOVs 
whose location  and dimensions  were determined  based on a single pri- 
mary FOV centered  on the origin. The relative  positions  of the secondary  
FOVs were encoded  in a text ﬁle that deﬁned  their geometric  location  in 
the bore, thus allowing  easy switching  between  alternate  array geome-  
tries. The primary  and secondary  FOVs were displayed  in the geometry  
editor window  of the ParaVision  software  at run time for graphical  ad- 
justment  as needed  ( Fig. 1 D). Subsequent  reconstruction  for each coil 
utilized  the ﬁxed array geometry  and the periodicity  of the discrete  
Fourier  transform  to center images at the appropriate  location  in the 
gradient  bore. 
Three-dimensional  imaging  was performed  with the frequency-  
encoding  axis along the longest  FOV direction  (rostral-caudal).  For 
all 3D imaging  experiments,  a “cylindrical  ”a c q u i s i t i o n  was used in 
which only phase-encode  grid points lying within a speciﬁed  ra- 
dius were collected  (eliminating  ∼22% of points in the corners  of k- 
space) ( Noakes  et al., 2017 ). Images were reconstructed  oﬀ-line  us- 
ing a purpose-written  python script (available  on the Mouse Imag- 
ing center GitHub  page, https://github.com/Mouse-  Imaging-  center/  
MICe-lab  ). Images for each mouse were reconstructed  separately  with 
geometry  centered  on the associated  coil based on each CryoProbe’s  
position  in the bore. Geometric  distortion  from imaging  oﬀ-center  
was measured  for post-processing  correction  as previously  described  
( Nieman  et al., 2018 ). In brief, 3D-printed  phantoms  were placed in 
15-ml centrifuge  tubes and imaged  at 60- 𝜇m isotropic  resolution  within 
each CryoProbe.  Corresponding  images for each phantom  were acquired  
with micro-computed  tomography  (22 𝜇m, Bruker Skyscan  1272). Tag points were manually  placed in all images and the resulting  registration  
used to compute  a transform  correcting  for distortion.  
For demonstration  of the approach,  two diﬀerent  sequences  were 
adapted  for multiple-mouse  acquisition.  The ﬁrst was a standard  3D 
FLASH sequence,  which was used in combination  with manganese  (Mn)- 
enhanced  MRI (MEMRI).  For this purpose,  mice received  an intraperi-  
toneal injection  of 0.4 mmol/kg  Mn 24 h prior to imaging.  Mouse brain 
images were then obtained  at an isotropic  spatial resolution  of 60 𝜇m 
with 𝛼= 26°, TR = 32 ms , TE = 8 ms , FOV = 25 ×22 ×22 mm 3 , 2 repetitions,  
and a scan time of 112 min. To limit ﬂow-related  artifact  in the blood 
vessels (since inﬂow from the neck produced  high blood signal),  the 
standard  trapezoidal  phase-encode  gradient  shapes were modiﬁed  to a 
bipolar  pair of equal duration  with amplitudes  set to ensure a constant  
ﬁrst moment  for all phase-encode  steps. This increased  the echo time 
(TE), which was partially  compensated  through  use of a partial Fourier  
acquisition  in the frequency-encoding  direction  (20% unacquired;  since 
the ﬁrst gradient  moment  in this direction  is constant  across TR peri- 
ods, it was left unmodiﬁed).  To limit physiological  artifact  due to res- 
piration,  acquisition  of adjacent  phase encode points was separated  by 
approximately  one-half  second (18 TR periods,  and longer than typical 
respiratory  events)  ( Nieman  et al., 2009 ). 
The second sequence  implemented  was a 3D version  of the 
MP2RAGE  pulse sequence  ( Marques  et al., 2010 ), which was also eval- 
uated in mice after manganese  injection.  An adiabatic  14-ms hyperbolic  
secant pulse was used for inversion.  Magnetization  readout  was accom-  
plished  by a FLASH sequence  with parameters  (TR = 13 ms, TE = 6 ms, 
𝛼1 / 𝛼2 = 7°/9°, with one phase-encode  acquired  per TR). After each in- 
version  pulse (spaced  4.2 s apart), two blocks of 65 excitations  each were 
separated  by a delay of 500 ms. The scan was repeated  four times, with 
two averages  and two shifted k-space  acquisitions  that enabled  collec- 
tion of four nominal  inversion  times (245, 661, 1590 and 2010 ms). To- 
tal scan time was 113 min, achieving  nominal  resolution  of 86 𝜇m. From 
the acquired  k-space,  images were reconstructed  and used to generate  a 
map of relaxation  rate (R1) by nonlinear  ﬁtting using optimization  tools 
in the SciPy library ( Virtanen  et al., 2020 ) and based on simulation  us- 
ing the parameters/timing  of the prescribed  sequence  (similar  to stan- 
dard Look-Locker  ﬁtting procedures  ( Crawley  and Henkelman,  1988 ; 
Gowland  and Mansﬁeld,  1993 )). The second and fourth images were 
used to generate  MP2RAGE  UNI images for visualization.

of factors including  age, sex, and psychiatric  disorders  (for review see 
Kong et al., 2020 ). Accurately  quantifying  these variations  across pop- 
ulations,  may shed a light on the complex  relationship  between  brain 
asymmetries  and behavior.  
Brain asymmetries  are typically  calculated  by dividing  the diﬀerence  
between  the left and right measures  (e.g., volume)  of a region by their 
sum: AI = (Left-Right  Measure)  / (Left + Right Measure),  with the mea- 
sure corresponding  to volume,  mean thickness,  or surface area (e.g., 
Galaburda  et al., 1987 ; Kong et al., 2020 ; F. Kurth et al., 2018 ). Al- 
though studies on brain asymmetry  generally  do not explain  why they 
divide l -R by L + R (e.g., Guadalupe  et al., 2017 ; X.-Z. Kong et al., 2018 ; 
Leonard  et al., 1993 ; Zuo et al., 2019 ), some suggest  that the denomina-  
tor at least partially  controls  for head size (e.g., Galaburda  et al., 1987 ; 
Steinmetz  et al., 1989 ) or that it “ensures  that the index does not simply 
scale with brain size ”( Kong et al., 2020 ). This adjustment  is similar to 
the proportion  method,  a method  used to adjust for diﬀerences  in brain 
size that divides  a regional  measure  (e.g., hippocampal  volume)  by a To- 
tal Cerebral  Measure  (TCM; e.g., Total Brain Volume  (TBV)).  However,  
instead  of removing  the eﬀect of brain size on the local measure,  studies 
have shown that the proportion  approach  often inverts the eﬀect of brain 
size because  it assumes  that the intercept  of the relationship  between  a 
local measure  and brain size is null and that the relationship  is linear 1 
( Lefebvre  et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2014 ; Sanchez-Roige  et al., 2019 ). Since 
the intercept  is generally  not null, dividing  by the global measure  can 
lead to reporting  inaccurate  group diﬀerences  ( Reardon  et al., 2016 ; 
Sanchis-Segura  et al., 2019 ; Williams  et al., 2021a , 2021b ). To take this 
issue into account,  recent studies adjust for brain size by using the co- 
variate approach,  which includes  the global measure  as a covariate  in 
the linear regression  models.  This raises the question  of whether  bilat- 
eral ( L + R ) measures  and/or global brain size should also be considered  
as covariates  when examining  group diﬀerences  in asymmetry.  
Furthermore,  the covariate  approach,  like the proportion  method,  as- 
sumes that the relationship  between  a local and a global measure  is lin- 
ear, while a growing  literature  suggests  that the relationships  between  
global and local cerebral  measures  are non-linear  ( Finlay et al., 2001 ; 
Fish et al., 2017 ; Reardon  et al., 2016 ; P.K. 2018 ; Toro et al., 2009 ). 
Thus, ignoring  non-linearities  in the brain could additionally  lead to re- 
porting  inaccurate  group diﬀerences.  
Finally,  global brain asymmetry  may also inﬂuence  local brain asym- 
metries.  Although  global brain asymmetries  have been investigated  
across studies linking neuroanatomy  to cognition  and mental health dis- 
orders, the relationship  between  the global and local AI remains  unclear.  
As global brain asymmetries  may partly explain  local asymmetries,  omit- 
ting the l -R TCM could inﬂuence  reported  group diﬀerences  in asym- 
metries.  
In the present  paper, we aimed to identify  the brain measures  that 
should be taken into account  by studies examining  group diﬀerences  in 
cerebral  asymmetries.  We ﬁrst examined  whether  the L + R Measure,  
TCM, and l -R TCM signiﬁcantly  predicted  regional  asymmetries.  We 
then investigated  whether  the relationship  between  the regional  AI and 
the L + R Measure,  global brain size, and the l -R TCM were non-linear.  
Thirdly,  since the two sexes diﬀer in brain size, we used the case of sex 
diﬀerences  in brain asymmetries  to illustrate  the consequences  of not 
taking these adjustments  into account.  Finally,  we reported  the eﬀects 
of sex, age, and their interactions  when including  all necessary  brain 
covariates  to report group diﬀerences  in asymmetries  that do not scale 
with brain size. 
1 Consider  Left (L) and Right (R) measures  for a given region. L is regressed  
on R, with a > 0: L = aR + b (error term removed  for simplicity).  If L and R are 
correlated  and a < 1 then l -R = (a-1)R + b will be negatively  correlated  with R 
and dividing  by L + R will not remove this correlation:  AI = (L-R)/(L  + R) = ((a- 
1)R + b)/((a + 1)R + b). Therefore,  the nature of the relationship  with R depends  
on the values of a and b. Since the AI is correlated  with R in most cases, it will 
also be correlated  with L + R. 2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
We included  UK Biobank  participants  that completed  a Magnetic  
Resonance  Imaging  (MRI) (N ≃41,000).  In brief, the UK Biobank  is 
an open-access  large prospective  study with phenotypic,  genotypic,  
and neuroimaging  data that includes  500 000 participants  recruited  
between  2006 and 2011 at 40 to 69 years old in Great Britain 
( Sudlow  et al., 2015 ). All participants  provided  informed  consent  ( “Re- 
sources  tab ”at https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/ﬁeld.cgi?id  = 200 ). 
The UK Biobank  received  ethical approval  from the Research  Ethics 
Committee  (reference  11/NW/0382)  and the present  study was con- 
ducted under application  46 007. 
The neuroimaging  phenotypes  in this study correspond  to volumes,  
mean thicknesses,  surface areas from the ﬁrst imaging  visit (Instance  
2) and were generated  by an image-processing  pipeline  developed  and 
run by the UK Biobank  Imaging  team ( Alfaro-Almagro  et al., 2018 ; 
Miller et al., 2016 ). 
2.1.1. Brain image acquisition  and processing  
A standard  Siemens  Skyra 3T running  VD13A  SP4 with a standard  
Siemens  32-channel  RF receive  head coil was used to collect data ( Brain 
Scan Protocol  ). The 3D MPRAGE  T1-weighted  volumes  were analyzed  
by the UK Biobank  Imaging  team with pipeline  scripts that primarily  
call for FSL and Freesurfer  tools. Details of the acquisition  protocols,  
image processing  pipeline,  image data ﬁles, and derived  measures  of 
brain structure  and function  are available  in the UK Biobank  Imaging  
Protocols  . 
2.1.2. Total brain volume (TBV) 
TBV was calculated  as the sum of the following  ASEG segmentation:  
Cerebellum  GMV (Left: 26,557,  Right: 26,588),  Cerebral  GMV (Left: 
26,552,  Right: 26,583),  Cerebellum  WMV (Left: 26,556,  Right: 26,587),  
Cerebral  WMV (Left: 26,553,  Right: 26,584),  and the total subcortical  
volume  we calculated  with the ASEG and Freesurfer  subﬁelds.  Refer to 
Supplemental  Section  1 for details on the choice of TBV. We excluded  
individuals  with missing  data in these regions,  yielding  40 055 partici-  
pants.

Weidner,  2022 ). Thus, it can be assumed  that Illusory  Contour  modu- 
lations reﬂect an iterative  (or resonant)  feedback  process  between  LOC 
and early visual cortex (e.g., V1) ( Shpaner,  Murray,  and Foxe, 2009 ). 
Across a series of studies by our research  group, we have noted sub- 
stantial  inter-individual  variability  in the timing and robustness  of VEP- 
derived  Illusory  Contour  modulations,  but the functional  signiﬁcance  of 
these feedback-related  diﬀerences  has not been explored  to our knowl- 
edge. However,  in related work in clinical  populations,  it has been noted 
that delays in the onset of these processes  are observed  in young adults 
with schizophrenia  ( Kemner  et al., 2009 ), raising the possibility  that 
delays in feedback  processing  have functional  implications  that may be 
related to well-established  visual sensory  processing  deﬁcits  in this pop- 
ulation ( Foxe, Doniger,  and Javitt, 2001 , Foxe, Yeap, and Leavitt,  2013 , 
Lalor et al., 2008 , Yeap et al., 2008 , Yeap et al., 2006 , Yeap et al., 2008 ). 
Here, we set out to establish  whether  the strength  and timing of visual 
feedback  processing  during an Illusory  Contour  integration  task would 
relate to variability  in task performance  and reﬂect the robustness  of 
visual sensory-perceptual  functioning.  
To this end, an excellent  tool in the hands of vision researchers  
for determining  timing eﬀects on visual processing  is the so-called  
backward-masking  paradigm  ( Baxt, 1871 , Imber, Shapley,  and Rubin, 
2005 , Fahrenfort,  Scholte,  and Lamme,  2007 ). In this paradigm,  pre- 
sentation  of a stimulus  to be acted upon (hereafter  referred  to as 
the “target ”), is rapidly  followed  by presentation  of a second “mask- 
ing ” stimulus  (the “mask ”) that is intended  to interfere  with process-  
ing of the target. When the interval  between  target and mask is suﬃ- 
ciently rapid, perceptual  discrimination  of relevant  features  of the target 
can be fully extinguished  ( Sekuler,  1965 , Sekuler,  1965 , Raab, 1963 ). 
There is substantial  inter-individual  variability  in susceptibility  to back- 
ward masking  ( Dember  and Neiberg,  1966 ), suggesting  that there is 
variability  in either the speed or the robustness  of visual processing.  
A reasonable  proposition  is that those who show least susceptibility  
to backward  masking  may display  the fastest and most robust pro- 
cessing of the initial target, such that by the time that neural sig- 
nals associated  with the mask are coursing  through  the visual system,  
suﬃcient  target processing  has already  occurred  to support  the ﬁnal 
perception.  
More speciﬁcally,  in the case of contour-integration,  one might ex- 
pect that those who show the earliest  or most robust feedback  pro- 
cessing signatures  would be those with most resilience  to the mask. 
The notion that backward  masking  can interfere  with feedback  pro- 
cessing was beautifully  illustrated  in a study in non-human  primates  
by Lamme  and colleagues,  who studied  ﬁgure-ground  detection  under 
backward  masking  conditions  ( Lamme,  Zipser, and Spekreijse,  2002 ). 
In a considerable  body of work, this research  group showed  that 
ﬁgure-ground  segregation  processes  emerge  in recordings  of V1 neu- 
rons at about 80-100 ms following  stimulus  delivery,  which is sub- 
stantially  later than the initial aﬀerent  input to V1 ( Zipser, Lamme,  
and Schiller,  1996 , Lamme  and Spekreijse,  2000 ), highly reminiscent  
of the illusory-contour  eﬀects reported  in human studies ( Foxe, Mur- 
ray, and Javitt, 2005 , Murray  et al., 2002 ). In turn, these contextual  
modulations  were selectively  attenuated  by anesthesia  ( Lamme,  Zipser, 
and Spekreijse,  1998 ) consistent  with the notion that they arose from 
feedback  inputs from higher-order  visual regions  ( Lamme  and Roelf- 
sema, 2000 ). In their 2002 study ( Lamme,  Zipser, and Spekreijse,  2002 ), 
Lamme  and colleagues  recorded  the activity  of V1 neurons  in awake 
behaving  macaques  who were tasked with indicating  when they de- 
tected ﬁgures from background.  They showed  that at relevant  target- 
to-mask  intervals,  suppression  of the characteristic  feedback  ﬁgure- 
ground  modulations  was clearly related to failure to discriminate  the 
ﬁgures.  
In a highly relevant  study in human observers,  the same research  
group recorded  VEP data during a ﬁgure-ground  discrimination  task 
where they presented  target stimuli containing  ﬁgures and those con- 
taining no-ﬁgures  while participants  were required  to simply indicate  
whether  there was a ﬁgure present  or not ( Fahrenfort,  Scholte,  and Lamme,  2007 ). In a no-mask  condition,  performance  was near perfect 
and a clear and characteristic  series of VEP modulations  was evident  
beginning  at about 110-140  ms and again between  200-300  ms, which 
were taken to reﬂect re-entrant  (feedback)  processing,  consistent  with 
their prior work in non-human  primates.  It is notable  that these modu- 
lations in response  to ﬁgure-ground  stimulus  conﬁgurations  are highly 
similar to those observed  to Illusory  Contour  ( Kanisza,  1976 ) ﬁgures.  In 
a second condition,  the same target stimuli were followed  immediately  
(i.e. no delay) by a highly eﬀective  masking  stimulus  and performance  
dropped  to chance for all participants.  Examining  the VEP records,  it 
became  clear that the initial sensory  VEP response  was unaﬀected  by 
the mask, whereas  the biphasic  ﬁgure-induced  modulations  that began 
at 110 ms were completely  absent. The authors  reasonably  concluded  
that the masking  stimuli had speciﬁcally  disrupted  feedback  processing  
and that this was why their participants  could no longer discriminate  
ﬁgure-ground  targets.  
Following  the logic of these Lamme  studies,  here we asked if the tim- 
ing and robustness  of feedback  Illusory  Contour  processing,  as measured  
using high-density  electrophysiological  mapping  of the VEP, would be 
associated  with resistance  to the eﬀects that backward  masking  has on 
perceptual  performance  in human observers.  In an initial psychophys-  
ical experiment,  we assessed  participants’  abilities  to recognize  the 
presence  or absence  of Illusory  Contour  targets at various  target-to-  
mask intervals,  thereby  stratifying  our participants  into four perfor- 
mance groups:  ( Doniger  et al., 2000 ) below average,  ( Foxe, Murray,  
and Javitt, 2005 ) low average,  ( Murray  et al., 2004 ) high average,  and 
( Murray  et al., 2002 ) superior  performers.  In a separate  electrophysi-  
ological  experiment,  we measured  the neural response  to the presence  
versus absence  of Illusory  Contours  in the same participants,  for un- 
masked  stimuli.  A clear relationship  between  the robustness  of the early 
Illusory  Contour-related  VEP modulation  and resistance  to the eﬀects of 
rapid backward  masking  emerged,  whether  considering  performance  as 
a continuous  variable  or by performance  group. These ﬁndings  suggest  
that individual  participant  variance  in the strength  of cortical  feedback  
during basic visual processing  has tangible  consequences  for everyday  
perceptual  function.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
40 participants  (age 18-33 years (mean ± SD = 21 ± 3 years)) were 
recruited  to this study, and included  19 females  and 21 males. All self- 
reported  normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision, normal  hearing,  and no 
history of neurologic  disorder.  Visual acuity was not explicitly  tested. 
However,  those participants  who did not report normal  uncorrected  vi- 
sion (i.e. those who wore glasses),  were ﬁtted with low-reﬂection  eye- 
tracker compatible  lenses from a set of interchangeable  correction  lenses 
(range of correction  + 2 diopters  to + 7 diopters  in 1 
2 diopter  increments),  
such that they reported  being able to clearly discern  the sharp borders  
of the Kanizsa  ﬁgures.  All experimental  procedures  were approved  by 
the institutional  review board of the University  of Rochester  Medical  
Center.  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants,  
and they were modestly  compensated  for their time in the laboratory  
($15/hour).

2.1. Sample 
Participants  included  children  and adolescents  aged 8 to 16 who 
were recruited  through  elementary  and secondary  schools  as part of the 
Brock Healthy  Youth Project (BHYP).  Parents  identiﬁed  whether  their 
child had any illnesses  or disabilities  (either physical  or mental).  Two 
participants  were excluded  because  of a diagnosis  of autism,  one partic- 
ipant was excluded  because  of a history of seizures,  and one participant  
was excluded  because  of a diagnosis  of cerebral  palsy. The ﬁnal sample 
included  467 participants  who were recruited  for the ﬁrst wave of data 
collection  and completed  the EEG session.  Participants  were excluded  
from the analyses  due to recording  issues with or excessive  artifact  iden- 
tiﬁed during pre-processing  ( n = 33 for GO trials, n = 30 NOGO trials). 
Additional  participants  were removed  due to extreme  values for theta 
power ( n = 2 for GO trials, n = 5 for NOGO trials). The ﬁnal sample re- 
sulted in 432 participants  (224 females,  208 males - See Supplementary  
materials  for a summary  of main ﬁndings  for males and females).

to characterize  epileptic  activity  of the brain and identify  appropriate  
resection  regions  with suﬃcient  accuracy  to proceed  with surgery.  
The SOZ is often identiﬁed  with the help of intracranial  measure-  
ment of electric  potential  during a seizure.  Electrocorticography  (ECoG)  
( Jayakar  et al., 2016 ) records  electrical  activity  from the cerebral  cor- 
tex using electrodes  placed directly  on the exposed  surface of the brain 
( Fig. 1 a), whereas  stereoelectroencephalography  (SEEG) ( Minotti  et al., 
2018 ) enables  exploration  of deeply located  structures  using needle-like  
depth electrodes  inserted  inside the brain ( Fig. 1 b). Implantation  of elec- 
trodes is an invasive  procedure  and therefore  applied  rarely, as the mea- 
surements  by these electrodes  do not directly  yield the location  of the 
seizure onset zone with accuracy  comparable  to imaging  resolutions,  
but rather form an input to further analysis.  Source modeling  is one 
way to process  that information  and combine  it with other imaging  in- 
formation  and prior assumptions.  To increase  the utilization  of epilepsy  
surgery  there is a pressing  need for new and more eﬀective  methods  of 
SOZ localization  that will enable clinicians  to cure epilepsy  in a greater 
number  of patients.  As it is estimated  that 20 million  people globally  
have focal epilepsy  that can be permanently  cured by precisely  targeted  
surgery  ( Organization,  2019 ), methods  for successful  identiﬁcation  of 
the SOZ would be of enormous  health beneﬁt.  One such promising  tech- 
nology is source localization  from invasive  measurements.  Using a vol- 
ume conductor  model of a patient’s  head as the basis for an inverse  
problem,  source localization  maps individual  electrode  measurements  
to three dimensional  maps of distribution  of electric  potential  within 
the brain. These maps have the potential  to signiﬁcantly  improve  SOZ 
identiﬁcation  by improved  analysis  of invasive  iEEG data. 
Accurate  and robust patient-speciﬁc  models of brain bioelectric  ac- 
tivity could have applications  well beyond  guiding  surgical  treatment  of 
epilepsy.  These include  the analysis  of extracranial  measurement  data, 
such as standard  electroencephalogram  (EEG) and magnetoencephalo-  
gram (MEG) often used in neurology,  neuroscience  and neuropsychia-  
try ( Brette and Destexhe,  2012 ), as well as generation  of high-quality  
synthetic  training  data for artiﬁcial  intelligence  (AI) systems  based on 
neural networks.  This last possible  application  is becoming  particularly  
important,  as in recent years, deep learning  has started to gain popular-  
ity for bioelectric  signal processing  ( Cendes and McDonald,  2022; Liu 
et al., 2021; Sun and Sclabassi,  2000; Tobore et al., 2019 ). With a large 
amount  of data, it outperforms  traditional  feature extraction  in terms 
of classiﬁcation  accuracy  ( Hu et al., 2019 ). Deep learning  algorithms,  
especially  the convolutional  neural network  (CNN), are also gradually  
being adopted  in epilepsy  management,  for example  for seizure detec- 
tion ( Gao et al., 2020; Thomas  et al., 2018 ). 
Source localization  based on ECoG or iEEG can be split into two sep- 
arate problems:  the iEEG forward  problem  that involves  calculating  the 
electric  potential  within the brain volume  given a predeﬁned  source (or 
multiple  sources);  and the iEEG inverse  problem  that involves  ﬁnding  
the source location  (or locations)  given electric  potential  measurements  
at the sensor electrodes  ( Baillet et al., 2001; Brette and Destexhe,  2012; 
Grech et al., 2008; Hallez et al., 2007 ). In addition  to considerations  speciﬁc  to the iEEG inverse  problem,  such as selection  of the number  of 
sources  and the choice of source localization  algorithms  ( Bradley  et al., 
2016; Grech et al., 2008; Scherg et al., 2019 ), source localization  re- 
quires an accurate  solution  of the iEEG forward  problem,  which depends  
on an accurate  representation  of the geometry  of the patient’s  brain and 
electrical  conductivity  distribution  within the patients  head ( Brette and 
Destexhe,  2012; Hallez et al., 2007; Vorwerk  et al., 2014; Wolters  et al., 
2006 ). 
This study is based on the realization  that a patient’s  brain is signiﬁ- 
cantly deformed  by the implantation  of the electrodes  ( Fig. 1 ). The shift 
in the brain surface caused by implantation  of ECoG grid electrodes  is 
typically  on the order of around 5 mm, but often exceeds  10 mm ( Foldes 
et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2000 ). Consequently,  models built from preoper-  
ative images that do not account  for this brain shift will be geometrically  
very inaccurate.  To remedy  this situation,  we demonstrate  how to con- 
struct a volume  conductor  model corresponding  to the true deformed  
brain geometry  and how to solve quickly  the iEEG forward  problem  —
a prerequisite  for the iEEG inverse  problem  that ultimately  needs to be 
solved to localize  sources.  
In some previous  studies,  to account  for craniotomy  induced  brain 
shift during placement  of grid electrodes,  the electrode  positions  iden- 
tiﬁed from the postoperative  CT were projected  onto the cortical  sur- 
face extracted  from the preoperative  MRI ( Dykstra  et al., 2012; Hermes  
et al., 2010; LaViolette  et al., 2011; Taimouri  et al., 2014; Tao et al., 
2009; Yang et al., 2012 ). Although  this approach  solves the issue of 
the electrodes  being erroneously  located  within the brain tissue instead  
of on the surface of the brain, it does not accurately  reﬂect the actual 
postoperative  conﬁguration  of the brain. In the current  study, instead  
of projecting  the electrode  positions  onto the undeformed  preoperative  
cortical  surface,  we aim to predict the postoperative  conﬁguration  of 
the brain such that the cortical  surface of the model used for solving  
the iEEG forward  problem  corresponds  to the actual position  of the im- 
planted  surface electrode  array. 
In this paper, we propose  a novel modeling  pipeline  for iEEG source 
localization  that incorporates  the tissue deformation  caused by the cran- 
iotomy and placement  of the electrodes.  Using preoperative  MR and 
postoperative  CT images,  our approach  employs  biomechanics-based  
image warping  to predict the postoperative  conﬁguration  of the brain 
(i.e., the conﬁguration  deformed  by the implantation  of intracranial  
electrodes).  The postoperative  CT is used to locate the electrode  posi- 
tions and to inform the boundary  conditions  and loading  of the biome- 
chanical  model. The approach  taken in this study is to register  the pre- 
operative  anatomical  MRI and DTI onto the postoperative  CT (with elec- 
trodes implanted)  using a displacement  ﬁeld computed  by a biomechani-  
cal model ( Miller et al., 2019a; Mostayed  et al., 2013; Safdar et al., 2021; 
Wittek and Miller, 2020; Wittek et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2022 ) to obtain 
the warped  MRI and DTI corresponding  to the postoperative,  deformed  
conﬁguration  of the patient’s  brain. Based on these warped  images,  we 
construct  a geometrically  correct computational  domain  on which the 
partial diﬀerential  equations  of the iEEG forward  problem  are solved, as 
2  B.F. Zwick, G.C. Bourantas,  S. Safdar et al. NeuroImage  263 (2022) 119649 
well as an inhomogeneous  and anisotropic  patient-speciﬁc  distribution  
of the conductivity  tensor used in the solution  procedure.  
This paper describes  a comprehensive  pipeline  for the patient-  
speciﬁc  solution  of the iEEG forward  problem  based on our suite of 
meshless  algorithms  for accurate  computation  of soft tissue deforma-  
tion ( Joldes et al., 2019 ). In our previous  study ( Joldes et al., 2019 ), we 
warped  the scalar MRI to demonstrate  the image warping  capability  of 
our suite of meshless  algorithms,  and to demonstrate  its potential  ap- 
plicability  to the iEEG forward  problem.  In the current  study, the key 
use of the computed  displacements  is to warp the DTI to obtain a more 
realistic  geometric  domain  on which to solve the iEEG forward  problem.  
Previously  ( Joldes et al., 2019 ), we used B-spline  interpolants  for image 
warping  whereas  in the current  study we use an improved  image warp- 
ing method  using the same moving  least squares  (MLS) interpolants  as 
those used to compute  the displacements  in our meshless  biomechanical  
model. Many of the steps required  to generate  the biomechanical  model 
for image warping  have been automated;  notably  the skull stripping  of 
the MR image, the selection  of loaded nodes under the ECoG electrode  
grid, the projection  of electrode  positions  onto the original  undeformed  
brain surface,  and the generation  of the computational  grid. Finally,  in 
this study we combine  the information  from the warped  DTI and un- 
warped  MRI and CT to create a conductivity  map of the head (with 
brain geometry  deformed  by insertion  of electrodes)  for the iEEG for- 
ward problem,  and solve this problem  using the ﬁnite element  method  
on a regular  hexahedral  grid with elements  corresponding  to the voxels 
of the predicted  deformed  image. 
Continuum  models based on partial diﬀerential  equations  are the 
dominant  method  for brain bioelectric  activity  modeling  at the spatial 
and temporal  scales accessible  via EEG, iEEG, ECoG and MEG. Numer-  
ical solution  of these equations  have attracted  considerable  attention  
in the literature.  Mainstream  numerical  methods,  such as ﬁnite ele- 
ment (FEM) ( Drechsler  et al., 2009; Marin et al., 1998; Medani  et al., 
2021; Pursiainen  et al., 2011; Schimpf  et al., 2002; Schrader  et al., 
2021 ), ﬁnite volume  (FVM) ( Cook and Koles, 2006 ), ﬁnite diﬀerence  
(FDM) ( Bourantas  et al., 2020; Hyde et al., 2012; Saleheen  and Ng, 
1997; Wendel  et al., 2008 ) and boundary  element  methods  (BEM) ( Acar 
and Makeig,  2010; Meijs et al., 1989; Stenroos  and Sarvas, 2012 ), as 
well as newer, more sophisticated  methods  such as meshless  methods  
( Fiétier et al., 2013 ) that use a point cloud to represent  the spatial do- 
main, have been used to numerically  solve the governing  equations  of 
the EEG forward  problem.  
The ﬁnite element  method  (FEM) achieves  high numerical  accuracy  
( Drechsler  et al., 2009; Vorwerk  et al., 2012; 2018 ) and can be eas- 
ily used to model complex  geometries  having anisotropic  conductivities  
( Gullmar  et al., 2006; Güllmar  et al., 2010; Haueisen  et al., 2002; Rull- 
mann et al., 2009; Vorwerk  et al., 2014; Wolters  et al., 2006 ). The FEM 
uses a tessellation  of the computational  domain  in which the domain  
is partitioned  into a set of elements  of simple shape, such as tetrahe-  
drons or hexahedrons.  Tetrahedral  meshes  are usually  generated  by con- 
strained  Delaunay  tetrahedralization  from segmented  and reconstructed  
tissue surface representations  ( Vorwerk  et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, 
regular  hexahedral  meshes  can be easily generated  from voxel-based  
raw image data ( Rullmann  et al., 2009; Schimpf  et al., 2002; Vorw- 
erk et al., 2017 ). This greatly simpliﬁes  mesh generation,  which is an 
important  consideration  for ensuring  compatibility  with clinical  work- 
ﬂows. Moreover,  regular  hexahedra  have favourable  numerical  prop- 
erties over skewed  hexahedra  or tetrahedra  ( Hughes,  2000 ). Geometry-  
adapted  hexahedra  ( Wolters  et al., 2007a ) or tetrahedra  ( Vorwerk  et al., 
2017 ) may give similar results using less elements,  but this comes at the 
signiﬁcant  cost of additional  complications  of mesh generation.  
Our methodology  is an embodiment  of the “image-as-a-model  ”con- 
cept ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) as it is entirely  voxel-based  and the ﬁnite el- 
ement method  with a mesh coinciding  with the voxel structure  of the 
image is used to obtain the solution.  Advantages  of this voxel-based  
analysis  include  straight-forward  generation  of realistic  patient-speciﬁc  
models from three-dimensional  image data, and a simple data structure  that is suitable  for storage,  handling,  numerical  solution  and visualiza-  
tion ( Rullmann  et al., 2009; Schimpf  et al., 1998; 2002 ). 
To demonstrate  the application  of the proposed  methodology  and to 
quantify  the eﬀect of geometric  accuracy  on the iEEG forward  problem  
solutions,  we solve two example  problems  using the original  preoper-  
ative geometry  (with both the actual and the projected  electrode  posi- 
tions) and the geometry  after model based image deformation.  In the 
ﬁrst example,  we apply a current  dipole inside the brain and compare  
the potential  computed  at the electrodes.  In the second example,  we 
compute  the lead ﬁeld matrices  (gain matrices  relating  the source space 
with the measurement  space which are often used in the solution  of the 
iEEG inverse  problem)  using the models constructed  from the original  
and deformed  image data, and compare  the diﬀerence  between  the two 
sets of results.  In both examples,  the large diﬀerence  in the results ob- 
tained using the original  and deformed  image data suggest  that the iEEG 
forward  problem  solution  accuracy  may be improved  by accounting  for 
electrode  placement  induced  brain shift in the patient-speciﬁc  volume  
conductor  model as described  herein, which, when combined  with suit- 
able inverse  solution  methods,  may lead to improved  accuracy  in source 
localization.  
The paper is organized  as follows.  In Section  2 , we describe  the 
mathematical  model, patient-speciﬁc  model construction  and the com- 
ponents  of the numerical  methodology.  In Section  3 , we provide  patient-  
speciﬁc  numerical  results conﬁrming  robustness  and eﬃciency  of our 
modeling  and simulation  pipeline,  as well as demonstrating  inaccura-  
cies of using models built directly  from preoperative,  undeformed  im- 
ages. Section  4 contains  discussion  and conclusions.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Governing  equations  of the brain bioelectric  activity at scales as 
measured  by iEEG and MRI 
The intracranial  electroencephalography  (iEEG) forward  problem  in- 
volves predicting  the electric  potential  within the brain and at the im- 
planted  electrodes  given a predeﬁned  source. The relevant  frequency  
spectrum  in iEEG is typically  below 1 kHz, with most studies dealing  
with frequencies  between  0.1 and 100 Hz ( Baillet et al., 2001; Brette 
and Destexhe,  2012 ). Therefore,  the physics  of iEEG can be approxi-  
mated by Poisson’s  equation,  which is the quasi-static  approximation  
of Maxwell’s  equations.  For a spatial domain  Ω∈ℝ 3 with boundary  
𝜕Ω= Γ𝐷 ∪Γ𝑁 and outward  unit normal  𝒏 , Poisson’s  equation  for the 
iEEG forward  problem  can be written  as follows:  
−∇ ⋅( 𝐶(∇ 𝑢 )) = 𝑓 in Ω, (1) 
𝒏 ⋅( 𝐶(∇ 𝑢 )) = 𝑔 on Γ𝑁 , (2) 
𝑢 = ℎ on Γ𝐷 , (3) 
where 𝑢 is the unknown  scalar potential  and 𝐶is the (symmetric  positive  
semi-deﬁnite)  conductivity  tensor. The low conductivity  of air outside  
the scalp ( 𝐶 = 0 for all 𝑥 ∉̄Ω) implies  that a zero-ﬂux  Neumann  bound- 
ary condition  𝑔 = 0 can be applied  on the surface Γ𝑁 . Dirichlet  boundary  
conditions  ℎ on the surface Γ𝐷 are typically  applied  by setting the poten- 
tial to zero at a node corresponding  to a reference  electrode.  Loading  can 
be applied  to the model either by prescribing  the potential  𝑢 at certain 
nodes or by applying  a current  source 𝑓 = ∇ ⋅𝒋 , with 𝒋 being a dipole 
source vector. The epileptic  seizure onset source is typically  modeled  as 
a current  dipole ( Hallez et al., 2007 ). 
Electromagnetic  source localization  employs  a linear model, known 
as the lead ﬁeld matrix,  which relates the measured  electrode  voltages  
to the cerebral  current  sources  that generated  them ( Rush and Driscoll,  
1969; Weinstein  et al., 2000 ). The lead ﬁeld matrix can be computed  
using Helmholtz’s  principle  of reciprocity,  which relates the potential  
3  B.F. Zwick, G.C. Bourantas,  S. Safdar et al. NeuroImage  263 (2022) 119649 
diﬀerence  between  two points 𝐴 and 𝐵caused by a given dipole 𝒑 , to 
the electric  ﬁeld 𝑬 = −∇ 𝑢 at the dipole location  resulting  from a current  
𝐼placed between  𝐴 and 𝐵( Plonsey,  1963; Weinstein  et al., 2000 ): 
𝑬 ⋅𝒑 
− 𝐼 = 𝑢 𝐴 − 𝑢 𝐵 . (4) 
The lead ﬁeld matrix can be constructed  by placing  a source and sink at 
pairs of electrodes,  and computing  for each of these pairs the resulting  
electric  ﬁeld in all of the elements.  The reciprocity  principle  can then 
be applied  to reconstruct  the potential  diﬀerences  at the electrodes  for 
a source placed in any element  ( Weinstein  et al., 2000 ). 
Computation  of the lead ﬁeld matrix requires  the solution  of the for- 
ward problem  for each sensor and ground  electrode  pair. To compute  the 
lead ﬁeld matrix,  one electrode  is selected  arbitrarily  as the ground  (or 
reference)  electrode.  For each lead ﬁeld (row in the lead ﬁeld matrix),  
a unit current  is applied  to one of the sensor (non-ground)  electrodes.  
The electric  ﬁeld in each element  is computed  as the gradient  of the 
electric  potential  and represents  a row in the matrix.  The potential  at 
the ( 𝑀 − 1) non-ground  electrodes  for a source located  in any of the 𝑁
elements  is given by 
𝒖 = 𝑳 𝒋 , (5) 
where 𝑳 , of dimension  ( 𝑀 − 1) ×3 𝑁, is the lead ﬁeld matrix,  and 𝒋 , of 
dimension  3 𝑁 ×1 , is a vector of dipole amplitudes  in all points of the 
source space. 
Although  the iEEG forward  problem  is linear, it is diﬃcult  to solve 
due to signiﬁcant  diﬃculties  in creating  a patient-speciﬁc  domain  Ω
on which the Eqs. (1) –(3) are to be solved and patient-speciﬁc  spatial 
distribution  of anisotropic  conductivity  tensor 𝐶, addressed  below. 
2.2. Patient-speciﬁc  model generation  
In this section,  we describe  the methods  used to create a detailed  
patient-speciﬁc  model for the iEEG forward  problem.  Accurate  solution  
of the iEEG forward  problem  requires  a correspondingly  accurate  rep- 
resentation  of both the computational  domain  ( Ωin Eq. (1) ) and the 
tissue conductivity  ( 𝐶in Eq. (1) ) throughout  the conducting  head vol- 
ume. The head volume  is bounded  by the rigid skull and scalp, which 
can be easily extracted  from the preoperative  images.  The brain, how- 
ever, is a soft tissue that deforms  due to the insertion  of the electrode  
grid array. To take into account  the brain shift following  electrode  in- 
sertion,  we apply our biomechanics-based  image warping  techniques  to 
predict the postoperative  brain geometry.  
Fig. 2 provides  a ﬂowchart  of the proposed  methodology.  
A detailed  description  of each step is provided  in the following  sub- 
sections.  To facilitate  the adoption  of the proposed  methodology  we 
have developed  the SlicerCBM  (Computational  Biophysics  for Medicine  
in 3D Slicer) software  extension  for the 3D Slicer medical  imaging  
platform  ( Fedorov  et al., 2012 ). The SlicerCBM  extension  is made 
freely available  under the BSD open-source  license and can be down- 
loaded from our GitHub  repository  ( https://github.com/SlicerCBM/  
SlicerCBM  ). We have implemented  each of the steps described  below 
as separate  modules  that can be used independently  or as a complete

located  directly  on the scalp, with a standoﬀof  ∼5 mm to the sensing  
cell. This increases  signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR) and sensitivity  to higher 
magnetic  ﬁeld spatial frequencies  ( Boto et al., 2017 ; Iivanainen  et al., 
2021 ; Luessi et al., 2014 ; Riaz et al., 2017 ). 
The current  generation  of commercially  available  OPM sensors  em- 
ploys a transparent  heated vapor cell containing  an alkali-metal  vapor 
such as 87 Rb to detect the magnetic  ﬁeld. They are designed  to oper- 
ate in zero ﬁeld under the spin-exchange  relaxation-free  (SERF) con- 
dition ( Happer  and Tang, 1973 ; Kim et al., 2014 ). The atoms in the 
vapor are spin-polarized  using a pump laser tuned to the D1 spectral  
absorption  line. The optical transparency  of the vapor is a measure  of 
the local magnetic  ﬁeld and is monitored  by an internal  photodetector  
( Dupont-Roc  et al., 1969 ; Shah et al., 2007 ). The SERF OPM response  to 
ﬁeld change has the shape of an absorptive  Lorentzian  centered  around 
zero magnetic  ﬁeld. Modulation  and lock-in detection  linearizes  the dis- 
persion  curve in the vicinity  of zero ﬁeld and establishes  the sensing  
axis ( Allred et al., 2002 ; Dupont-Roc  et al., 1969 ). Given that the sen- 
sor response  is nonlinear  outside  a relatively  narrow  range ( ± 2 nT), 
OPMs must be operated  in a low ﬁeld environment  such as a magnet-  
ically shielded  room (MSR) ( Cohen, 1967 ). The static ﬁeld within our 
typical commercial  MSR is 30-40 nT with gradients  of ∼10 nT/m and 
low-frequency  ﬂuctuations  are typically  ∼1-2 nT peak-to-peak.  To en- 
sure that the sensors  are within the linear operating  range, in open- 
loop operation  the ﬁeld within individual  OPM sensors  is nulled before 
measurement  by means of three orthogonal  sets of ﬁeld coils surround-  
ing the vapor cell. Because  this static nulling process  cannot correct for 
dynamic  changes  in ﬁeld, due either to environmental  ﬂuctuations  or 
movement  of the array in the ambient  ﬁeld, additional  solutions  must 
be sought.  The ambient  magnetic  ﬁeld surrounding  an OPM MEG sen- 
sor array can be reduced  further using three orthogonal  large ﬁeld coils 
surrounding  the subject’s  head ( Iivanainen  et al., 2019 ) or using a set 
of multilayer  biplanar  coils (MuCoils,  Magnetic  Shields Ltd, Kent, UK) 
to control ﬁelds and gradients  without  restricting  subject access. The 
biplanar  coils compensate  three magnetic  ﬁeld and three of ﬁve ﬁrst 
gradient  ( Holmes  et al., 2019 ) components  to yield a ± 5% ﬁeld homo- 
geneity  within a 40 ×40 ×40 cm 3 volume  enclosing  the subject’s  head, 
reducing  the ﬁeld to within ± 2 nT ( Holmes  et al., 2018 ; Holmes  et al., 
2019 ; Mellor et al., 2022 ; Mellor et al., 2021 ). While dynamic  con- 
trol of the MuCoils  is possible  ( Hill et al., 2022 ; Holmes  et al., 2019 ; 
Mellor et al., 2022 ), the remnant  ﬁeld combined  with subject movement  
may nonetheless  introduce  ﬁelds exceeding  the linear range of sensors  
operating  in default open-loop  mode. In addition  to linearity  errors in- 
duced by large ﬁeld oﬀsets, it has recently  been reported  that additional  
measurement  errors are induced  by small transverse  ambient  ﬁeld oﬀ- 
sets that perturb  the sensing  axis ( Cohen-Tannoudji  et al., 1970 ); this 
phenomenon  has been referred  to as cross-axis  projection  error (CAPE)  
( Borna et al., 2021 ). CAPE introduces  both phase errors and a tilt of the 
sensing  axis. At low frequencies  this axis tilt is approximately",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5181, 5184), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(3816, 3820), match='  3.'>"

subjects  ( Wager et al., 2013 ). Because  many (if not all) of these brain 
regions  involved  multiple  brain functions,  one remaining  critical ques- 
tion is how these diﬀerent  regions  and networks  causally  interconnect  
and integrate  painful information.  To answer this question,  it is essen- 
tial to be able to directly  perturb  (stimulate,  inhibit or shut down) ac- 
tivity at speciﬁc  nociceptive  processing  brain regions  while monitoring  
the changes  in the networks.  Ethical and technical  concerns  constrain  
such studies in humans.  Nonhuman  primates  (NHP) provide  alterna-  
tive models for such studies aiming to dissect networks  and identify  
key hubs because  cortical  and subcortical  regions  are determined  by 
multifaced  features  such as cytoarchitectonic  features,  anatomical  con- 
nections,  and neuronal  activity  properties.  In animal models,  invasive  
recording  and stimulation  methods  can be combined  and used to achieve  
high precision  network  perturbation  ( Gerits et al., 2012 ; Klink et al., 
2021 ; Xu et al., 2019 ; Yang et al., 2021 ). Supporting  this notion, our 
previous  work in NHPs demonstrated  that many core brain regions  in- 
volved in human pain perception  remained  active during processing  of 
heat nociceptive  stimulation  under light anesthesia  ( Wu et al., 2017 ). 
Moreover,  reﬁned subnetworks  are not readily distinguishable  in the 
human brain, likely due to the low resolution  of human fMRI studies,  
the proximity  between  regions,  and lack of detailed  anatomically  vali- 
dated atlas. For example,  at the lateral sulcus region (the equivalent  of 
the Sylvian  ﬁssure in the human brain), multiple  areas reside (e.g., S2, 
posterior  insula (pIns), and area 7b) in close proximity  that are believed  
to represent  the nature and/or magnitude  of pain sensation  ( Isnard et al., 
2011 ; Kim et al., 2017 ; Segerdahl  et al., 2015 ) and have shown robust 
nociceptive  heat stimulation  related fMRI responses.  S2 and posterior  in- 
sula are not readily distinguishable  in the human brain ( Sawamoto  et al., 
2000 ). Moreover,  we have identiﬁed  sub-modality  (cold, heat, and me- 
chanical)  nociceptive  responsive  regions  that are organized  as separated  
patches  and in distinct  patterns  ( Chen et al., 2011 , 2012 ; Wu et al., 2017 ; 
Yang et al., 2018 ). These meso ‑scale patch-like  organizations  have not 
been reported  in the human brain. This patch-like  organization  is func- 
tionally  relevant  because  our subsequent  intracranial  electrophysiology  
mapping  and recordings  identiﬁed  clustered  nociceptive  heat neurons  
at one S2 region that showed  robust fMRI signal changes  to nociceptive  
heat stimulation  ( Ye et al., 2021 ). To date, to our knowledge,  this is the 
ﬁrst line of evidence  supporting  that fMRI signal changes  indeed reﬂect 
the neural activity  of nociceptive  neurons  ( Chen et al., 2011 ; Yang et al., 
2018 ; Ye et al., 2021 ) at a millimeter  scale. Using these functionally  
identiﬁed  S2 and pIns as seed regions,  we found that these two key 
regions  connect  to two non-overlapping  cortical  networks  ( Wu et al., 
2017 ). These resting-state  functional  connectivity  (rsFC) networks  are 
surrogates  of intrinsic  nociceptive  networks  because  rsFC measured  with 
resting state fMRI (rsfMRI)  signals reﬂects  neuronal  functional  connec-  
tivity ( Chen et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2013 ; Wilson et al., 2016 ), for a 
review see Chen et al. (2017 ). 
Building  upon our and others’ previous  work, here we aimed to map 
and delineate  cortical  and subcortical  nociceptive  sub-networks  at the 
whole brain level by applying  both seed-based  and data-driven  clus- 
tering and graph theory analysis  of rsfMRI signals.  We also explored  
whether  the temporal  dynamics  have a signature  feature of each net- 
work and characterize  the networks’  temporal  dynamic  features.  Specif- 
ically, we addressed  the following  questions:  what is the hierarchical  
functional  organization  of brain regions  that are involved  in nocicep-  
tive information  processing?  How are nociceptive  sub-networks  inter- 
connected  and through  which hubs? Does each sub-network  exhibit its 
own distinct  dynamic  functional  connectivity  features?  The ﬁndings  de- 
rived from the present  study will help to establish  the fundamental  net- 
work organization  principles  of the primate  pain system,  and, there- 
fore, could also inform the construction  of pain-speciﬁc  mathematical  
network  models for guiding  rsFC analysis  in human pain fMRI studies.  
Moreover,  identiﬁcation  of key hubs will guide future direct stimula-  
tion studies that aim to dissect the whole brain pain circuits  and un- 
derstand  the causal connections  and information  processing  ﬂow in the 
primate  brain. By combining  heat nociceptive  stimulation  and resting-  state fMRI, we identiﬁed  six nociceptive  sub-networks  and hubs inter- 
connecting  them. 
2. Methods  and materials  
2.1. Animal preparation  
Three adult male squirrel  monkeys  ( Saimiri sciureus  ) (SM-H, SM-G, 
and SM-S) were studied.  Data from four imaging  sessions  were included  
in the quantiﬁcation  (one animal underwent  two sessions).  For the fMRI 
experiments,  animals  were initially  sedated  with ketamine  hydrochlo-  
ride (10 mg/kg,  im) and given atropine  sulfate (0.05 mg/kg,  im), and 
then anesthetized  with isoﬂurane  (0.7% − 1.2%) delivered  in a 70:30 
N 2 O/O 2 mixture.  After intubation,  the animal was placed in a custom-  
designed  MR cradle with the head secured  in a plastic stereotaxic  frame 
with two plastic ear bars and one head bar. During fMRI data acqui- 
sition, animals  were maintained  at a light (0.7–0.9%  isoﬂurane)  and 
stable level of anesthesia.  2.5% dextrose  in saline solution  was infused  
intravenously  (3 ml/kg/h)  to prevent  dehydration.  Animals  were artiﬁ- 
cially ventilated  to maintain  an end-tidal  CO 2 of 4%. Rectal temperature  
was maintained  (SA Instruments)  between  37.5 °C and 38.5 °C using a 
circulating  water blanket.  Heart rate (EKG, SA instruments),  peripheral  
capillary  oxygen  saturation  (SpO 2 ; Nonin),  respiration  pattern,  and end- 
tidal CO 2 (22–26 mmHg;  SurgiVet)  were continuously  monitored  during 
the entire procedure.  During fMRI data acquisition,  the heart rate was 
stable, with changes  of ⟨10 bpm during stimulation.  SpO 2 was also sta- 
ble, remaining  at ⟩95% during the entire experiment.  All procedures  
were conducted  by following  National  Institutes  of Health and ARRIVE  
guidelines  and were approved  by the Institutional  Animal  Care and Use 
Committee  of Vanderbilt  University.  
2.2. Stimulation  protocol  
The subjects’  ﬁngers were stabilized  with modeling  clay, palm side 
up, leaving  the glabrous  skin of the distal ﬁnger pads available  for stim- 
ulation.  Noxious  heat (47.5 °C) stimuli were presented  on the distal and 
middle phalanges  of D2 and D3 of the dominant  hand simultaneously  
(right hands in all monkeys)  via a CHEPS thermal  probe with a rapid 
heating  rate of 70 °C/s (Medoc  Advanced  Medical  Systems).  For a typ- 
ical fMRI noxious  heat (47.5 °C) stimulation  run, 21 s duration  blocks 
of 47.5 °C heat were repeated  nine times with a 30 s baseline  (32 °C) 
period in between.

(SST + ) 𝛾-aminobutyric  acid (GABA)  interneurons  ( Alherz et al., 2017 ). 
Based on the foundational  hypotheses  on the generation  of fast cor- 
tical oscillations  (cf. Buzsaki  and Wang, 2012 ; Traub et al., 1996 ; 
Whittington  and Traub, 2003 ), the micro-circuital  interplay  of the re- 
spective  interneurons  with glutamatergic  pyramidal  cells produce  said 
frequency  oscillations  ( Lisman  et al., 2008 ). Further,  impaired  genera-  
tion of gamma  oscillations  due to NMDAR  knockout  on PV + interneu-  
rons can be linked to cognitive  deﬁcits  in mouse models ( Carlen et al., 
2012 ). 
The auditory  evoked  gamma-band  response  (aeGBR)  is among the 
sensory  evoked  GBOs which have been of special interest,  given that 
they do not only reﬂect sensory  processes  but appear to be aﬀected  by 
attention  and memory  ( Cho et al., 2006 ; Herrmann  et al., 2010 ). The 
aeGBR appears  25 to 100 ms after an auditory  stimulus  and exempli-  
ﬁes the top-down  operations  in sensory  processing,  as its magnitude  is 
profoundly  altered by task diﬃculty  ( Mulert et al., 2007 ). Several  stud- 
ies have proven that aeGBRs  are impaired  in all stages of schizophre-  
nia ( Leicht et al., 2015 , 2010 ), high risk subjects  ( Leicht et al., 2016 ), 
and even ﬁrst-degree  relatives  of people with the illness ( Leicht et al., 
2011 ). It is noteworthy,  that these detriments  are accompanied  by a 
reduced  activity  of a network  including  the anterior  cingulate  cortex 
(ACC) ( Leicht et al., 2015 ), which has repeatedly  been implicated  in 
the pathophysiology  of schizophrenia  and its cognitive  dysfunctions  
( Reid et al., 2019 ; Takayanagi  et al., 2017 ). 
The ketamine  model of schizophrenia  oﬀers the opportunity  to 
study this illness without  having to test patients.  It utilizes  the ad- 
ministration  of subanesthetic  doses of the NMDAR  antagonist  ketamine  
(or its eutomer  S-Ketamine)  to reduce NMDAR  dependent  glutamater-  
gic neurotransmission,  which causes the emergence  of schizophrenia-  
like positive,  negative,  and cognitive  symptoms  in healthy  volunteers  
( Krystal et al., 1994 ) or aggravating  symptom  severity  in patients  
( Lahti et al., 1995 ). This model particularly  depicts aberrant  GBOs since 
under physiological  conditions  ketamine  demonstrates  the highest  aﬃn- 
ity for the NMDARs  expressing  GluN2C  and GluN2D  subunits,  which 
are most frequently  expressed  on the aforementioned  PV + and SST + 
GABAergic  interneurons  ( Khlestova  et al., 2016 ; Kotermanski  and John- 
son, 2009 ). The inhibition  of the respective  interneurons  is supposed  to 
result in a disruption  of the local microcircuits  ( Lisman  et al., 2008 ) 
and leads to an impaired  generation  of GBO resembling  deﬁciencies  ob- 
served in patients  with schizophrenia  ( Jadi et al., 2016 ). 
Glycine  binds to an allosteric  binding  site of the NMDAR,  thus en- 
abling signal transduction  following  the engagement  of glutamate  as 
well as promoting  and enhancing  the binding  of glutamate  to the NM- 
DAR ( Leeson and Iversen,  1994 ). These characteristics  allow glycine  
to attenuate  neurophysiological  impairments  in patients  suﬀering  from 
schizophrenia  ( Greenwood  et al., 2018 ; Kantrowitz  et al., 2018 ) and 
neurophysiological  impairments  related to (induced)  NMDAR  hypofunc-  
tion as animal studies have proven ( Lee et al., 2018 ). 
Based on the strong interplay  of schizophrenia  symptoms,  NMDAR  
dysfunction  and receptor  co-agonists,  this study aimed to delineate  
the impact of an exogenously  induced  NMDAR  dysfunction  on the 
generation  of the aeGBR and the eﬀect of glycine  thereon.  This was 
achieved  by means of a cognitively  demanding  auditory  choice reac- 
tion task after a pretreatment  with glycine  and during the continuous  
infusion  of S-ketamine.  We hypothesized  that glycine-pretreatment  mit- 
igates the disturbances  of the aeGBR and the interrelated  emergence  
of schizophrenia-like  symptoms  during S-ketamine  administration  in 
healthy  volunteers.

Twenty-six  healthy  male participants  were enrolled  in this study. 
The general  procedure  was approved  by the Ethics Committee  of the 
Medical  Association  Hamburg  and carried out in accordance  with the latest version  of the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Written  informed  consent  
was obtained  from all participants  after the nature of the procedures  had 
been fully explained.  One participant  dropped  out due to adverse  eﬀects 
caused by S-ketamine  (dissociative  eﬀect/headache).  Another  partici-  
pant had to be excluded  due to poor EEG data quality.  Accordingly,  we 
included  24 healthy  male participants  in EEG data analysis.  Volunteers  
were either students  or medical  staﬀ of the University  Medical  Center 
Hamburg  and received  a monetary  compensation  for the EEG recording  
sessions.

portion  incorrect  = 0.913, Z = − 0.128, p = 0.898, eﬀect size = − 0.029, 
Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing).  There was also no signiﬁcant  eﬀect 
of stimulus  feature on choice accuracy  ( Fig. 2 b, High-Pitch  Tone: pro- 
portion  correct = 0.914; Low-Pitch  Tone: proportion  correct = 0.917, 
Z = − 0.237, p = 0.812, eﬀect size = − 0.053, Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  
Testing).  
We found no signiﬁcant  eﬀect of associative  congruency  on me- 
dian RTs for visual stimuli (Supplementary  Figure 1b, Congruent:  me- 
dian = 581 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset; Incongruent:  median  = 604 ms post- 
stimulus  oﬀset; Z = − 1.161, p = 0.245, eﬀect size = − 0.260, Wilcoxon  
Signed-Rank  Testing).  We further found no signiﬁcant  eﬀect of visual 
stimulus  feature on median  RTs (Supplementary  Figure 1a, Small-Size  
Circle: median  = 597 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset; Large-Size  Circle: me- 
dian = 586 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset, Z = − 0.863, p = 0.388, eﬀect 
size = − 0.193, Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing).  
Regarding  choice accuracy,  participants  had a slightly,  but not signif- 
icantly,  higher proportion  of correct responses  for trials with congruent  
compared  to incongruent  visual stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  
(Supplementary  Figure 1d, Congruent:  proportion  correct = 0.957; In- 
congruent:  proportion  correct = 0.955, Z = − 0.055, p -value = 0.956, 
eﬀect size = − 0.012. Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing).  There was also no 
signiﬁcant  eﬀect of visual stimulus  feature on choice accuracy  (Supple-  
mentary  Fig. 1c, Small-Size  Circle: proportion  correct = 0.954; Large- 
Size Circle: proportion  correct = 0.958; Z = − 1.161, p -value = 0.245, 
eﬀect-size  = − 0.260, Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing).  
To summarize,  we found responses  for congruent  auditory  trials 
were faster than responses  for incongruent  auditory  trials and, in ad- 
dition, within the set of congruent  trials, correct responses  were slower 
than incorrect  responses.  Furthermore,  we found responses  for congru-  
ent visual trials were not faster nor more accurate  compared  to in- 
congruent  visual trials. Therefore,  no signiﬁcant  behavioural  improve-  
ments as a result of associative  congruency  were demonstrated  when 
categorising  visual stimulus  features  (see Supplementary  materials  for 
Figs. 1 and 2 for the behavioural  and modelling  results for visual stimuli 
respectively).  EEG signal analysis  results 
Next, we analysed  the EEG data to identify  the neural components  
that discriminated  between  congruent  and incongruent  trials. Speciﬁ-  
cally, for each participant  separately,  we performed  a single-trial  mul- 
tivariate  discriminant  analysis  to identify  linear spatial weightings  (i.e. 
spatial ﬁlters) of the EEG sensors  that discriminated  congruent  from in- 
congruent  trials. The identiﬁed  weightings  produced  a projection  in the 
128-dimensional  EEG space that maximally  discriminated  congruent-vs-  
incongruent  trials within short pre-deﬁned  windows  of 50 ms, locked to 
stimulus  onset. 
Application  of the resulting  linear spatial ﬁlters to single-trial  EEG 
data produces  a measurement  quantifying  the discriminating  compo-  
nent amplitude  ( y , see Methods  and materials  ). These component  ampli- 
tudes can be used as an index of the quality of categorizing  the congru-  
ency of stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  in each trial. In other 
words, higher amplitudes,  negative  or positive,  indicate  higher neural 
evidence  for congruent  or incongruent  stimulus  feature-response  key 
mappings,  while values closer to zero indicate  less evidence  of catego-  
rizing associative  congruency.  
To quantify  the discriminator’s  performance  over time, we used the 
area under a receiver  operating  characteristic  curve (i.e. A z value), cou- 
pled with a leave-one-trial-out  cross validation  approach,  to control for 
overﬁtting.  Compared  to traditional  approaches,  which assume  an A z 
value of 0.5 as chance performance,  we performed  a permutation  anal- 
ysis using a leave-one-trial-out  procedure  that produced  an A z random-  
ization distribution,  to compute  a group-average  A z value, that lead to 
a conventional  signiﬁcance  level of p = 0.05. 
Our discriminator’s  performance  as a function  of stimulus-locked  
time revealed  increased  discriminant  performance  from 0 to 600 ms, 
above the signiﬁcance  level estimated  from our permutation  test. Specif- 
ically, discriminator  performance  within this range was characterized  
by two temporally  speciﬁc  components  ( Fig. 3 a; C Early : mean peak 
time = 100–110  ms, Az value = 0.846; C Late : mean peak time = 330–
340 ms, Az value = 0.797).  These components  were consistent  across 
participants  (see Fig. 4 a for the A z curves and Fig. 4 b for the maximum  
A z values of each participant).  We then computed  the corresponding

Glucose  consumption,  as measured  in the living human brain 
with 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose  ( 18 F-FDG)  Positron  Emission  Tomography  
(PET), diﬀers across brain regions,  presumably  based on their molecu-  
lar (e.g., receptor  density),  structural  (e.g., number  or type of neurons),  
and functional  properties  (e.g., connectivity,  patterns  of neuronal  activ- 
ity) ( Clarke and Sokoloﬀ,  1999 ). However,  the combination  of factors 
controlling  this variability  across the brain is currently  unknown.  
We know that the regional  heterogeneity  of glucose  metabolism  cor- 
relates with local activity,  measured  as the amplitude  of the blood oxy- 
genation  level-dependent  (BOLD)  signal or the BOLD signal synchro-  
nization  in neighboring  voxels ( Tomasi  et al., 2013 ; Aiello et al., 2015 ). 
There is also a somehow  weaker  linear relationship  between  regional  
metabolism  and the degree of functional  interaction  with other brain 
regions  measured  through  the pairwise  inter-regional  temporal  correla-  
tion, a.k.a. functional  connectivity  (FC), both at rest ( Aiello et al., 2015 ; 
Nugent  et al., 2015 ) and during a visual task ( Riedl et al., 2014 ). No- 
tably, the strength  of FC in one region correlates  with regional  cerebral  
blood ﬂow (rCBF),  with stronger  coupling  in more densely  function-  
ally connected  regions  (hubs), especially  in association  cortex as com- 
pared to visual or sensory-motor  regions  ( Liang et al., 2013 ). However,  
other studies have reported  either a scaling law relationship  between  
glucose  metabolism  and FC ( Tomasi  et al., 2013 ), or topographic  diﬀer- 
ences between  regions  with linear vs. non-linear  relationships  ( Shokri-  
Kojori et al.. 2019 ). 
Given these premises,  in this study we re-examine  the question  of 
the variability  of glucose  metabolism  across the brain, and its rela- 
tionship  with so-called  RSNs. RSNs deﬁne groups of regions  that show 
synchronous  ﬂuctuations  of their spontaneous  activity  measured  with 
BOLD-fMRI,  and the whole cerebral  cortex, as well as subcortical  nuclei 
and cerebellum,  can be divided  in a ﬁnite number  of RSNs ( Biswal et al., 
1995 ; Fox and Raichle,  2007 ; Doucet et al., 2011 ; Yeo et al., 2011 ; 
Power et al., 2011 ; Yeo et al., 2011 ). Hence, it is plausible  that some RSN 
features,  insofar as they reﬂect an organizational  principle  of metabol-  
ically demanding  spontaneous  activity,  may explain  the variability  of 
glucose  consumption  across the brain. 
First, we asked to what extent RSN topography  matches  regional  
variations  in glucose  metabolism.  Data-driven  analyses  have sepa- 
rated “extrinsic  ”(sensory-motor,  task-positive)  vs. “intrinsic  ”networks  
(higher  cognitive,  task-negative),  which may diﬀer in many struc- 
tural and functional  properties,  including  metabolism  ( Fox et al., 2005 ; 
Doucet et al., 2011 ; Margulies  et al., 2016 ; Glasser  et al., 2016 ). 
Secondly,  using graph metrics,  which allow for a compact  descrip-  
tion of FC matrices  at the region level, we systematically  examined  
the relationship  between  regional  glucose  metabolism  and FC prop- 
erties, both local and global, across the whole-brain  and in single 
RSNs. 
Finally,  we focused  on the relation  between  glucose  metabolism  and 
the centrality  of a region in a network:  by varying  the region’s  centrality  
(hubness),  we explored  the interaction  of metabolism  with a region’s  
position  within the brain network,  and whether  hubs connecting  regions  
within the same or between  diﬀerent  networks  have similar/diﬀerent  
metabolism.  
To enhance  statistical  power and spatial accuracy  of the group-level  
descriptions  of both regional  metabolism  and FC, we combined  two pri- 
orly published  datasets  of 18 F-FDG PET and fMRI resting-state  data, si- 
multaneously  acquired  on the same hybrid PET-MR  system ( Aiello et al., 
2015 ; Riedl et al., 2014 ). The data were analyzed  at the level of cortical  
parcels based on a high-resolution  functional  atlas ( Gordon  et al., 2016 ) 
and subcortical  parcels deﬁned  according  to anatomical  segmentation.  
As a measure  of regional  glucose  metabolism,  we used the relative  stan- 
dard uptake value (SUVR),  a semi-quantitative  index of 18 F-FDG tracer 
uptake.  While a fully quantitative  approach  that separates  the inﬂow of 
the 18 F-FDG tracer into the region from its phosphorylation  within the 
cell would be ideal ( Clarke and Sokoloﬀ,  1999 ), this limitation  is com- 
mon to all published  studies ( Tomasi  et al., 2013 ; Aiello et al., 2015 ; 
Riedl et al., 2014 ; Shokri-Kojori  et al., 2019 ). 2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Data and imaging  protocols  
The dataset includes  28 healthy  subjects  from two studies:  11 sub- 
jects (8 males; 52.2 ± 10.4 years) from ( Riedl et al., 2014 ) (hereby  re- 
ferred as dataset A - Munich),  and 17 subjects  (6 males; 64.7 ± 7.9 years) 
from ( Aiello et al., 2015 ) (hereby  referred  as dataset B - Naples).  Nine 
subjects  from the original  publication  by Aiello et al. (2015) were ex- 
cluded during processing  as functional  and/or structural  images were 
corrupted  by motion.  
The subjects,  with no previous  psychiatric  or neurological  history,  
provided  their informed  written  consent  according  to the Code of Ethics 
of the World Medical  Association  and the Institutional  Review  Board and 
Ethics Committee  at the Technische  Universität  München,  for dataset A 
( Riedl et al., 2014 ), and the SDN Foundation,  for dataset B ( Aiello et al., 
2015 ). 
Both datasets  simultaneously  collected  18 F-FDG PET and fMRI data 
accompanied  by a structural  image on two identical  Biograph  mMR 3T 
scanners  (Siemens  Healthcare,  Erlangen,  Germany)  equipped  with the 
standard  head-neck  coil (12-channel).  The subjects  were lying in the 
scanner  with their eyes open without  performing  any task. 
Dataset A: The MRI dataset included  a structural  magnetiza-  
tion prepared  rapid acquisition  gradient  echo (MPRAGE)  T1w image 
(TR/TE  = 2300/2.98  ms, FA = 9°, 1 mm isotropic  voxel size), and 300 vol 
(total scan time of 10 min and 8 s) of resting-state  fMRI T2 ∗ gradient-  
echo echo planar imaging  (GE-EPI,  TR/TE = 2000/30  ms and voxel size 
3 ×3 ×3 mm, 0.6 mm inter slice gap). PET images obtained  in a satu- 
rated list mode (10 min duration),  started 30 min post injection  (recon-  
struction  voxel size of 1.04 ×1.04 ×2.03 mm, see ( Riedl et al. 2014 ) for 
more details).  
Dataset B : The MRI dataset consisted  of a similar T1w MPRAGE  struc- 
tural image, and 240 vol (total scan time of 7 min and 40 s) of resting-  
state fMRI GE-EPI (TR/TE  = 1920/32  ms, and voxel size 4 ×4 ×4 mm). 
PET imaging  started 30 min post injection  and lasted 15 min (recon-  
struction  voxel size of 1.12 ×1.12 ×2.03 mm, see ( Aiello et al., 2015 ) for 
more details).  
2.2. Data pre-processing  
All subjects  were identically  pre-processed  to obtain local 
metabolism  information  from 18 F-FDG PET data, as well as func- 
tional connectivity  (FC) from resting state-fMRI  data employing  a 
processing  pipeline  similar to Glasser  et al. (2013) . 
2.2.1. Structural  image pre-processing  
Structural  T1w images were bias ﬁeld corrected  ( Tustison  et al., 
2010 ), skull stripped  ( Tustison  et al., 2013 ), and segmented  into gray 
matter,  white matter,  and cerebrospinal  ﬂuid using the Advanced  Nor- 
malization  Tools ( ANTs , Avants et al., 2011 ). 
The brain cortex was delineated  with Freesurfer  ( Fischl et al., 1999 ) 
obtaining  pial and gray-white  matter surfaces.  Manual  editing was per- 
formed  to correct for surface delineation  errors. 
As in Glasser  et al. (2013) , the generated  surfaces  were resampled  
over the fs_LR mesh provided  by the Conte69  atlas (symmetric  hemi- 
sphere mesh of 32k nodes) to obtain aligned  cortical  surfaces  for each 
subject.  
The Gordon  functional  atlas ( Gordon  et al., 2016 ) (GL atlas) was 
used to parcel cortical  surfaces  into 333 regions  supplemented  by 18 
subcortical  regions  delineated  by Freesurfer  (bilaterally:  caudate,  puta- 
men, accumbens,  pallidum,  amygdala,  hippocampus,  thalamus,  ventral 
diencephalon,  cerebellum  cortex).  
2.2.2. Functional  image pre-processing  
The ﬁrst four fMRI volumes  were discarded  to avoid non-equilibrium  
magnetization  eﬀects. The remaining  volumes  were corrected  for slice 
2  A. Palombit,  E. Silvestri, T. Volpi et al. NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119280 
timing diﬀerences  ( Smith et al., 2004 ) and realigned  to the median  vol- 
ume using FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ). A template  EPI volume  was 
obtained  from realigned  fMRI data using ANTs and used to estimate  
an aﬃne transform  (with FSL ) employed  to map main tissue segmen-  
tations obtained  from the pre-processed  T1w image to the native EPI 
space. 
Nuisance  signals,  including  motion parameters  (rotations,  transla-  
tion) and their ﬁrst order derivatives,  and the ﬁrst ﬁve temporal  princi- 
pal components  obtained  after principal  component  analysis  of WM and 
CSF EPI signals as in ( Behzadi  et al. (2007) , were regressed  out from all 
brain voxels in native EPI space. Regression  residuals  were resampled  
ﬁrst in the native T1w space and then on the mid-thickness  cortical  sur- 
face using FSL and Connectome  Workbench  ( Marcus  et al., 2011 ). Finally,  
the BOLD signal was high pass ﬁltered  with a cut-oﬀ of  0.008 Hz. No 
low-pass  ﬁlter was employed,  as BOLD signal frequencies  higher than 
0.1 Hz have been shown to provide  physiologically  and neurally  rele- 
vant information  ( Chen and Glover,  2015 ). 
Pre-processed  EPI signals were averaged  within each parcel to com- 
pute a representative  time course.

The study was conducted  according  to the Declaration  of Helsinki  
including  all current  revisions  and the good scientiﬁc  practice  guide- 
lines of the Medical  University  of Vienna.  The protocol  was approved  
by the institutional  review board (EK Nr.: 1739/2016)  and the study 
was registered  at clinicaltrials.gov  (NCT02753738).  2.1. Experimental  design 
The overall study followed  a randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-  
controlled  longitudinal  design. Three MRI examinations  with 21 days of 
(re-)learning  between  each session were conducted  (i.e., the MRIs were 
performed  on the 1 st , 22 nd and 43 rd day). For a subsample,  a test-retest  
scan was performed  21 days before the baseline,  to mitigate  the chance 
of misinterpreting  time- as learning-related  changes.  The subjects  were 
randomized  upon recruitment  to one of four groups learning  to match 
either Chinese  characters  to random  German  nouns or faces to faces and 
subsequently  relearn new associations  while receiving  placebo  or esci- 
talopram  ( Fig. 1 A). During the latter phase, the previous  associations  
(character-noun  / face-face)  were shuﬄed  and had to be relearned  fol-

daily oral dose of 10 mg escitalopram  (Cipralex;  Lundbeck  A/S, Copen- 
hagen, Denmark;  provided  by the pharmacy  of the Medical  University  
of Vienna)  or placebo.  To monitor  the proper intake, the escitalopram  
blood plasma levels were assessed  around day 7, 14 and 21 of the re- 
learning  phase. 
2.2. Learning  paradigm  
Throughout  the course of the study, the subjects  had to perform  an 
association-learning  task with emotional  (face pairs) or non-emotional  
(Chinese  characters  –G e r m a n  nouns) content.  In both cases they had 
to learn 200 pairs of images via a daily online training  at home (i.e., 
21 learning  and 21 relearning  sessions).  Each session contained  a pseu- 
dorandom  selection  of 52 image pairs (i.e., the same sequence  for all 
participants).  These were presented  sequentially  for 5 s each. After the 
training,  a pseudorandom  selection  of 52 images out of all previously  
seen had to be matched  to the correct counterpart  without  time limit. 
No feedback  was given to keep learning  and retrieval  strictly separated.  
All pseudorandomizations  were conducted  with replacement.  The sub- 
jects were given personal  credentials  for the online learning  platform  
and instructed  to complete  one session per day at approximately  the 
same time. In case sessions  were missed,  they could be done on the 
next day. However,  subjects  were excluded  in case of generally  irregular  
learning.  During each MRI session,  learning  and retrieval  tasks similar to 
those on the online platform  were performed  in the scanner  ( Reed et al., 
2021 ). In order to minimize  additional  inﬂuences  on neuroplastic-  
ity, subjects  were told not to travel during their participation  in the 
study.

is that it gates the perception  of sensory  input by inhibiting  sensory  pro- 
cessing when power is high ( Van Diepen et al., 2019 ). Across individ-  
uals, there is considerable  variability  in the alpha band frequency  (i.e. 
speed) from which the greatest  EEG power is recorded  ( Haegens  et al., 
2014 ). This frequency,  often labelled  the Peak Alpha Frequency  (PAF) or 
Individual  Alpha Frequency  (IAF), has been found to contribute  to indi- 
vidual diﬀerences  in multiple  psychological  and physiological  processes  
( Cecere et al., 2015 ; Haegens  et al., 2014 ; Ramsay  et al., 2021 ). 
Resting  alpha frequency  and its relationship  to pain sensitivity  
In our 2018 Neuroimage  paper, we found that PAF obtained  from 
healthy  individuals  during a pain-free  rest period was negatively  corre- 
lated with the degree of pain experienced  during an experimental  model 
of thermal  hyperalgesia.  Speciﬁcally,  we induced  pain in 21 healthy  par- 
ticipants  (mean age 28.4 years) using a 10% capsaicin  paste (topically  
applied,  not intradermally  as reported  by Valentini  et al.). Topical  cap- 
saicin exposure  induces  robust thermal  hyperalgesia,  a common  symp- 
tom in chronic  neuropathic  pain. We found that those who had a slower 
PAF in the pain-free  state one hour before pain induction  reported  more 
subsequent  pain than those who had faster PAF. 
We replicated  this ﬁnding  ( Furman  et al., 2020 ) in a pre-registered  
study (NCT02796625)  using a larger sample of participants  ( n = 61 (a 
larger sample than in Valentini  2022, despite their claim that they used 
“the largest sample size ( n = 36), ”mean  age 27 years) and found that 
PAF could predict sensitivity  to two models of prolonged  pain, even up 
to eight weeks later. We also replicated  this ﬁnding  (slower  PAF = higher 
pain sensitivity)  in a completely  diﬀerent  muscle pain model that in- 
duces pain lasting days to weeks ( Furman  et al., 2019 ). 
Most recently  we directly  investigated  if PAF can be used as a clin- 
ical tool to stratify pain-sensitive  patients  and found that pre-operative  
(pain-free)  PAF of patients  correlated  with pain severity  during the 72 h 
period after surgery  ( Millard  et al., 2022 ). These studies taken together  
support  the idea that PAF is a reliable  and robust biomarker  of an in- 
dividual’s  sensitivity  to pain and could serve to identify  patients  who 
are at risk for severe post-surgical  pain. The identiﬁcation  of these pa- 
tients would allow for pre-emptive  pain management  strategies  which 
could reduce patient suﬀering,  reliance  on post-operative  opioid use, 
and potentially  minimize  chronic  pain development.  In some cases, al- 
ternatives  to elective  surgeries  might be sought for patients  assessed  to 
be high risk for developing  chronic  post-surgical  pain. 
The important  distinctions  between  our work and Valentini  et al 
Simply put, Valentini  et al. mistakenly  assert that the basis of our 
claim of PAF being a reliable  biomarker  pertains  to PAF slowing,  rather 
than slow PAF. Indeed,  in Furman  2018, we demonstrated  these two 
things are independent.  
The investigation  by Valentini  et al., which also used healthy  partici-  
pants, focused  on PAF changes  (i.e. PAF slowing)  in response  to pain in- 
duced by hand immersion  into hot-water,  with ‘warm-water’  immersion  
as well as an unpleasant  (but not painful)  auditory  stimulus  presentation  
condition  serving  as control conditions.  They observed  that PAF slowed 
during the painful hot hand immersion  compared  with warm stimula-  
tion. However,  they did not observe  signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  between  the 
painful hot and unpleasant  auditory  conditions.  They interpreted  this as 
being contrary  to our previous  work by suggesting  a causal role of PAF 
in the generation  of acute pain experience  in healthy  individuals.  
We have never suggested  that PAF plays a causal role in the gen- 
eration of painful experiences.  Rather,  our data across multiple  experi- 
ments suggests  that slow PAF is a trait-like  marker  that is predictive  of 
individual  sensitivity  to acute pain, either induced  experimentally  or by 
surgery.  The causal versus predictor  distinction  here is crucial.  
As mentioned  earlier,  the alpha rhythm  is the predominant  rhythm  
of our sensory  cortices  and PAF has been shown to contribute  to in- 
dividual  diﬀerences  in multiple  psychological  and physiological  pro- cesses ( Cecere et al., 2015 ; Haegens  et al., 2014 ; Ramsay  et al., 2021 ; 
Torralba  Cuello et al., 2022 ). Moreover,  diverse  populations  have been 
found to show a slow alpha frequency,  including  school-aged  children  
born very premature  ( Doesburg  et al., 2011 ), people with schizophrenia  
(Ramsay,  2021 and elderly adults with earlier dementia  ( Garcés et al., 
2013 ). One view of alpha activity  is that each cycle reﬂects  a pulse of 
phasic inhibition  ( Haegens  et al., 2011 ; Van Diepen et al., 2019 ) which 
is capable  of inhibiting  incoming  sensory  information  (noxious  and in- 
nocuous).  Faster PAF could reﬂect a greater capacity  to modulate  sen- 
sory input. 
We would like to further note that factors that predispose  an individ-  
ual to high pain sensitivity  need themselves  not be speciﬁc  to pain; for 
example,  attention  –a fundamental  core cognitive  process  that enables  
us to selectively  focus on one aspect of our environment  while ignoring  
the other –has been repeatedly  shown to play an important  role in de- 
termining  pain susceptibility  ( Baum et al., 2011 ). While we feel that it is 
unlikely  that PAF is exclusively  tied to pain, both our work and ﬁndings  
of Valentini  et al. suggest  that its modulation  in response  to pain bears 
a relationship  to individual  pain sensitivity.  
Finally,  in addition  to the slow versus slowing  of PAF, there are some 
key distinct  methodological  diﬀerences  between  our investigations  and 
those of Valentini  et al. which need to be discussed  and scrutinized  to 
avoid ambiguity  in future research.  
The state of participants  when PAF was estimated  
Our investigations  have used ‘pain-free’,  eyes-closed  peak alpha fre- 
quency  as the predictor  of an individual’s  sensitivity  to induced  pain (ex- 
perimental  or surgical).  We reason that having participants  close their 
eyes increases  the amplitude  of the PAF, making  it easier to detect, and 
reducing  ocular artefacts  that can distort its estimation.  Valentini  et al. 
obtained  the participants’  eyes-open  PAF while they were experiencing  
pain. Obtaining  PAF during a pain state makes it very hard to assess it as 
a trait marker  for pain sensitivity.  In fact, our 2018 study failed to ﬁnd a 
systematic  slowing  of PAF after pain induction  across participants,  but 
rather the pain resulted  in speeding  of PAF in some participants  and 
a slowing  in others. Indeed,  other groups have reported  a lack of as- 
sociation  between  PAF slowing  and pain sensitivity  ( De Martino  et al., 
2021 ), suggesting  that while pain-free  PAF is a reliable  pain sensitiv-  
ity biomarker,  the association  between  the change in PAF speed during 
ongoing  pain and pain sensitivity  is more complex.  
The sensory  modality  of stimulation  
Valentini  et al. claim that their experiment  shed light on the func- 
tional signiﬁcance  of PAF with regards  to pain by including  a condition  
(an auditory  stimulus)  that while not painful is unpleasant.  While we 
believe  this to be an interesting  line of inquiry,  the choice of having the 
unpleasant  stimuli and painful stimuli being two diﬀerent  modalities  
does confound  this line of investigation.  Previous  research  has shown 
both the visual, auditory,  and somatosensory  cortex each have respec- 
tive alpha generators  (often with diﬀerent  PAF frequencies)  which are 
modulated  by perceptual  demands  ( Banerjee  et al., 2011 ; Haegens  et al., 
2011 ; Mazaheri  et al., 2014 ; Whitmarsh  et al., 2022 ).We speculate  that 
it is likely that even though the unpleasantness  of the sound and heat 
conditions  were matched,  being diﬀerent  sensory  modalities  meant that 
they were impacting  diﬀerent  alpha sources  (possibly  with diﬀerent  rest- 
ing PAFs). 
Nevertheless,  if non-painful  unpleasant  stimuli are found to modu- 
late individual  PAF similar to painful ones, it would suggest  the modu- 
lation of PAF reﬂects  a general  aversion  response.  This would be in line 
with previous  work has found a shared somatosensory  representation  
between  unpleasant  emotional  stimuli and somatic  pain ( Kross et al., 
2011 ) as well as the observation  that brain areas such as the mid- 
cingulate  cortex, thalamus,  amygdala,  and lateral orbital frontal cor- 
2  A. Mazaheri,  D.A. Seminowicz  and A.J. Furman NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119560 
tex encode a general  aversion  signal irrespective  of stimulus  modality  
( Čeko et al., 2022 ). 
Experimental  design to assess pain 
Valentini  et al. appear to implicitly  claim that their investigation  is 
more ‘reliable  and robust’ than previous  investigations  looking  at the 
relationship  between  PAF and pain perception.  They claim to employ  
a data-driven  cluster-analysis  approach  to spatially  select alpha oscil- 
lations at ‘rest and only rest’… “while  avoiding  selective  analysis  and 
double-dipping.  ”
We are unsure here if the authors  are (wrongly)  suggesting  that pre- 
vious investigations  looking  at the impact of pain on PAF have used the 
same data set for selection  and selective  analysis.  Nevertheless,  we sug- 
gest that the best way to reliably  and robustly  assess the relationship  of 
PAF with pain sensitivity  is to (1) Use diﬀerent  pain models within the 
same study (2) Include  test and re-test (3) Incorporate  cross-validation.  
We should note that all of these were employed  in our recent investiga-  
tion cited by the authors  ( Furman  et al., 2020 ). 
In conclusion,  PAF remains  a viable and promising  biomarker  of pain 
sensitivity  and in our opinion  the work by Valentini  et al. 2022 gen- 
erally supports  that literature.  We are encouraged  that multiple  labs 
( De Martino  et al., 2021 ; Fauchon  et al., 2021 ; McLain  et al., 2022 ; 
Seminowicz  et al., 2020 ) are now working  on this emerging  ﬁeld. In 
future studies,  we need to be precise about what we are measuring  and 
what we are predicting  before making  claims of refuting  others’ work.

Recent studies have used MNI space parcellations  ( Krauth et al., 
2010 ) to study the functional  roles of thalamic  nuclei. For instance,  
Geier et al., (2020) describe  how the mediodorsal  and anterior  tha- 
lamic nuclei contribute  in distinct  ways to associative  memory  pro- 
cesses, while Huang et al, (2019) show how diﬀerent  cognitive  de- 
mands produce  dissociable  modulatory  responses  in the mediodor-  
sal nucleus  and its functional  connectivity  with the prefrontal  cor- 
tex, while also demonstrating  that these dissociations  are aberrant  in 
schizophrenia.  In both studies,  MNI space thalamic  parcellations  cre- 
ated by Krauth et al, (2010) are derived  from the Morel stereotaxic  atlas 
( Morel, 2007 ; Morel et al., 1997 ). The Morel stereotaxic  atlas is a widely 
used atlas of the thalamus  derived  from cytoarchitecture,  myeloarchi-  
tecture,  and functional  relevance  –using immunohistochemical  staining  
of the calcium  binding  proteins  parvalbumin,  calbindin  D-28k, and cal- 
retinin –to identify  anatomical  boundaries  from ﬁve postmortem  brain 
specimens  ( Figure 1 ). The Morel atlas thus provides  a description  of the 
anatomical  structure  of the thalamus  that is not possible  to acquire  in 
vivo using magnetic  resonance.  Yet, the existence  of this atlas in MNI 
space does not allow neuroscientists  to infer subject-speciﬁc  architec-  
ture, as it is based on the average  of multiple  individuals.  
Numerous  methods  are described  in the neuroimaging  literature  for 
deﬁning  the anatomical  structure  of thalamic  nuclei using diﬀusion  
weighted,  resting state, and anatomical  data. Automated  segmentation  
techniques  ﬁrst appear just after the turn of the century  and include  
initial reports relying on anatomical  ( Amini et al., 2004 ; Deoni et al., 
2007 ), diﬀusion  data ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ; Johansen-Berg  et al., 2005 ; 
Wiegell  et al., 2003 ), and resting state functional  data ( Kim et al., 2013 ; 
Zhang et al., 2008 ). Parcellation  methods  have used prior knowledge  of 
distinct  cortico-thalamic  connectivity  to estimate  structural  boundaries  
within the thalamus  using tractography  ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ; Johansen-  
Berg et al., 2005 ), functional  connectivity  ( Zhang et al., 2008 ), and ma- 
chine learning  approaches  such as clustering  algorithms  ( Amini et al., 
2004 ; Deoni et al., 2007 ; Wiegell  et al., 2003 ) or independent  compo-  
nent analysis  ( Kim et al., 2013 ; Kumar et al., 2017 ). More recent ap- proaches  using anatomical,  diﬀusion,  and resting state data have been 
reviewed  by Iglehart  et al. (2020) . 
A recent, and alternative  approach  for using anatomical  data was 
developed  by Iglesias  et al. (2018) , and uses FreeSurfer  to provide  au- 
tomated  segmentations  of thalamic  nuclei. This approach  involves  the 
application  of a probabilistic  atlas to the anatomical  image in subject 
space, using Bayesian  inference  to reﬁne predicted  locations:  In this 
modelling  framework  prior knowledge  of brain anatomy  is combined  
with the likelihood  of a given voxel intensity  conditioned  on the proba- 
bility assignment  to a given label. This model is used to estimate  labels, 
which are progressively  reﬁned until a stable segmentation  is obtained.  
This probabilistic  atlas is in the form of a tetrahedral  mesh that can 
adapt to changes  in subject-speciﬁc  diﬀerences  in anatomy.  The mesh 
was formed  from a combination  of ex-vivo  MR images,  histological  stain- 
ing, blockface  photography,  and in-vivo MRI. This approach  may be 
preferable  relative  to techniques  using resting state and diﬀusion  data 
because  it is able to delineate  more nuclei with the thalamus,  and is eas- 
ier to apply. Additionally,  this approach  does not require  the acquisition  
of data using specialist  sequences,  such as WMn MP-RAGE,  meaning  it 
is applicable  to a wide range of existing  and future datasets.  
Having  good subject-speciﬁc  parcellation  techniques  for thalamic  
nuclei is important  for both clinical  practice  and empirical  research.  
For instance,  these techniques  could be used to guide surgeons  when im- 
planting  deep brain stimulation  electrodes  to treat Parkinson’s  disease  
( Whiting  et al., 2018 ). These techniques  can also be used by researchers  
who may be interested  in the role of diﬀerent  thalamic  nuclei in func- 
tional processes,  or the role of anatomical  diﬀerences  in health, develop-  
ment, and disease.  Nevertheless,  the eﬀectiveness  of segmentation  ap- 
proaches  must ﬁrst be validated  before inferences  can be made based on 
their output.  In their original  publication,  Iglesias  et al. (2018) provide  
volumetric  comparisons  between  six segmented  nuclei and their cor- 
responding  regions  in the Morel atlas for 66 participants,  yet these vol- 
umes are not statistically  compared  to each other, nor is the spatial speci- 
ﬁcity of segmentations  quantiﬁed.  Here, we aim to systematically  com- 
pare the segmentation  approach  described  by Iglesias  et al. (2018) with 
regions  in the Morel atlas. We provide  volumetric,  overlap,  and iso- 
metric comparisons  between  all segmented  regions  and portions  of 
the Morel atlas. These insights  will allow clinicians  and researchers  to 
make informed  decisions  about the applicability  of this segmentation  
approach  for identifying  speciﬁc  thalamic  nuclei in individuals.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Data acquisition  
Anatomical  data were sourced  from the publicly  available  dataset 
of the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 1200 Subjects  Data Re- 
lease under the HCP Open Access Data Use terms ( https://www.  
humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/1200-  
subjects-data-release  ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ). The following  description  
of data acquisition  and preprocessing  steps from the HCP project follow 
reporting  guidelines  from Horien et al. (2021) on the use of secondary  
neuroimaging  datasets.  
HCP data were acquired  using a custom  Siemens  3T Connectome  
Skyra scanner  with a 32 channel  receiver  head coil and custom  body 
transmission  coil. Data were acquired  over four separate  scanning  ses- 
sions; each session was approximately  one hour in length. The struc- 
tural data were acquired  during one of those sessions.  Two T1 weighted  
anatomical  images were acquired  using a 3D magnetization-prepared  
rapid gradient-echo  (MP-RAGE)  sequence  with GeneRalized  Autocali-  
brating  Partially  Parallel  Acquisitions  (GRAPPA)  (R = 2) [TR = 2400ms;  
TE = 2.14ms;  TI = 1000ms;  slices = 256; voxel volume  = 0.7mm 3 ; slice 
thickness  = 0.7mm;  distance  factor = 50%; slice oversampling  = 0.0%; 
FOV = 224 ×224mm;  matrix = 320 ×320; ﬂip angle = 8°; phase encod- 
ing direction  = A →P; interleaved  acquisition;  echo spacing  = 7.6ms].

2.2. Probabilistic  atlas generation  
The probabilistic  atlas of Iglesias  et al. (2018) was generated  us- 
ing data from 6 older adults post mortem  who had no history of dis- 
ease aﬀecting  brain morphology,  and in vivo data from 39 younger  
adults. Post mortem  brains were ﬁxed by perfusing  tissue in situ with 4% 
paraformaldehyde  in phosphate  buﬀer (pH 7.4); brains were then ex- 
tracted and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde  until ex vivo MRI scanning.  
Whole brain ex vivo images were acquired  using a spatial resolution  of 
0.25mm  isotropic  using a 3D multi-slab  balanced  steady-state  free pre- 
cession  sequence  ( McNab et al., 2009 ; see Iglesias  et al., 2018 for all 
acquisition  parameters).  Following  ex vivo imaging,  post mortem  tissue 
for the left and right hemispheres  were separately  sectioned  into blocks, 
and blocks containing  thalamic  tissue were immersed  in cryoprotectant.  
Tissue was cryosectioned  into 50 𝜇m thick slices using a sliding micro- 
tome and blockface  photos were taken for each section.  Every tenth slice 
was Nissl stained  for histological  analysis,  with individual  nuclei delin- 
eated following  the approach  of Jones (2012) . 
Blockface  photos were co-registered  to oneanother,  segmented  from 
the block holder and microtome,  and stacked  to form a 3D volume.  The 
3D stack of blockface  photos were used as an intermediary  for regis- 
tering ex vivo MRI and histologial  data. Nuclear  segmentations  iden- 
tiﬁed using Nissl staining  were transformed  into MRI space and re- 
ﬁned to account  for gaps between  blocks. The probablistic  atlas, based 
on a tetrahedral  mesh, was built following  the approach  described  by 
Iglesias  et al. (2015) . The generated  tetrahedral  mesh is locally adaptive  
to the shape of the thalamus,  with each vertex of the mesh having an 
associated  vector of probabilities  for thalamic  nuclei. The topology  and 
resolution  of the mesh varies based on anatomy,  with ﬁner detail in less 
uniform  regions.  
Segmentation  using the probabilistic  atlas is posed as a Bayesian  in- 
ference  problem,  and is modelled  with the following  assumptions  1. The 
atlas is spatially  warped  following  a deformation  model 2. The segmen-  
tation of each voxel is drawn independently,  based on the categorical  
distribution  of the deformed  atlas at that location",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5393, 5396), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(10584, 10588), match='  3.'>"

This paper extends frequency  domain quantitative  electroencephalography  (qEEG) methods  pursuing  higher sen- 
sitivity to detect Brain Developmental  Disorders.  Prior qEEG work lacked integration  of cross-spectral  informa-  
tion omitting  important  functional  connectivity  descriptors.  Lack of geographical  diversity  precluded  accounting  
for site-speciﬁc  variance,  increasing  qEEG nuisance  variance.  We ameliorate  these weaknesses.  (i) Create lifes- 
pan Riemannian  multinational  qEEG norms for cross-spectral  tensors. These norms result from the HarMNqEEG  
project fostered  by the Global Brain Consortium.  We calculate  the norms with data from 9 countries,  12 de- 
vices, and 14 studies, including  1564 subjects.  Instead of raw data, only anonymized  metadata  and EEG cross- 
spectral tensors were shared. After visual and automatic  quality control, developmental  equations  for the mean 
and standard  deviation  of qEEG traditional  and Riemannian  DPs were calculated  using additive  mixed-eﬀects  
models. We demonstrate  qEEG “batch eﬀects ”a n d provide methods  to calculate  harmonized  z-scores.  (ii) We 
also show that harmonized  Riemannian  norms produce  z-scores with increased  diagnostic  accuracy  predicting  
brain dysfunction  produced  by malnutrition  in the ﬁrst year of life and detecting  COVID induced  brain dysfunc-  
tion. (iii) We oﬀer open code and data to calculate  diﬀerent  individual  z-scores from the HarMNqEEG  dataset. 
These results contribute  to developing  bias-free,  low-cost  neuroimaging  technologies  applicable  in various health 
settings.  
1. Introduction  
Characterizing  the age-dependent  developmental  trajectories  of the 
brains of healthy  and diseased  individuals  is essential  for precision  
medicine.  Verdi et al. (2021) recently  emphasized  that we must move 
beyond  the “average  patient ”w h e n  using neuroimaging.  Instead,  we 
must understand  individual  diﬀerences  in brain aging processes  to al- 
low early detection  of functional  deterioration  and neurodegenerative  
disease.  Quantifying  these individual  developmental  trajectories  hinges 
on choosing  the proper “Descriptive  Parameters  ”(DPs)  that summarize  
brain anatomy  or physiology  features  and distinguishing  their normal  
or abnormal  evolution  during the lifespan.  These DPs depend  strongly  
on age ( Matou š ek and Petersén,  1973 ). 
Central  to the deﬁnition  of healthy  developmental  brain trajecto-  
ries is the creation  of age-dependent  developmental  “norms  ”( “charts ”
or “atlases  ”) comprising  both measures  of central population  tendency  
as well as dispersion.  The norms enable quantifying  the age-adjusted  
statistical  distance  of a subject’s  DP from the healthy  population.  Exam- 
ples of such distances  are the z-score or Mahalanobis  distance.  Armed 
with these age-dependent  statistical  distances,  we can quantify  Brain 
Developmental  Deviation  (BDD) and even use them to cluster and stage 
disease  progressions  ( Harmony,  1984 ). 
Large multinational  projects  to develop  norms are now underway.  
These projects  aim to increase  genotypic  and phenotypic  diversity  and, 
signiﬁcantly,  achieve  sample sizes to provide  adequate  statistical  power 
( Bethlehem  et al., 2022 ). These endeavors  have a fundamental  limita- 
tion due to the costly nature and sparse geographical  distribution  of 
the technologies  used to probe the brain. Large parts of the world pop- 
ulation,  even in high-income  countries,  are diﬃcult  or impossible  to 
sample.  Thus, issues of fairness  and racial bias cannot be ignored.  
In contrast  with other neurotechnologies,  electroencephalography  
(EEG) is aﬀordable,  portable,  and deployable  in all health system levels–
whatever  the economic  setting.  Thus EEG is a potential  tool for detecting  
BDD in a Global Health context  ( Valdés-Sosa  et al., 2021 ). Quantitative  
EEG (qEEG)  facilitates  this use by using EEG-based  DPs to compare  indi- 
viduals  with qEEG norms. The most common  embodiment  of qEEG uses 
the EEG log-power  spectrum  as DPs. The seminal  work of Matou š ek and 
Petersén  (1973) pioneered  this work 50 years ago, with the visionary  
introduction  of the “age-dependent  EEG quotients  ”t o measure  brain 
age —antedating  by 4 decades  current  interest  in this topic! This line of work John et al. ( 1977 ), Harmony  et al. (1988) , Bosch-Bayard  et al., 
(2001) , Bosch-Bayard  et al. (2020) , Hernandez-Gonzalez  et al. (2011 ) 
subsequently  systematized  this initiative.  Consequently,  developmen-  
tal norms were constructed  in several countries  ( Gordon  et al., 2005 ; 
Lorensen  and Dickson,  2003 ; Thatcher  et al., 2003 ). Other projects  re- 
cently vigorously  launched  are being repurposed  for normative  work 
( Pavlov et al., 2021 ). 
An instance  of norm construction  and evaluation  of BDD in a lower 
or middle-income  country  (LMIC) has been the Cuban Human  Brain 
Mapping  Project (CHBMP).  Its ﬁrst wave provided  norms (means  and 
standard  deviations  (SDs)) for the narrow  band (NB) log-spectral  DP 
based on 211 subjects  from age 5 to 97. Despite  being based on a sin- 
gle country  database,  CHBMP  norms describe  BDD consistently  in other 
countries  ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 2001 ; Bringas  Vega et al., 2019 ; Taboada-  
Crispi et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless,  the small sample sizes make country  
comparisons  relatively  underpowered  compared  to neuroimaging  eﬀorts 
such as ENIGMA  ( Thompson  et al., 2014 ). 
The lack of global inclusiveness  and small sample sizes in qEEG 
norms is a situation  that this paper attempts  to ameliorate  by construct-  
ing a multinational  norm based on 1564 EEGs from 9 countries  and 
14 EEG devices.  We used the novel collaboration  strategy  described  in 
Gazula et al., (2020) to facilitate  data-sharing.  Each site did not share 
raw data but rather processed  it with standardized  software.  The only 
information  shared for collaboration  was anonymized  data and the EEG 
cross-spectrum  of each subject.  
The diversity  of countries  and sites brought  the problem  of harmo-  
nization  to the forefront.  Harmonization  is the elimination  of “batch 
eﬀects ”. A batch eﬀect is a nuisance  variance  due to cross-site  equip- 
ment diﬀerences,  changes  over time of parameters  of experiments  that 
purport  to measure  the same underlying  biological  mechanisms,  and 
diﬀerent  preprocessing  of raw data. Genomics  was the ﬁrst to iden- 
tify and minimize  batch eﬀects with statistical  techniques.  One such 
well-known  technique  is COMBAT,  described  in ( Johnson  et al., 2007 ). 
Subsequently,  MRI multisite  studies identiﬁed  a similar problem  where 
batch eﬀects may be due to diﬀerent  acquisition  systems,  or varia- 
tions in protocols.  Recent eﬀorts to address  batch eﬀects have gained 
traction  in neuroimaging  ( Fortin et al., 2018 ; Pomponio  et al., 2020 ; 
Rutherford  et al., 2021 ). 
A multinational  EEG norm faces an even greater need for harmo-  
nization  than MRI, because  of the variability  of recording  systems  from 
diﬀerent  vendors  compounded  by the lack of standards.  Diﬀerent  ampli- 
2  M. Li, Y. Wang, C. Lopez-Naranjo  et al. NeuroImage  256 (2022) 119190 
ﬁer transfer  functions,  electrode  placement  systems,  preprocessing  pro- 
tocols beg the question  of EEG batch eﬀects. Despite  the apparent  need 
for harmonization,  to the best of our knowledge,  there are no statistical  
studies of batch eﬀects in qEEG. Therefore,  we propose  new statistical  
techniques  adapted  to the nature of EEG spectra  for this purpose  and try 
to identify  what variables  eﬀectively  deﬁne qEEG batches,  testing their 
eﬀect on the resulting  harmonized  norms and the ﬁnal practical  impact 
on measuring  BDD. 
We shall also remedy  a current  diﬃculty  with qEEG norms. As men- 
tioned before, these are predominantly  either for broad band (BB) sen- 
sor space log-spectra  DPs ( Ahn et al., 1980; John et al., 1988 )) or their 
narrow  band version  ( Szava et al., 1994 ; Valdés et al., 1992 ). This pref- 
erence for log-spectra  ignores  that all second-order  (linear)  properties  of 
quasi-stationary  EEGs are encoded  in the full cross-spectrum,  a tensor or 
multi-dimensional  array, Hermitian  frequency-dependent  matrices.  The 
diagonal  of each matrix contains  the spectra  for that frequency.  Using 
only that information  for qEEG ignores  the oﬀ-diagonal  elements,  which 
are the cross-spectra.  
To explain  the intrinsic  geometric  relation  of spectra  and cross- 
spectra,  we remind  the reader that this type of data belongs  to a Rie- 
mannian  manifold.  The related theory provides  the uniﬁed framework  
to deal with the cross-spectrum  in a principled  way. Proper distances  
between  samples  are not Euclidean  as in usual multivariate  statistics  
cross-spectrum,  but related concepts  appropriate  for Riemannian  mani- 
fold ( Pennec,  1999 ; Bhatia, 2007 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ; Sabbagh  et al., 
2020 ). 
Cross-spectra  are positive-deﬁnite  Hermitian  (HPD) matrices  that lie 
in a nonlinear  manifold,  a positive-deﬁnite  cone ( Bhatia, 2007 ). Pre- 
vious eﬀorts of the PAVS lab to construct  qEEG norms used the log- 
arithm as a transformation  towards  Gaussianity  and then followed  up 
with ordinary  univariate  statistics  cross-spectrum  to construct  norms 
( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 2001 ; Bringas  Vega et al., 2019 ; Szava et al., 1994 ; 
Taboada-Crispi  et al., 2018 ). In the Riemannian  framework,  the ma- 
trix logarithm  transforms  the whole cross-spectral  matrix towards  mul- 
tivariate  Gaussianity  (Riemannian  vectorization  ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; 
Barachant  et al., 2012 ; Sabbagh  et al., 2020 )). The approximate  mul- 
tivariate  gaussian  distribution  of log matrix covariance  matrices  has a 
long history ( Leonard  and Hsu, 1992 ) but has not yet been employed  in 
qEEG. 
Riemannian  geometry  has become  popular  in the Brain-Computer  
Interface  (BCI) literature,  with signiﬁcant  advantages  for classiﬁcation  
precision  ( Barachant  et al., 2013 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ; Yger et al., 
2017 ). Sabbagh  et al., (2020) recently  showed  that Riemannian  methods  
improve  brain age estimation  with MEG. However,  to our knowledge,  
the construction  of Riemannian  geometry-based  developmental  norms 
for EEG or MEG has not been attempted.  We remedy  this situation  in 
this paper, constructing  harmonized  norms for the Riemannian  vector- 
ized cross-spectra  and investigating  the existence  of batch eﬀects for this 
type of multinational  data. We also gauge the practical  eﬀect of these 
technical  reﬁnements  on discriminant  equations  between  out-of-sample  
controls  and pathological  subjects.  
We alert the reader that our previous  norms comprised  scalp and 
source space log spectra  ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 2001 ). The excessive  com- 
putational  complexity  of a Riemannian  source cross-spectral  analysis  is 
out of the present  paper’s  scope we postpone  this development  to future 
work. 
This paper is organized  as follows:  the methods  section contains  (1) 
the theoretical  basis of traditional  and Riemannian  qEEG DPs; (2) Gath- 
ering data and preprocessing  for the multinational  qEEG norm project;  
(3) Construction  of the harmonized  norms. In the section of results,  we 
present  (1) the quality control of the project;  (2) the eﬀect of centering  
on the cross-spectrum.  (3) the detection  of the batch eﬀect; (4) a pre- 
sentation  of harmonized  norms; and ﬁnally, we describe  the validation  
of the norms for detecting  BDD.

2.1. Traditional  and Riemannian  DPs based on EEG cross-spectrum  
Quantitative  electroencephalography  (qEEG)  studies DPs obtained  
from the electroencephalogram  (EEG). These DPs encode physiolog-  
ically relevant  information.  Here we explain  the frequency  domain  
DPs deﬁned  with the EEG cross-spectrum.  Nonlinear  frequency-domain  
( Billings  and Tsang, 1989a , 1989b ), time-domain  ( Koenig et al., 2002 ), 
or time/frequency  domain  ( Makeig  et al., 2004 ) DPs are also essential.  
In later stages of the multinational  qEEG normative  project,  we will in- 
clude these types of DPs. Table 2 summarizes  EEG frequency  domain  
DPs, which we now describe  formally.  
With (discrete)  Fourier  transform,  the EEG signal 𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝑡 ) (for the 
subject 𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑖 , at the channel  𝑐, 𝑐 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑐and epoch 𝑒 , 
𝑒 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑒 ) can be transformed  to the frequency  domain,  𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) 
(frequency  𝜔 = Δ𝜔, …, 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 where Δ𝜔 is the frequency  resolution)  
which is the complex-value  coeﬃcients.  The covariance  matrix across 
all epochs 𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) is the cross-spectral  matrix 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) at frequency  𝜔 . 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
is Hermitian  with elements  𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) . Note that the set of all 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) for 
all frequencies  𝜔 = Δ𝜔, …, 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 for a given subject 𝑖 is a 3-mode  
multi-dimensional  array with dimensions  𝑁 𝑐 ×𝑁 𝑐 ×𝑁 𝜔 . We remind  
the reader that this multi-dimensional  array is also known as a ten- 
sor , which we denote by S 𝑖 ( Fig. 1-a ). This concept  generalizes  that of 
a matrix.  An intuitive  way to think of the cross-spectral  tensor S 𝑖 is to 
consider  it a “slide box ”i n which each ""slide"" is a cross-spectral  ma- 
trix ( Fig. 1 -a). We defer a more formal discussion  about cross-spectra  as 
tensors to Appendix  A for the interested  reader. The set 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′(∶) for all 
frequencies  is known as a tube ( Fig. 1 -b). 
For example,  in this paper, the channel  number  𝑐 = 9 corresponds  to 
the recording  at the left occipital  channel  in the 10–20 system O1. 
2.1.1. Traditional  qEEG DPs 
The most traditional  DPs are the log-spectra  which are obtained  by 
applying  the logarithm  to the diagonal  elements  of cross-spectral  matri- 
ces 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ∈ℙ 𝑁𝑐 and stacking  them as a vector: 
𝝀( 𝜔 ) = [𝜆𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) , ], 
𝜆𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) = log (𝑠 𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) ), 
𝑐 = 1 , ..., 𝑁𝑐 
The complete  set of log spectral  DPs is then 𝐲 λ
𝑖 ∈ℝ NcN 𝜔 ( Fig. 1 -c), 
where 
𝐲 λ
𝑖 = [𝝀𝑖 ( Δ𝜔 ) 𝑇 , …, 𝝀𝑖 ( 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 ) 𝑇 ]𝑇 (1) 
This vector is unconstrained,  and therefore  the assumption  that the 
𝒚 λ
𝑖 is sampled  from a multivariate  Gaussian  distribution  is reasonable,  
providing  a natural  link to quantify  BDD using standard  univariate  and 
multivariate  statistical  distances.  
These are the “traditional  DPs ”with which the PAVS lab developed  
qEEG norms calling the narrowband  developmental  equations  “Devel-  
opmental  surfaces  ”( Szava et al., 1994 ) since they are bivariate  func- 
tions of frequency  and age. Developmental  Surfaces  describe  EEG scalp 
channels  and sources  ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 2001 ). These norms are now 
extensively  used, with open-source  data and code ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 
2020 ; Valdes-Sosa  et al., 2021 ). 
However,  the log spectra  DPs 𝐲 λ
𝑖 are measures  limited to separate  
channels.  The relations  between  channels  must be assessed  to study the 
vital aspect of functional  connectivity.  To do this, we must consider  
the oﬀ-diagonal  part of cross-spectral  matrices  1 . A popular  measure  is 
1 For some calculations,  using the complex  value of an oﬀ-diagonal  element  
𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) is inconvenient,  and instead, we decompose  these quantities  into their 
real and imaginary  parts (or absolute  values and phases).  We use the obvi- 
ous notation,  for example,  Real ( 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) ) , Imag ( 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) ) in the case of the cross- 
spectrum.

Unfortunately,  when bundled  as a set with log-spectral  DPs, these “tradi- 
tional DPs ”are not jointly multivariate  Gaussian  2 , even when applying  
any of the usual data transformations  separately  to each measure.  
2.1.2. Riemannian  qEEG DPs 
The diﬃculties  of traditional  DPs mentioned  above can be remedied  
with the concept  of Riemannian  geometry.  Since the cross-spectral  ten- 
sor S 𝑖 comprises  frontal slices 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , we consider  these ﬁrst. 
2.1.2.1.  Riemann  geometry  of the cross-spectra  at a single frequency.  The 
𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) are well-known  mathematical  objects that we already  identiﬁed  
as Hermitian  positive  deﬁnite  (HPD) matrices  with unique properties,  
as discussed  in depth in Bhatia (2007) . In particular,  these elements  of 
these matrices  do not distribute  freely in Euclidean  space but instead  live 
on the manifold  of positive  deﬁnite  (PD) matrices  ℙ 𝑁𝑐 and are restricted  
2 Empirical  multivariate  transformations  can achieve this objective  
( Biscay Lirio et al., 1989 ), but they are time-consuming  and not natural.

Fig. 1. The generation  of traditional  and Riemannian  DPs. (a) The cross-spectral  matrix 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) is the frontal slices of the tensor S 𝑖 ; (b) Fixing a channel and collecting

to a hyper-dimensional  cone ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; Barachant  et al., 
2012 ). This property  induces  dependencies  among the elements  of each 
matrix,  hence the nonlinear  nature of the underlying  manifold.  The 
curved nature of this manifold  precludes  the use of simple Euclidean  
distances  to quantify  distances  between  cross-spectra,  impeding  the cal- 
culation  of the usual norms and distances  of previously  involved  in 
normative  qEEG. Fortunately,  ℙ 𝑁𝑐 endowed  with the aﬃne invariant  
metric, is a complete  diﬀerentiable  Riemannian  manifold  ( Bhatia, 2007 ; 
Congedo  et al., 2017 ). 
In more detail, each point 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) on the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 is associated  with a 
local Euclidean  vector space, known as the tangent  space, denoted  
as 𝑇 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ℙ 𝑁𝑐 . Each tangent  space has a smoothly  varying  inner prod- 
uct, which deﬁnes the Riemannian  metric locally ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; 
Barachant  et al., 2012 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ). We use two operators  to 
pass from the manifold  to the tangent  space and back. The logarithmic  
mapping  projects  the 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) to the tangent  space 𝑇 𝐂 ℙ 𝑁𝑐 with respect to 
a reference  (centering)  matrix 𝐂 ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ), 
Lo g 𝐜 (𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) )= 𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
= 𝐂 1∕2 logm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )𝐂 1∕2 
where logm denotes  matrix logarithm  3 . Furthermore,  the inverse  oper- 
ator of logarithm  mapping  projects  the tangent  vector to the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 man- 
ifold with the exponential  mapping,  
Exp 𝐜 (𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) )= 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
= 𝐂 1∕2 expm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )𝐂 1∕2 
where expm is the matrix exponential.  
Thus, we can apply Euclidean  calculations  by transforming  the orig- 
inal curved ℙ 𝑁𝑐 manifold  to the tangent  space where we assume  that 
locally Gaussianity  holds ( Pennec,  1999 ). We achieve  this transforma-  
tion by the “Riemannian  vectorization  ” operator  ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; 
Congedo  et al., 2017 ; Sabbagh  et al., 2020 ) on cross-spectral  matrices,  
which produce  the vector 𝜽𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) with the transformation  of the space 
ℙ 𝑁𝑐 →ℂ 𝑁𝑚 . 
𝛉𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) = vech [logm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )](4) 
which is known as a parallel  transport  on the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 manifold.  Selec- 
tion of the matrix 𝐂 is crucial,  and a typical choice is to select it 
3 For matrix 𝐀 ∈ℙ 𝑛 , if the eigen decomposition  of 𝐀 is 𝐀 = 𝐔𝐋 𝐔 𝐻 , logm ( 𝐀 ) = 
𝐔 diag ( log ( 𝑙 1 ) , …, log ( 𝑙 𝑛 ) ) 𝐔 𝐻 and expm ( 𝐀 ) = 𝐔 diag ( exp ( 𝑙 1 ) , …, exp ( 𝑙 𝑛 ) ) 𝐔 𝐻 . to whiten a given 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , that is, to minimize  ‖𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) − 𝐈 Nc ‖2 
𝐹 . For sev- 
eral 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , we need to center the whole sample with a single 𝐂 , so 
that statistical  calculations  are carried out in a common  tangent  space 
( Arsigny  et al., 2005 ; Barachant  et al., 2013 ; Ng et al., 2016a ). This 
objective  is best achieved  when 𝐂 is closest in some sense to all 
the 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ( Hauberg  et al., 2013 ; Ng et al., 2016a ). If we have rea- 
son to believe  that 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) are already  whitened,  then 𝐂 = 𝐈 𝑁𝑐 , which 
is precisely  the Log-Euclidean  approach  to Eq. (4) ( Barachant  et al., 
2013 ; Ng et al., 2016b ). Nevertheless,  there is consensus  that the 
optimal  mean is 𝐶 = 𝐺( 𝑠 1 ( 𝜔 ) , ..., 𝑠 𝑁𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ) where the function  𝐺is the 
Karcher  mean ( Bhatia and Holbrook,  2006 ; Karcher,  1977 ), also known 
as the Riemannian  or geometric  mean ( Moakher,  2005 ; Bhatia and 
Holbrook,  2006 ). Also see ( Tuzel et al., 2008 ; Barachant  et al., 
2012 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ). The estimation  of the Karcher  mean 
is highly nonlinear  and must be calculated  using iterative  methods.  
In particular,  we use the software  implemented  by Bini and Ian- 
nazzo (2013) ( http://bezout.dm.unipi.it/software/mmtoolbox/  ) based 
on the Richardson-like  iteration.  Further  details about the Riemannian  
geometric  mean calculation  are in Appendix  B.1 . We emphasize  that 
though the calculation  of the matrix 𝐂 is highly nonlinear,  the appli- 
cation of the centering  operation  𝐂 − 1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 − 1∕2 is easily shown to be 
linear. 
2.1.2.2.  Riemannian  geometry  of the tensors S 𝑖 . Our objects of study 
are the S 𝑖 tensors which are HPD tensors,  not matrices.  Fortunately,  we 
can leverage  much work on speciﬁc  third-order  tensors ( Braman,  2010 ; 
Kilmer et al., 2013 ; Lund, 2020 ). These third-order  tensors have time 
or frequency  as the third dimension,  and an extensive  theory associated  
with the “t-product  ”has been developed,  which the PAVS lab has pre- 
viously  used to study time series ( Karahan  et al., 2015 ). Properties  of S 𝑖 
follow from those of the matrix 𝐒 𝐵 
𝑖 = blockdiag  ( 𝐒 𝑖 ( Δ𝜔 ) , …, 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 ) ) , 
which belongs  to ℙ 𝑁 𝑐𝑁 𝜔 thus inheriting  all the properties  described  
in the previous  section 4 . The centering  operation  in this new space 
is 𝐂 𝐵 − 1∕2 𝐒 𝐵 
𝑖 𝐂 𝐵 − 1∕2 , with 𝐂 𝐵 = blockdiag  ( 𝐂 ( Δ𝜔 ) , …, 𝐂 ( 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 ) ) . When 
we assume  the same centering  matrix for all frequencies,  then C = 
fold ( blockdia  g −1 ( 𝐈 𝑁𝜔 ⊗𝐂 )) . Thus, as with the single frequency  case, es- 
timating  the centering  matrix is a nonlinear  operation,  while applying  
tensor centering  𝐂 𝐵 − 1∕2 𝐒 𝐵 
𝑖 𝐂 𝐵 − 1∕2 is linear. We examine  the most appro- 
priate centering  strategy  for our data in Section",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5353, 5356), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(27817, 27821), match='  3.'>"

vidualized  analytical  methods  would facilitate  the use of such studies to 
understand  the dynamics  of neurodegeneration,  to develop  neuroimag-  
ing biomarkers,  and to ultimately  translate  research  ﬁndings  to monitor  
disease  progression  and evaluate  treatment  eﬃcacy  clinically.  Individ-  
ualized  analyses  are also less likely than group-average  analyses  to re- 
quire spatially  warping  participants’  brains to a standard  template.  Such 
warping  or normalization  can induce errors and inaccuracies,  particu-  
larly in individuals  with neurodegenerative  disease  and even in normal  
aging ( Eloyan et al., 2014; Kolinger  et al., 2021 ). 
Individual-level  estimates  of activation  based on conventional  task 
fMRI analysis  methods  have unfortunately  been found to exhibit poor 
reliability  ( Elliott et al., 2020 ), in part due to sub-optimal  statistical  
approaches  ( Monti, 2011 ). By far the most popular  method  for task 
fMRI analysis  is the classical  general  linear model (GLM) ( Worsley  and 
Friston,  1995 ). In this massive  univariate  approach,  at the ﬁrst level a 
separate  linear model is ﬁt at every voxel relating  the observed  BOLD 
activity  to the expected  response  to each task or stimulus.  At the sec- 
ond level, participant-level  estimates  are pooled to produce  group aver- 
age estimates  of activation  or diﬀerences  between  groups or conditions.  
Historically,  the classical  GLM has been considered  suﬃcient  in group- 
average  fMRI studies,  where the focus is on estimation  of robust eﬀects 
that are common  across most participants  ( Mumford  and Nichols,  2009 ). 
However,  eﬀects that are unique to individuals  or states are likely to 
be washed  out in a group analysis  ( Gupta et al., 2010; Stern et al., 
2009 ), and the classical  GLM has been shown to have low estimation  
eﬃciency  and power for subject-level  analysis  ( Mejia et al., 2020 ). Ad- 
ditionally,  many task fMRI analyses  are performed  in volumetric  space, 
which has a number  of drawbacks,  including  smoothing  across tissue 
classes and distal cortical  areas representing  distinct  functional  regions  
( Brodoehl  et al., 2020 ). 
Here, we adopt and extend our advanced  individualized  fMRI 
analysis  approach,  the cortical  surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM 
( Mejia et al., 2020 ), to better understand  the longitudinal  disease  pro- 
cess in amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis  (ALS), a rare, rapidly  progress-  
ing and heteroegenous  neurodegenerative  disease.  This approach  avoids 
data smoothing,  leverages  spatial dependencies  along the cortical  sur- 
face, and avoids the need for multiplicity  correction  —and the result- 
ing loss of power —in identifying  areas of activation.  It yields substan-  
tially more accurate  and powerful  activations  in individual  subjects  
( Mejia et al., 2020 ). We propose  a novel longitudinal  model extension,  
which leverages  information  shared across multiple  visits. Our analyses  
are performed  entirely  in native space to preserve  the unique anatomical  
and functional  features  of each participant  ( Gray et al., 2012; Kolinger  
et al., 2021 ), using the size of activations  above a certain eﬀect size as a 
summary  measure  that can be used in subsequent  longitudinal  analysis.  
Speciﬁcally,  we analyze  a rich longitudinal  study including  78 mo- 
tor task fMRI scans from 16 ALS participants  and 112 scans from 22 
age-matched  healthy  control (HC) participants.  Most ALS participants  
were enrolled  soon following  clinical  diagnosis,  and follow-up  scans oc- 
curred roughly  every 3 months  for as long as participants  were willing 
and able to participate  in the study. This study is unique in terms of the 
high frequency  and long duration  of sampling,  providing  an opportunity  
to understand  how disease  progression  evolves  dynamically  in diﬀerent  
individuals.  We apply our longitudinal  surface-based  spatial Bayesian  
GLM to each participant’s  data and extract summary  measures  of ac- 
tivation  at each visit. We then analyze  these summary  measures  using 
a series of longitudinal  mixed eﬀects models to study the relationship  
between  brain activation  and functional  disability  in ALS over time. 
Previous  studies have documented  ALS-related  motor disruptions  us- 
ing a variety of measures,  including  task activation  ( Konrad  et al., 2002; 
2006; Poujois  et al., 2013; Schoenfeld  et al., 2005; Stoppel  et al., 2014 ), 
functional  connectivity  ( Jelsone-Swain  et al., 2010; Menke et al., 2018 ), 
cortical  thickness  ( Agosta et al., 2012; Verstraete  et al., 2010 ), and struc- 
tural connectivity  ( Chapman  et al., 2014; Douaud  et al., 2011; Menke 
et al., 2012; Müller et al., 2016 ). Task activation  studies speciﬁcally  
have observed  hyper-activation  in patients  with ALS during motor tasks ( Konrad  et al., 2002; Poujois  et al., 2013; Schoenfeld  et al., 2005 ). How- 
ever, since these studies have been based on more limited sampling  de- 
signs ( Menke et al., 2018 ) and employed  group-average  analysis  ap- 
proaches,  they provide  limited insight into the heterogeneous  and typi- 
cally rapid disease  process  characterizing  ALS. 
Our longitudinal  analyses  reveal an inverted  U-shaped  trajectory  of 
motor activation  associated  with disease  progression  in ALS, with hyper- 
activation  initially  occurring  at relatively  low levels of motor disability,  
followed  by dramatic  loss of activation  occurring  at with more severe 
motor disability.  To our knowledge,  this is the ﬁrst time this inverted  
U-shaped  trajectory  has been observed  in ALS. Further,  we observe  sys- 
tematic  diﬀerences  by clinical  progression  rate, with fast progressors  
exhibiting  more extreme  hyper-activation  and more severe loss of acti- 
vation earlier in the disease  process.  Despite  the long-standing  interest  in 
spatial Bayesian  techniques  for task fMRI analysis  ( Friston and Penny, 
2003, 2007; Woolrich  et al., 2009 ), to our knowledge  this is the ﬁrst 
study of neurodegenerative  disease  that has employed  a surface-based  
spatial Bayesian  GLM, and illustrates  the power of this approach  to ex- 
tract new scientiﬁc  insights,  especially  when applied  to rich longitudinal  
fMRI studies.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
ALS participants  were recruited  through  the University  of Michigan  
ALS clinic and had been diagnosed  as having probable  or deﬁnite  ALS 
per the El Escorial  Criteria  ( Brooks,  1994 ). The project was approved  by 
the University  of Michigan  Institutional  Review  Board (HUM00000219).  
All participants  gave written  informed  consent  before participation.  
Healthy  controls  were recruited  from the local community  through  com- 
munity  advertising  and were balanced  on age. Participants  underwent  
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) at multiple  research  visits. For con- 
venience  for the ALS participants,  research  visits were scheduled  to co- 
incide with clinical  visits. Visits were scheduled  at roughly  3-month  in- 
tervals while minimizing  travel burden to participants  with ALS. Par- 
ticipants  with ALS continued  into the study until they could no longer 
tolerate  the MRI session,  decided  on their own accord to no longer par- 
ticipate,  or passed away. The sample used for analysis  included  190 
scanning  visits from 16 ALS participants  (78 visits) and 22 HC partici-  
pants (112 visits). ALS patient demographics  are given in Table 1 . The 
number  of visits per participant  ranged from 3 to 10 (median  = 4.5, 
mean = 5). Participants’  visit timing is shown in Supplementary  Fig. A1. 
Healthy  control participant  demographics  are given in Supplementary  
Table A1. 
At the time of each scanning  visit, ALS participants  had function  
assessed  with the ALS Functional  Rating Scale (revised)  (ALSFRS-R),  a 
standard  instrument  that is widely used in clinical  care and clinical  re- 
search ( Rooney  et al., 2017 ). ALSFRS-R  scores range from 48 (no impair-  
ment) to 0 (total impairment).  Fig. 1 displays  ALSFRS-R  trajectories  for 
each ALS participant  in the study, and Supplementary  Table A2 shows 
ALSFRS-R  scores at the ﬁrst and last visit for each participant.  All but 
two participants  had ALSFRS-R  scores over 35 at the ﬁrst visit, indicating  
a relatively  mild disease  state. Fig. 1 shows that many ALS participants  
experienced  wide range of disability  levels through  the course of the 
study. 
2.2. MRI data collection  
MRI data were collected  on a GE 3T Excite 2 scanner  (General  Elec- 
tric, Milwaukee,  Wisconsin).  A high-resolution  𝑇 1 -weighted  image was 
acquired  (3D SPGR, IR 500ms,  15 ◦ﬂip angle, TR = 9.036ms,  TE = 
1.84ms,  256 ×256 ×160 matrix,  1 . 102 ×1 . 102 ×1 . 2 mm resolution).  For 
image coregistration,  we also collected  a lower resolution  𝑇 1 -weighted  
image ( 85 ◦ﬂip angle, TR = 250ms,  TE = 5.70ms,  256 ×160 matrix,  3mm 
slice thickness  and no skip) at the same spatial locations  as the functional

(i.e. visual gain is increased  when the acoustic  speech signal is noisy in 
a audiovisual  (AV) listening  situation)  . 
On the one hand, this mentioned  audiovisual  facilitation  might be 
explained  by providing  simple temporal  cues (i.e. opening  and closing 
of mouth)  when having to attend to auditory  stimuli ( Van Engen et al., 
2019 ). On the other hand, visual information  might be preselecting  cer- 
tain possible  stimuli (e.g. phonemes)  and therefore  enhancing  subse- 
quent auditory  processing  as a form of crossmodal  integration.  By us- 
ing the additive  model (i.e. comparing  event-related  potentials  (ERP) to 
audio stimuli + ERPs visual stimuli (A + V) to ERPs of audiovisual  stim- 
uli (AV)), past studies indeed suggested  that the brain integrates  early 
information  from the visible lip movements  in the auditory  cortex for 
eﬃcient  speech processing  ( Besle et al., 2004 , 2009 ). 
In addition  to these eﬀects in auditory  processing  regions,  we have 
provided  evidence  for a direct visuo-phonological  transformation  when 
individuals  only process  visual information  (i.e. silent video record-  
ings of speakers),  by showing  that the acoustic  speech envelope  is 
tracked  in visual cortical  regions  when individuals  observe  lip move- 
ments ( Hauswald  et al., 2018 ; Suess et al., 2022 ). This is important,  be- 
cause the speech envelope  has been associated  with conveying  crucial 
information  about the syntactic  structure  of speech ( Giraud and Poep- 
pel, 2012 ; Poeppel  & Assaneo,  2020 ). Furthermore,  when provided  with 
visual-only  speech,  the visual cortex also tracks spectral  modulations  
in the range of the pitch, as well as in the second (F2) and third for- 
mant (F3), which reﬂect mainly sounds produced  with the visible part 
of the mouth ( Suess et al., 2022 ). These results align well with previous  
ﬁndings  by Chandrasekaran  et al. (2009) , who indicate  that the area of 
mouth opening  correlates  strongest  with spectral  components  of speech 
in the range of 1 kHz - 3 kHz, corresponding  to the frequency  range 
of F2 and F",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5335, 5338), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(2384, 2386), match='3.'>"

how these multiple  networks  support  the beneﬁts  from attention  re- 
directed  to working  memory.  Especially,  while selective  attention  is 
critical in forming  and maintaining  stable auditory  objects in memory  
( Fritz et al., 2007 ; Shinn-Cunningham,  2008 ; Wilsch and Obleser,  2016 ), 
how selective  attention-to-memory  aﬀects the internal  representations  
of auditory  working  memory  and the associated  neural implementations  
is not well speciﬁed.  
Prior auditory  working  memory  studies demonstrate  that both fea- 
tural and object-based  attention  re-directed  to memory  representations  
guided by retro-cues  improves  memory  performances  (e.g., Kumar et al., 
2013 ; Backer and Alain 2014 ; Backer et al., 2015 ; Lim et al., 2015 , 
2018 ; see Backer and Alain 2012 ; Zimmermann  et al., 2016 for re- 
views).  In particular,  studies utilizing  psychophysical  modeling  demon-  
strate that retrospective  auditory  attention  enhances  representational  
precision  of the attended  versus unattended  auditory  objects held in 
memory  ( Kumar et al., 2013 ; Lim et al., 2015 , 2018 ). Importantly,  such 
precision  beneﬁt has been reﬂected  in an attention-induced  increase  in 
neural activities  measured  via EEG (i.e., enhanced  sustained  negativity  
and neural alpha ( ∼10 Hz) oscillatory  power),  indicating  that greater 
cognitive  resource  is allocated  to the attended  memory  object. This work 
supports  the notion that retrospective  auditory  attention  enhances  the 
precision  of the memory  item, rather than reducing  cognitive  load by 
removing  the unattended  items from memory  ( Lim et al., 2015 ); how- 
ever, the limited spatial resolution  of EEG cannot delineate  how distinct  
functional  networks  of the brain contribute  to precision  beneﬁt from 
retrospective  attention.  
A few existing  fMRI studies provide  consistent  evidence  that retro- 
spective  attention  to auditory  memory  representations  actively  engages  
fronto-parietal  cortical  regions  as well as modality-speciﬁc  auditory  cor- 
tex. This evidence  suggests  that orienting  attention  to, and selective  ac- 
cessing of, auditory  memory  representations  rely upon both top-down  
control of attention  and perceptual  processes  ( Buchsbaum  et al., 2005 ; 
Johnson  et al., 2005 ; Backer et al., 2020 ). Nevertheless,  how these dis- 
tinct regions  across the brain —cognitive  control vs. auditory  processing  
regions-support  memory  representational  enhancement  via retrospec-  
tive attention  remains  unclear.  
To investigate  the neural underpinning  of auditory  retrospective  at- 
tentional  beneﬁt,  we conducted  an fMRI experiment,  in which partic- 
ipants performed  a previously  established  auditory  working  memory  
task —a delayed  recall of syllable  pitch discrimination  task ( Lim et al., 
2015 ; Alavash  et al., 2018 ; Lim et al., 2018 ). In this task, listeners  en- 
coded two speech syllable  sounds into memory  and then received  a 
retroactive  cue to direct attention  to one of the syllables  (i.e., auditory  
objects)  prior to recalling  lower-level  feature (pitch) of the object. In 
order to speciﬁcally  model the parameter  for precision  at which each 
participant  recalled  the syllable  object from memory,  we probed ﬁne- 
grained  parametric  changes  of the low-level  feature (e.g., Bays and Hu- 
sain 2008 ; Zhang and Luck 2008 ; Murray  et al., 2013 ; Lim et al., 2015 , 
2018 ). Here, we speciﬁcally  investigated  ( i ) whether  selective  atten- 
tion to auditory  memory  enhances  representational  ﬁdelity  by using a 
psychophysical  modeling  approach  ( Bays and Husain,  2008 ; Zhang and 
Luck, 2008 ; Murray  et al., 2013 ); ( ii ) how retrospective  attention  modu- 
lates the neural activities  in domain-general  and modality-speciﬁc  brain 
regions  by using univariate  fMRI analysis;  and ( iii ) whether  the speech 
memory  objects were retained  in aforementioned  brain regions,  and 
which of these brain regions  contribute  to the attentional  enhancement  
in mnemonic  ﬁdelity  using a multivariate  classiﬁer  approach  on fMRI 
data. 
We hypothesized  that if retrospective  attention  facilitates  working  
memory  performance  by enhancing  mnemonic  ﬁdelity  of the attended  
object, we would observe  higher precision  in recalling  the acoustic  fea- 
ture of the syllable  object held in memory,  and attention-related  in- 
crease in neural activations  in the domain-general  brain regions,  re- 
ﬂecting  the higher attentional  demands  to maintain  precise memory  
representations.  In addition,  we expect that the auditory  memory  object representations  distributed  across the brain —the domain-general  cogni- 
tive control and sensory-speciﬁc  brain regions  —would  contribute  to the 
attentional  enhancement  in mnemonic  ﬁdelity,  but potentially  in vary- 
ing degrees  given that functionally  discrete  brain regions  may retain ei- 
ther more abstracted  or sensory-speciﬁc  information  in working  memory  
( Lee et al., 2013 ; Ester et al., 2015 ; Christophel  et al., 2017 ). However,  
if retrospective  attention  reduces  working  memory  load by removing  
unattended  items from memory  ( Kuo et al., 2012 ; Souza et al., 2014 ), we 
expect to observe  an attention-related  decrease  in neural activations  in 
the domain-general  networks  (i.e., fronto-parietal  and cingulo-opercular  
networks),  and no direct relationship  between  the neural representa-  
tions of the auditory  memory  object to the mnemonic  precision  in re- 
calling the object. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-two  native German  speakers  (mean age: 27.9 years; SD: 2.75 
years; age range: 25–35; 12 females)  participated  in the experiment  that 
has been a part of a previously  published  study ( Alavash  et al., 2018 ). 
Participants  were recruited  from the participant  database  of the Max 
Planck Institute  for Human  Cognitive  and Brain Sciences  (Leipzig,  Ger- 
many). Two additional  participants  underwent  the study, but were ex- 
cluded from data analyses  due to excessive  head movements  ( > 5 mm). 
All participants  reported  normal  hearing,  and no history of neurological  
or psychiatric  disorders.  None of the participants  were under medica-  
tion. All participants  except one were right handed.  Based on our prior 
EEG and behavioral  work adopting  the similar auditory  retro-cueing  
task ( Lim et al., 2015 , 2018 ), we determined  that with 17 participants  
we would achieve  at least 80% power to detect the within-subject  eﬀect 
of retro-cues  even under simultaneous  noise in the background.  
All participants  gave their informed  written  consent,  and received  
ﬁnancial  compensation  for their participation.  The study procedure  was 
in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki.  The local ethics commit-  
tee (University  of Leipzig)  approved  the study. 
2.2. Stimuli 
The stimulus  material  was identical  to the ones used in previously  
published  studies ( Alavash  et al., 2018 ; Lim et al., 2015 , 2018 ). In brief, 
we used two German  syllables,  /da/ and /ge/. Each syllable  category  
consisted  of six naturally  spoken tokens,  truncated  from German  words 
recorded  by a trained  female speaker.  All sound tokens were digitized  
at 44.1 kHz, and 200-ms  in duration.  For each token, 3-ms and 30-ms 
linear ramps were applied  at sound onset and oﬀset, respectively.  
For each syllable  category,  two tokens served as to-be-probed  syl- 
lables in the syllable-pitch  discrimination  task. The pitch dimension  
(i.e., the fundamental  frequency;  F0) of each token was parametrically  
manipulated  in four steps: ± 0.125 and ± 0.75 semitones  from its F0; 
we chose these relatively  small step sizes in order to closely examine  
whether  selective  attention  to speech objects held in memory  beneﬁts  
precise recall of low-level  (pitch) information  of the cued object. The 
original  token was presented  during the syllable  encoding  phase, and the 
F0-manipulated  tokens were presented  as probes.  The average  F0’s of 
the to-be-probed  /da/ tokens were 162.8 Hz [min = 154.0, max = 171.7] 
and 175.5 Hz [min = 169.4, max = 18",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5393, 5396), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8581, 8583), match='3.'>"

In lieu of using externally  recorded  physiologic  signals,  attempts  
have been made to estimate  physiologic  time series components  in 
echo-planar  imaging  (EPI) data. Region of interest  (ROI)-based  meth- 
ods estimate  the physiologic  time series using signals from brain re- 
gions which mainly contain  blood pulsation  and respiratory  noise, 
such as white matter and ventricles  ( Fox et al., 2005 ; Jo et al., 2010 ; 
Weissenbacher  et al., 2009 ). Independent  component  analysis  (ICA) 
methods  have also been used to identify  physiologic  noise compo-  
nents with prior spatio-temporal  information  ( Beall and Lowe, 2007 ; 
Beckmann  et al., 2005 ; Behzadi  et al., 2007 ; Perlbarg  et al., 2007 ; 
Pruim et al., 2015 ; Thomas  et al., 2002 ). For example,  CORSICA  em- 
ploys spatial ICA analysis  with spatial priors, e.g. brain stems and ven- 
tricles, to select physiologic  noise components  ( Perlbarg  et al., 2007 ). 
Another  method,  CompCor,  deﬁnes temporal  physiologic  noise compo-  
nents using principal  component  analysis  (PCA) in anatomically-deﬁned  
“noise ” ROIs,  e.g. white matter,  cerebral  spinal ﬂuid (CSF) and large 
vessel areas ( Behzadi  et al., 2007 ). ICA methods  have also been used to 
develop  automated  approaches  to selection  of physiologic  noise compo-  
nents ( De Martino  et al., 2007 ; Tohka et al., 2008 ). FMRIB’s  ICA-based  
X-noiseiﬁer  (FIX) proposes  fully automatic  selection  of motion and phys- 
iologic noise components  ( Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), and has been 
validated  in a large dataset ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ). 
Typically,  ICA methods  select physiologic  noise components  with 
1/TR sampling  rate. Assuming  the sample rate of the heartbeat  is 1 Hz, 
a TR of less than 0.5 seconds  is necessary  to detect direct cardiac  ﬂuctu- 
ations in rs-fMRI  data. At longer TRs, direct cardiac  and/or respiratory  
ﬂuctuations  are aliased in the low frequency  range of the selected  com- 
ponent(s)  ( Lowe et al., 1998 ). For this reason,  most ROI- and ICA-based  
methods  detect aliased low frequency  cardiac  and respiratory  ﬂuctua-  
tions and are optimized  to represent  not only direct and but also indirect  
physiologic  noise components  ( Salas et al., 2021 ). The overall aim of our 
work is to detect direct physiologic  noise, without  the use of external  
physiologic  signal measures,  and to remove  it eﬀectively.  
The physiologic  signal estimation  and removal  method  known as 
Physiologic  EStimation  by Temporal  ICA (PESTICA)  uses slicewise  ICA 
to select physiologic  noise components  ( Beall and Lowe, 2007 ). The se- 
lected components  for each slice are concatenated  according  to the slice 
acquisition  timing,  then physiologic  signals are estimated  using a sam- 
pling rate of total slice number/TR,  fast enough  to detect direct phys- 
iologic noise ﬂuctuations  (see Theory:  Description  of PESTICA  ). Recent 
work using deep learning  conﬁrms  the ability of fast slicewise  sampling  
to estimate  cardiac  cycled noise ( Aslan et al., 2019 ). 
This work consists  of three parts: 1) the introduction  of the physio-  
logic hemodynamic  phase function  using RETROICOR,  2) the ﬁnding  of 
a locally varying  cardiac  time shift in the cardiac  phase function  and 3) 
the subsequent  modiﬁcation  of PESTICA.  
The ﬁrst part of this work uses measured  pulse plethysmograph  and 
respiratory  bellows  signals with RETROICOR  and introduces  the con- 
cept of physiologic  hemodynamic  phase functions  in imaging  data. The 
phrase “hemodynamic  phase function  ”is deﬁned  as between  the peak- 
to-peak  waveform  of plethysmograph  and respiratory  bellows  signals,  
as in RETROICOR.  Note that this diﬀers from the phrase “hemody-  
namic response  function,  ”w h i c h  is described  as a function  of time, 
convolved  by the respiration  volume  or heart rate ( Birn et al., 2008b ; 
Chang et al., 2009 ; Kassinopoulos  and Mitsis, 2019 ). The hemodynamic  
phase function  reﬂects  direct physiologic  noise, while the hemodynamic  
response  function  reﬂects  indirect,  low frequency  physiologic  noise ﬂuc- 
tuations.  
In the second part of this work, we ﬁnd that the cardiac  hemody-  
namic phase function  is time or phase-shifted  locally,  and the respiratory  
hemodynamic  phase function  is described  as single, ﬁxed phase form 
across the brain. Based on this ﬁnding,  we use externally  measured  phys- 
iologic signals to calculate  averaged  phase functions  and subsequent  
cardiac  and respiratory  ﬁxed phase regressors.  These measured  ﬁxed 
phase regressors  represent  single cardiac  and respiratory  noise compo-  
nents. Using the measured  ﬁxed phase regressors,  we test the detection  and removal  of direct physiologic  noise using various  physiologic  noise 
models.  
In the third part of this work, we update the PESTICA  software  al- 
gorithm  to account  for the cardiac  time shift, referring  to the resulting  
update as “cPESTICA,  ”for “cardiac  time shift corrected  ”PESTICA.  Us- 
ing the cPESTICA  algorithm,  we estimate  ﬁxed phase cardiac  and res- 
piratory  regressors  without  the use of externally  measured  physiologic  
signals.  Using the estimated  ﬁxed phase regressors,  physiologic  noise is 
removed  using the proposed  ﬁxed phase regressor  model. Finally,  we use 
the externally  measured  physiologic  data to compare  the performance  
of cPESTICA  to RETROICOR.  The source codes and software  tool pack- 
age for the proposed  method  and algorithm  are available  to the public 
at [TBA]. 
2. Theory  
2.1. Description  of RETROICOR  
RETROICOR  is a commonly  used physiologic  noise correction  
method  that includes  two steps: 1) modeling  physiologic  signals re- 
ﬂected in the image domain  and 2) regression  of physiologic  signals 
from the time series data. Here, we use the term “RETROICOR  model ”
to indicate  the Fourier  series expansion  of the physiologic  signal compo-  
nent based on the deﬁned  cardiac  and respiratory  phases,  as described  
below. 
Using signals from a pulse plethysmograph  and respiratory  belt, the 
cardiac  phase is linearly  deﬁned  from 0 to 2 𝜋between  successive  R- 
wave peaks ( Hu et al., 1995 ), and the respiratory  phase is deﬁned  in the 
range of - 𝜋to 𝜋across each respiration  cycle, i.e. in-/exhalation,  based 
on the histogram-equalized  transfer  function  which considers  the breath 
depth ( Glover et al., 2000 ). After synchronizing  the relative  cardiac  and 
respiratory  phases to slice acquisition  time, the multi-order  harmonic  
Fourier  series of each physiologic  noise component  is expanded  with 
the corresponding  phases in each slice acquisition  time: 
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 ( 𝑎 𝑐,𝑚 cos (𝑚 𝜑 𝑐 )+ 𝑏 𝑐,𝑚 sin (𝑚 𝜑 𝑐 )+ 𝑎 𝑟,𝑚 cos (𝑚 𝜑 𝑟 )
+ 𝑏 𝑟,𝑚 sin (𝑚 𝜑 𝑟 )) (1) 
where subscripts  c and r represent  cardiac  and respiratory  data, respec- 
tively, and 𝜑 𝑐,𝑟 is the corresponding  phase at time t. RETROICOR  is ex- 
pected to account  for this cardiac  sine harmonic  shift through  the use 
of voxelwise  Fourier  series expansion.  
2.2. Calculation  of cardiac and respiratory  hemodynamic  phase functions  
We derive voxelwise  cardiac  and respiratory  hemodynamic  phase 
functions  using the RETROICOR  model, Eqn (1) : 
𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐹 𝑢𝑛 ( 𝜑 ) = 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 𝑎 𝑚 cos ( 𝑚𝜑 ) + 𝑏 𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝑚𝜑 ) (2) 
where coeﬃcients  are deﬁned  in Eqn [1] . 
Then, phase functions  are extended  using Ptolemy’s  theorem:  
𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐹 𝑢𝑛 ( 𝜑 ) = 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 √ 
𝑎 2 
𝑚 + 𝑏 2 
𝑚 ⎛ 
⎜ 
⎜ 
⎜ ⎝ 𝑎 𝑚 √ 
𝑎 2 
𝑚 + 𝑏 2 
𝑚 cos ( 𝑚𝜑 ) + 𝑏 𝑚 √ 
𝑎 2 
𝑚 + 𝑏 2 
𝑚 sin ( 𝑚𝜑 ) ⎞ 
⎟ 
⎟ 
⎟ ⎠ 
(3) 
Replacing  𝑎 𝑚 √
𝑎 2 𝑚 + 𝑏 2 𝑚 and 𝑏 𝑚 √
𝑎 2 𝑚 + 𝑏 2 𝑚 with 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜑 𝑚 ) and 𝑐𝑜𝑠 ( 𝜑 𝑚 ) respec- 
tively, the equation  above can be described  as: 
𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐹 𝑢𝑛 ( 𝜑 ) = 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 √ 
𝑎 2 
𝑚 + 𝑏 2 
𝑚 ( sin (𝜑 𝑚 ) cos ( 𝑚𝜑 ) + cos (𝜑 𝑚 )sin ( 𝑚𝜑 ) )
= 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 √ 
𝑎 2 
𝑚 + 𝑏 2 
𝑚 sin (𝑚𝜑 + 𝜑 𝑚 )(4)

quency  activity  (see e.g.: Foxe & Snyder,  2011 ), and increases  the gain of 
spatially  tuned population  responses  ( Foster, Thyer, Wennberg,  & Awh, 
2021 ). However,  several key questions  on the spatio-temporal  proper-  
ties of covert attention  remain open: some studies (see e.g.: Luck, 1995 ) 
suggest  that spatial distribution  of attention  is dependent  on time, and 
have used the size of the attentional  focus to identify  attentional  sub- 
processes.  However,  these studies have not attempted  to systematically  
measure  attentional  modulation  in the visual ﬁeld. Moreover,  there is no 
consensus  on the earliest  processing  stage at which attention  modulates  
sensory  input. Whereas  animal studies with macaques  have shown that 
attention  eﬀects are already  present  in the primary  visual cortex and 
even in the lateral geniculate  nucleus  ( McAlonan,  Cavanaugh,  & Wurtz, 
2008 ), it is not known how well this ﬁnding  generalizes  to humans:  clear 
attention  eﬀects have been found in extrastriate  cortex but whether  the 
ﬁrst cortical  feedforward  sweep is aﬀected  remains  debated  ( Alilovi ć, 
Timmermans,  Reteig, Van Gaal, & Slagter,  2019 ; Baumgartner,  Graulty,  
Hillyard,  & Pitts, 2018 ). 
Compared  to fMRI studies of visual cortical  representations,  the spa- 
tial resolution  of M/EEG  is commonly  thought  to be severely  limited.  
Spatial resolution  of MEG is often deﬁned  as the ability to localize  ac- 
tive cortical  sources  through  inverse  modeling.  Visual cortex with its 
complex  geometry  and several concurrently  active sources  poses a chal- 
lenge here. Moreover,  because  of cortical  folding,  MEG is thought  to 
have poor sensitivity  for neural signals originating  from early visual 
cortices.  This problem  is evident  with spatially  extended  stimuli,  where 
synchronous  sources  at opposite  banks of the calcarine  sulcus may re- 
sult in cancellation  of the evoked  neuromagnetic  ﬁelds ( Ahlfors  et al., 
2010 ; Kupers,  Benson,  & Winawer,  2021 ). With spatially  focal stimuli,  
however,  MEG may be able to spatially  resolve signals better than EEG 
(for a review,  see: Baillet, 2017 ). In this study, we use a novel combi- 
nation of multifocal  retinotopic  mapping  MEG technique  and multivari-  
ate pattern  analysis  at the MEG sensor level to overcome  some of these 
limitations.  The multifocal  technique  ( Henriksson,  Karvonen,  Salminen-  
Vaparanta,  Railo, & Vanni, 2012 ; James, 2003 ) works by stimulating  the 
visual ﬁeld using multiple,  time-varying  stimulus  sequences  so that tem- 
poral sequences  at every location  are statistically  independent.  We used 
a behavioral  attention  task concurrently  with the multifocal  MEG map- 
ping stream so that the participants’  task was to indicate  a slight and 
rapid change in color in one of the stimulus  regions:  either at ﬁxation,  
at a region located  at the left lower or at a region located  at the right 
lower visual ﬁeld. The experiment  was done in blocks, where the loca- 
tion of the attentional  task was varied. We applied  multivariate  pattern  
analysis  to look for attentional  eﬀects on the stimulus-evoked  responses.  
Our approach  enables  estimation  of the attentional  modulation  in every 
stimulated  part of the visual ﬁeld with high temporal  resolution,  and 
thus investigation  of its temporal  dynamics  across the visual ﬁeld. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Subjects  
MEG data were collected  from twenty subjects  (15 females;  mean 
age 22, age range 19–29).  Four additional  subjects  were recruited  but 
they dropped  out from the study either before or during the data collec- 
tion, due to dental braces causing  strong artifacts  in the measured  MEG 
signals.  Ethical approval  for the research  was obtained  from the Aalto 
University  Ethics Committee.  Subjects  gave written  informed  consent  
before participating  in the study. 
2.2. Multifocal  stimuli and experimental  design 
The multifocal  stimulus  consisted  of 3 annuli, each having 8 sec- 
tors (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary  Video S1 ). The inner radius was 0.5 
and outer radii were 2.3, 4.7 and 8.4 degrees.  We used pattern-onset  
stimulation,  where the checkerboard  stimulus  pattern  appears  abruptly  
and then fades out as a linear function  of time. The 24 distinct  regions  ( Fig. 1 A) were stimulated  asynchronously  and in parallel,  so that the 
stimulus  regions  that were ‘on’ during each trial were determined  using 
orthogonal  stimulation  sequences  ( James, 2003 ; Vanni, Henriksson,  & 
James, 2005 ). We used a quadratic  residue  binary sequence,  as origi- 
nally proposed  by James (2003) for multifocal  EEG and later adapted  
for multifocal  fMRI by Vanni et al (2005) . Trial onset was randomized  so 
that its duration  varied between  217–317  ms (trial-onset-asynchrony).  
Each run contained  469 trials and lasted approximately  2.5 minutes.  
Before the onset of the multifocal  stimulus  sequence,  full-ﬁeld  checker-  
board stimulus  was ﬂashed  20 times to habituate  the response  and to 
prepare  the subject for the task. 
Data were collected  during three diﬀerent  tasks: (1) color change 
detection  task at the ﬁxation  point, (2) color change detection  task at 
a target region in the right visual ﬁeld, and (3) color change detection  
task at a target region in the left visual ﬁeld ( Fig. 1 A). Stimuli  were iden- 
tical in all tasks while task demands  were varied. During a color change,  
an entire 4 ×4 checkerboard  pattern  corresponding  to one stimulus  re- 
gion in the multifocal  stimulus  either in the left or right hemiﬁeld  was 
overlaid  with green color, lasting for 800 ms. Subjects  were instructed  
to respond  with a ﬁnger lift as soon as they noticed  a color change in 
the attended  location.  In the ﬁxation  task, the ﬁxation  cross changed  its 
color from red to green. The left and right target regions  were overlaid  
with a light green color plate to minimize  spatial uncertainty  about at- 
tention  target location.  Target changes  were also present  in the ignored  
attentional  location,  but subjects  were instructed  to ignore the color 
changes  when not speciﬁcally  instructed  to pay attention  to them. In 
other words, the visual stimulus  was exactly same in the attend left and 
attend right task conditions.  The subjects  also responded  by lifting the 
same ﬁnger whatever  the task. The task type (attention,  ﬁxation)  and 
the location  of the attention  task was communicated  before the start of 
each experiment  run. 
Seven runs were acquired  for each of the three tasks. Order of task 
runs was interleaved.  The ﬁxation  task was always the ﬁrst whereas  the 
order of the left and right task runs was pseudo-randomized  between  
the subjects.  In addition,  1-minute  rest MEG data were collected  at the 
beginning  of the measurement,  in the middle,  and at the end of the 
measurement.  18 of the 20 subjects  completed  all task runs (seven per 
task). With the remaining  two subjects,  we discarded  one task run of 
each task type due to problems  with data collection  during at least one 
run. 
The stimuli were presented  on a semitransparent  screen with a 3- 
DLP projector  (Panasonic  PT-D7700E)  using PsychoPy  version  1.82.01  
( Peirce, 2009 ). Eye-gaze  was followed  using an SR Research  Eye- 
Link1000  system (SR-Research  Ltd., Ontario,  Canada;  sampling  rate 500 
Hz). The subjects  had practised  the tasks at the Aalto Behavioral  Labo- 
ratory before the MEG data collection.

adults in order to construct  such a template  is still complicated  due to 
long scan times, motion artifacts,  and/or low signal to noise ratio. 
Super resolution  algorithms  are a set of methods  used to enhance  the 
spatial resolution  of an image, either from multiple  low resolution  im- 
ages of the same object with slightly  diﬀerent  perspectives  ( Farsiu et al., 
2004 ; Kim et al., 2015 ; Yuan et al., 2010 ), or from a single low resolution  
image ( Bevilacqua  et al., 2012 ; Glasner  et al., 2009 ; Ledig et al., 2016 ; 
Lim et al., 2017 ; Rueda et al., 2013 ). In neuroimaging,  multiple  im- 
age super resolution  overcomes  some of the aforementioned  limitations  
associated  with acquiring  MRI data in older adults at high spatial reso- 
lution ( Plenge et al., 2012 ; Scherrer  et al.,2012  ; Gholipour  et al., 2010 ; 
Greenspan  et al., 2002 ; He et al., 2007 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Rousseau  et al., 
2006 ; Shilling  et al., 2009 ; Sui et al., 2019 ). The concept  of multiple  
image super resolution  can also be adapted  for the construction  of a 
high resolution  population-based  brain MRI template  from low resolu- 
tion images on individual  subjects,  assuming  careful alignment  of indi- 
viduals  to a common  space and considering  every co-registered  image 
as a diﬀerent  realization  of the template  brain. A similar approach  was 
successfully  used in the development  of a high angular  (not spatial)  res- 
olution  diﬀusion  imaging  (HARDI)  brain template  from low angular  res- 
olution  diﬀusion  data on individual  subjects  (i.e. super resolution  in an- 
gular sampling)  ( Varentsova  et al., 2014 ). This approach  therefore  holds 
promise  for the development  of a high spatial resolution  T1w template  
of the older adult brain from lower spatial resolution  data on individ-  
ual subjects,  and avoids the limitations  associated  with collecting  high 
resolution  data on a large number  of older adults. 
The purpose  of this work was twofold:  (A) to develop  a high resolu- 
tion standardized  T1w template  of the older adult brain using principles  
of super resolution  as part of an ongoing  project to develop  a comprehen-  
sive older adult brain atlas named Multichannel  Illinois Institute  of Tech- 
nology & Rush university  Aging (MIITRA)  atlas, and (B) to systemati-  
cally compare  the new template  to other standardized  and study-speciﬁc  
templates  in terms of image quality and performance  when used as a ref- 
erence for alignment  of older adult data. First, T1w data with isotropic  
1mm voxels were collected  on a large number  of well-characterized  non- 
demented  older adults (65–95 years of age). Next, the 0.5mm resolution  
MIITRA  T1w template  was generated  by applying  principles  of super res- 
olution  to the available  data. The image quality of the new template  was 
compared  to that of other standardized  and study-speciﬁc  templates  in 
terms of the ability to resolve small brain structures,  image sharpness,  
and presence  of artifacts.  The performance  of the new template  when 
used as a reference  for alignment  of older adult data was evaluated  in 
terms of the inter-subject  spatial normalization  precision,  ability to de- 
tect small inter-group  morphometric  diﬀerences,  and representativeness  
of the older adult brain. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Data 
Two older adult brain MRI datasets  were used in this work. Dataset  1 
was used for constructing  the new high resolution  T1w template.  Dataset  
1 consisted  of T1w brain MRI data collected  on 222 community-based  
non-demented  older adults (65–95 age-range,  mean ± sd age = 80.1 ± 8.3 
years, 50% female)  participating  in the Rush Memory  and Aging Project 
( Bennett  et al., 2018 ). All participants  signed an informed  consent  ac- 
cording  to procedures  approved  by the institutional  review board of 
Rush University  Medical  Center.  T1w data were collected  on a 3 Tesla 
(T) Siemens  scanner  for 171 participants  and on a 3 T Philips scanner  
for 51 participants  using a 3D magnetization  prepared  rapid acquisition  
gradient  echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  with the following  parameters:  3 T 
Siemens  scanner:  TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, 
ﬁeld of view = 256 mm x 256 mm, 176 slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 
mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 2; 3 T Philips scanner:  TR = 8 ms,

Previous  animal studies have shown that the modulation  of early 
visual cortex by walking  speed can be independent  of visual input as 
it persists  in complete  darkness  ( Dipoppa  et al., 2018 ; Erisken  et al., 
2014 ; Keller et al., 2012 ). Similarly,  a recent walking  study in humans  
found a movement  related alpha power decrease  in both light and dark- 
ness ( Cao et al., 2020 ). This suggests  that the activity  changes  intro- 
duced by walking  have a non-visual  basis which can be reﬂected  by 
alpha power changes.  Indeed,  the alpha power decrease  during walking  
is a robust eﬀect and has been shown by several groups ( Ehinger  et al., 
2014 ; Lin et al., 2014 ; Peterson  and Ferris, 2018 ; Storzer et al., 2016 ; 
Yokoyama  et al., 2021 ). Albeit the fact that the alpha modulation  can 
be independent  of the visual input, a recent ﬁnding  indicated  that the 
walking  related alpha power is associated  with a change in the spatial 
distribution  of visual input processing  during walking  ( Cao and Hän- 
del, 2019 ). This could indicate  that alpha marks a processing  state which 
is modiﬁed  by walking.  In the study at hands we therefore  asked if the al- 
pha activity,  as modulated  by walking,  predicts  the changed  early VEPs 
following  sensory  input. Indeed,  in previous  studies a correlation  be- 
tween pre-stimulus  alpha power and the early VEPs has been described  
( Brandt and Jansen,  1991 ; De Blasio and Barry, 2013 ; Roberts  et al., 
2014 ). While the inﬂuence  of walking  on continuous  alpha power as 
well as early VEPs is known,  a relationship  between  these processes  has 
not been established  during walking.  This however  would constitute  an 
important  step in understanding  how walking  inﬂuences  early sensory  
processing.  
A second important  aspect was to test if the walking  induced  change 
in processing  is based on a general  modulation  of state or if it is input 
speciﬁc.  If general  in nature, the walking  induced  eﬀect should already  
be found before stimulus  onset and be similar for every stimulus  manip- 
ulation.  In other words, there should be no interaction  between  stimulus  
features  and movement  state. In contrast,  the change in the response  to 
sensory  input might be speciﬁc  to certain aspects  of sensory  processing.  
In this case, one should ﬁnd a signiﬁcant  interaction  between  stimulus  
features  and movement  state, given that the relevant  features  are in- 
deed included.  In order to test this, we manipulated  the stimulus  with 
respect to target location,  distractor  presence  and eccentricity.  These 
manipulations  were chosen because  of the involvement  of alpha activ- 
ity in distractor  inhibition  ( Clayton  et al., 2015 ; Foxe and Snyder,  2011 ; 
Händel  et al., 2011 ; Schroeder  et al., 2018 ; Wostmann  et al., 2019 ) 
and the diﬀerential  eﬀect of walking  on neural and behavioural  mea- 
sures over the visual ﬁeld ( Cao and Händel,  2019 ). The main aim of the 
study was to understand  the relationship  between  the movement  state 
induced  changes  in ongoing  alpha activity  and the amplitude  modula-  
tion of VEPs. However,  in order to further establish  this alpha activity  
as a marker  of state, we additionally  investigated  another  state change 
that is experienced  during the course of an experiment.  To this end, we 
analysed  the change in alpha power as well as the behavior  over the 
whole period of the experiment.  
To investigate  the nature of the eﬀect of movement  state on early sen- 
sory processing,  electrophysiological  data and behavioural  performance  
were collected  while participants  performed  a line orientation  discrim-  
ination task ( Fig. 1 ) during free walking  vs. standing  using AR glasses 
and mobile EEG. Pre-stimulus  and post-stimulus  neural responses  were 
both investigated  as a comparison.  We replicated  previous  ﬁndings  of an 
enhanced  N1 and a reduced  P3 component  during walking  but further 
showed  that these components  were predicted  by the pre-stimulus  alpha 
power. Additionally,  no evidence  was found that the eﬀect of walking  
was dependent  on the stimulus-related  factors (target location,  distrac-  
tor presence  and eccentricity),  therefore  suggesting  that walking  can in- 
duce a rather general  change in the internal  state. Alpha power, which 
we interpret  as a marker  of the internal  state, was also modulated  by 
time on the task and may be related to a learning  eﬀect. This was inde- 
pendently  found during movement  and stationarity.  Besides  the general  
movement  related change in state, we found a second,  stimulus  spe- 
ciﬁc inﬂuence  of walking.  Stimulus  induced  alpha power showed  less 
modulation  during walking  throughout  the task but was particularly  inﬂuenced  by eccentricity  and distractor  presence,  which was neither  
predicted  by pre-stimulus  alpha power nor modulated  by time on the 
task. Our ﬁndings  indicate  dissociable  pre- and post-stimulus  inﬂuences  
of walking  on visual processing.  One is marked  by pre-stimulus  alpha 
power and predicts  the amplitude  of early sensory  responses  to any vi- 
sual input. The other is marked  by stimulus  induced  alpha power and is 
speciﬁc  for visual features.

Decreasing  the injected  tracer activity  would lower radiation  expo- 
sure to the patient ( Gatidis et al., 2016 ) and staﬀ, and further reduce 
imaging  costs while allowing  more patients  to be examined  from a sin- 
gle radiotracer  production  ( Kaplan and Zhu, 2019 ; Xu et al., 2017 ). 
Conversely,  scan time could be reduced  at the standard  injected  ac- 
tivity to optimize  the scanner  use. The resulting  noise and informa-  
tion loss in images might impair the diagnostic  accuracy.  In recent 
years denoising  algorithms  using deep learning  have become  power- 
ful tools for synthesizing  standard-quality  PET images from low-activity  
ones ( Ladefoged  et al., 2021 ; Xiang et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2017 ). The 
deep learning  approach  is more successful  than classical  denoising  tools 
since the underlying  neural network  can learn speciﬁc  features  per- 
taining to the dataset,  while classical  denoising  algorithms,  like the 
wavelet  transform,  are content  agnostic  ( Pan et al., 1999 ). A U-Net 
model ( Ronneberger  et al., 2015 ) is a fully convolutional  network  orig- 
inally proposed  for medical  image segmentation.  It consists  of contract-  
ing (encoder  part) and symmetrically  expanding  paths (decoder)  for 
feature extraction  at diﬀerent  resolution.  As a result, the architecture  
is ideal for image-to-image  synthesis  (style transfer,  super resolution,  
etc.) and is, therefore,  ubiquitous  in the ﬁeld of medical-image  denois-  
ing ( Lu et al., 2019 ; Xiang et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2017 ). 
In this study we explored  brain [ 11 C]PiB and [ 18 F]FE-PE2I  PET scans 
from a large data set of patients  referred  for either clinically  uncertain  
AD dementia  or PD. We investigated  the feasibility  of delivering  a reli- 
able diagnosis  with low-dose  PET images denoised  with a deep learning  
model. Low-activity  images were obtained  through  simulated  dose re- 
duction  equivalent  to 5% of standard  injected  dose or shortened  scan- 
ning time. We present  one network  comprising  a U-Net enriched  with 
attention-mechanism  blocks, from which two independent  models are 
trained  on their respective  patient cohort, one per each condition/tracer.  
Importantly,  the two tracers under investigation  have a strikingly  dif- 
ferent uptake signature:  amyloid  pathology  is predominantly  diﬀuse in 
the cortex and basal ganglia  with a matching  distribution  of [ 11 C]PiB, 
as well as non-speciﬁc  white matter accumulation,  while [ 18 F]FE-PE2I  
targets DAT with high selectivity  ( Shingai  et al., 2014 ), yielding  a very 
high contrast  in the putamen  and caudate  nuclei compared  to the sur- 
rounding  brain. Yet, the presented  network  is able to handle these very 
diﬀerent  tracer distributions.  
Most previous  deep learning  studies with a U-Net model in brain 
PET images have used the 2-[ 18 F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-  d -glucose  ([ 18 F]FDG)  
( Kaplan and Zhu, 2019 ; Lu et al., 2019 ; Xiang et al., 2017 ; 
Xu et al., 2017 ) and the amyloid  [ 18 F]ﬂorbetaben  ( Chen et al., 2019 ; 
Ouyang  et al., 2019 ) tracers with only a limited number  of patients  used 
for training  (5 to 40 patients)  and including  various  MRI (magnetic  reso- 
nance imaging)  sequences  in the model ( Wang et al., 2020 ). In contrast,  
our study is based on an order of magnitude  larger number  of patients:  
162 [ 11 C]PiB and 509 [ 18 F]FE-PE2I  PET/CT  scans. Furthermore,  our 
models only require  data acquired  at a single PET/CT  acquisition  and 
are thus independent  of secondary  MRI acquisition.  
The purpose  of this study is to investigate  the feasibility  of using 
activity  reduction  in clinical  [ 11 C]PiB and [ 18 F]FE-PE2I  PET/CT  scans 
in combination  with AI-assisted  denoising  of the obtained  brain images.  
Additionally,  we aim to introduce  a single network  architecture  that can 
robustly  learn denoising  of brain images in which the tracer uptake is 
spanning  from localized  to delocalized  distribution.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Patients  
The patient data were divided  into two separate  cohorts  based on 
the two studied  tracers:  [ 11 C]PiB and [ 18 F]FE-PE2I.  The ﬁrst cohort con- 
tained patients  referred  for clinically  uncertain  AD according  to the ap- 
propriate  use criteria  for amyloid  PET imaging  ( Johnson  et al., 2013 ). A 
total of 162 patients  underwent  PET/CT  between  May 2019 and October  
2021. The patients  were between  48 and 88 years old, with a mean age of 68.5 ± 7.7 years old. The second cohort contained  509 patients  re- 
ferred for clinically  uncertain  PD ( Morbelli  et al., 2020 ) and underwent  
PET/CT  between  August 2018 and October  2021. The patients  of this co- 
hort were between  22 and 90 years old, with a mean age of 71.5 ± 10.1 
years old. 
All patients  included  in the dataset gave informed  consent  for imag- 
ing to be performed  as part of their diagnostic  work-up.  This study was 
performed  according  to the Danish legislation  as a quality assurance  
study with permission  from the hospital  administration.  The need for 
explicit  written  consent  was not required  according  to regulations  since 
the study operated  exclusively  on anonymized  retrospective  data. To 
comply  with legal requirements,  all data were fully anonymized  upon 
collection  from the clinical  archives  in compliance  with General  Data 
Protection  Regulation  (GDPR).  
2.2. Imaging  protocols  
For [ 11 C]PiB a 20 min scan was commenced  40 min after tracer ad- 
ministration  (mean activity:  320 ± 79 MBq, range: 150–485  MBq) on a 
Biograph  Vision PET/CT  system (Siemens  Healthineers,  Erlangen,  Ger- 
many), while for [ 18 F]FE-PE2I  a 10 min scan was commenced  30 min 
after tracer administration  (mean activity:  204 ± 12 MBq, range: 180–
255 MBq) on a Biograph  mCT (Siemens  Healthineers,  Erlangen,  Ger- 
many). The Vision PET/CT  system properties  are as follows:  axial ﬁeld- 
of-view  (FOV) is 26 cm and NEMA resolution  full-width-half-maximum  
(FWHM)  1 cm from the center is",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(4936, 4939), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(6387, 6390), match=' 3.'>"

brain activation  patterns  within the sensorimotor  network  speciﬁc  to 
these disorders  are likely present,  possibly  leading  to an intrinsic  senso- 
rimotor  “ﬁngerprint  ”per tremor disorder.  
Tremor  is thought  to be an eﬀect of alterations  within the senso- 
rimotor  network,  where eﬀerent  motor activity  and sensory  feedback  
are tightly linked ( Bucher et al., 1997 ). As yet, it has proven diﬃcult  
to separate  activity  related to voluntary  motor output and sensorimotor  
feedback  mechanisms,  and to pinpoint  a pathological  neuronal  origin. 
Especially  in ET diﬀerentiation  of tremor activity  from normal  senso- 
rimotor  brain activity  is challenging  because  of the co-occurrence  of 
tremor and voluntary  movement  with overlapping  brain networks.  But 
also, in PD during rest tremor,  neuronal  activity  due to aﬀerent  sen- 
sory input and activity  associated  with tremor are not easily diﬀerenti-  
ated. Additionally,  although  previous  studies have led to more insight 
into the pathophysiology  of tremor in both groups,  results are heteroge-  
neous and overlap  ( van der Stouwe  et al., 2020 ). Varying  inclusion  cri- 
teria, including  phenotypical  heterogeneous  groups with possible  diﬀer- 
ent pathophysiology,  especially  in ET, are thought  to play an important  
role in the heterogeneous  results ( Holtbernd  and Shah, 2021 ). Further-  
more, only a very limited number  of studies have directly  compared  
brain activations  between  ET and Parkinsonian  tremor ( Li et al., 2020 ; 
Novaes  et al., 2021 ; Rowland  et al., 2015 ). One reason might be that 
tremor types, namely  action tremor in ET and rest tremor in PD, ham- 
per direct comparison  in a task design. 
To gain insight in the intrinsic  sensorimotor  ﬁngerprints  in tremor 
disorders,  we aimed to separately  identify  the eﬀerent  motor network  
and the aﬀerent  sensory  network  using external  perturbations.  The sen- 
sorimotor  system can be considered  a closed-loop  system.  The closed- 
loop approach  is a well-known  approach  in biomechanics,  helping  
to identify  the dynamics  of the system by using a simpliﬁed-model  
( Schouten  and Mugge,  2018 ). Inside the closed-loop  sensorimotor  sys- 
tem, diﬀerent  feedback  loops of the central nervous  system can be dis- 
tinguished  ( Schouten  and Mugge,  2018 ). External  perturbations  can be 
used to investigate  a closed-loop  system.  This would give the oppor- 
tunity to study the properties  within the sensorimotor  loop. We hy- 
pothesized  that the application  of controlled  external  perturbations  dur- 
ing functional  brain imaging  allows for identiﬁcation  of disease-speciﬁc  
brain activations.  
The current  proof-of-principle  study is to determine  the potential  
of our closed-loop  approach  using a custom-made  MR-compatible  wrist 
manipulator  ( Bode et al., 2017 ; Vlaar et al., 2016 ) during fMRI while 
measuring  (in)voluntary  movement  with electromyography  (EMG).  
First, to validate  our approach,  we studied  healthy  individuals  during 
two conditions  controlled  by the wrist manipulator.  The conditions  in- 
clude an active motor task, thus activating  the sensorimotor  network,  
and a passive  sensory  task, to trigger the sensory  network.  Our second 
aim was to investigate  diﬀerences  in brain activations  related to an ac- 
tive motor task and passive  sensory  perturbation  in ET and PD, and 
compared  to healthy  controls.  Our third aim was to identify  speciﬁc  
tremor-related  regions  per group using EMG to indicate  tremor ﬂuctua-  
tion. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Three groups of participants  (ET, tremor dominant  PD and healthy  
controls)  were included  in this study. The monocenter  study was con- 
ducted at the Amsterdam  UMC, location  Academic  Medical  Center.  All 
participants  were 18 years of age or older and right hand dominant.  The 
ET patients  were diagnosed  according  to criteria  deﬁned  by the Tremor  
Investigation  group ( Bain et al., 2000 ). Eighteen  propranolol-sensitive  
ET patients  were included,  with familial  bilateral  postural  arm tremor.  
Tremor  severity  was assessed  using the TETRAS  scale ( Elble et al., 2012 ). 
Fourteen  PD patients  with rest tremor were included  and were diag- 
nosed without  severe motor ﬂuctuations  and severe dyskinesia,  accord-  ing to the UK Brain Bank Criteria  ( Bain et al., 2000 ). Tremor  severity  
was assessed  using the UPDRS  scale part III ( Goetz et al., 2008 ). All clin- 
ical evaluations  were recorded  on video and scored blindly by an expe- 
rienced  neurologist.  To rule out the eﬀects of medication,  both groups 
were asked to temporarily  stop or reduce anti-tremor  medication  at least 
three days before recording  according  to individualized  schemes.  Fur- 
thermore,  eighteen  healthy  controls  with no history of familial  tremor 
or neurological  disorders  participated.  The study protocol  was approved  
by the medical–ethical  board of the Academic  Medical  Center,  Amster-  
dam, according  to the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Informed  written  consent  
was obtained  from each subject prior to participation.  Seven partici-  
pants (three ET patients,  one PD patient,  and three healthy  controls)  
were excluded  because  of technical  issues, leaving  15 ET patients,  13 
PD patients  and 15 healthy  controls  for ﬁnal analyses.  For more details,  
see Table 1 . 
2.2. Experimental  protocol  
Participants  performed  tasks in the MR scanner  with their right hand. 
The tasks in the MRI were performed  using an MR-compatible  wrist ma- 
nipulator  (details  described  below).  Participants  were asked to hold the 
handle of the manipulator  which was attached  to the scan table ( Fig. 1 ). 
The task included  three conditions:  (1) an active motor (sensorimotor)  
task: an intentional  isometric  motor task performed  by counteracting  
the movement  induced  by the wrist manipulator;  (2) a passive  (sen- 
sory) movement  task undergoing  the movement  induced  by the wrist 
manipulator,  resulting  in mainly sensory  input; and (3) rest, without  any 
wrist movement  or activity.  All tasks were explained,  demonstrated  and 
practiced  before scanning.  During scanning,  instructions  projected  on a 
screen placed behind the scanner  could be seen via a mirror mounted  on 
the head coil. Participants  were presented  visual cues including  a black 
crosshair,  a green circle and a red cross ( Fig. 1 and supplementary  ma- 
terial Fig. 1A). During the active task, participants  were asked to apply 
force on the handle to keep the crosshair  in the circle. During the pas- 
sive task, a red cross appeared  illustrating  that no force was required.  
The conditions  were tested in random  order, in nine blocks and lasted 
30 s each. Before the start of each condition,  an instruction  screen was 
presented  that lasted for ﬁve seconds,  during which the patients  could 
become  accustomed  to the condition.  During the tasks, muscle activity  
via EMG and torque were continuously  monitored  to measure  tremor 
as well as to ensure correct task performance.  The total duration  of the 
recorded  session was 16 min. 
In healthy  controls,  the active motor task is supposed  to mainly acti- 
vate the motor network,  but inevitably,  it will also activate  the sensory  
network  (includes  sensory  feedback).  Passive  movement,  thus without  
intentional  movement  or force, is expected  to mainly activate  the sen- 
sory network  (no intentional  motor output).  Consequently,  the experi- 
ment was set up to identify  sensorimotor  activity  (by comparing  an ac- 
tive motor task to rest), sensory  activity  (by comparing  a passive  task to 
rest), and isolated  motor activity  (by comparing  an active task to a pas- 
sive task). Comparisons  between  groups per contrast  allow for further 
identiﬁcation  of disease-speciﬁc  brain activations.  In addition,  tremor 
was measured  with EMG. A tremor derivative  embedded  in a task de- 
sign as a variable,  helps to pinpoint  brain activations  speciﬁcally  related 
to involuntary  tremor,  as described  previously  ( Buijink  et al., 2015b ; 
Dirkx et al., 2016 ), and explained  in more detail below.

Deep learning  approaches  most commonly  integrate  image and tab- 
ular data naively  by concatenation  of latent feature vectors.  To this end, 
tabular  data is concatenated  with a high-level  image descriptor  pro- 
duced by a CNN, and fed through  the ﬁnal (fully-connected)  layers of 
the network  ( Esmaeilzadeh  et al., 2018; Hao et al., 2019; Kopper  et al., 
2021; Liu et al., 2019; Mobadersany  et al., 2018; Pölsterl  et al., 2020 ). 
This approach  limits the way the image-speciﬁc  part of the network  can 
interact  with the tabular-speciﬁc  part of the network  and vice versa. In- 
stead, we seek an architecture  where tight interaction  between  image 
and tabular  data enables  the network  to truly view image information  
in the context  of the tabular  information,  and a two-way  exchange  of 
information  is initiated.  
In this work, we propose  to fuse information  from a patient’s  3D 
brain MRI and tabular  data via the Dynamic  Aﬃne Feature  Map Trans- 
form (DAFT).  The DAFT dynamically  scales and shifts the feature maps 
in a convolutional  layer via an auxiliary  neural network  that amalga-  
mates image and tabular  information.  It is a generic  module  that can be 
easily incorporated  in any type of CNN to establish  a bidirectional  ex- 
change of information  between  data types. In our extensive  experiments  
on AD diagnosis  and time-to-dementia  analysis,  we compare  the DAFT 
to three unimodal  baselines,  and ﬁve competing  deep neural networks  
that fuse image and tabular  information,  and are evaluated  with two dif- 
ferent backbone  architectures.  The results demonstrate  that DAFT out- 
performs  all competing  methods  by a large margin:  +0.021  balanced  
accuracy  in the AD diagnosis  task, and +0.019  concordance  index in 
the time-to-dementia  task. Finally,  our ablation  study and empirical  ex- 
periments  show that the DAFT is robust to various  architectural  changes  
and leads to improved  prediction  accuracy  over baseline  methods  with- 
out the need of extensive  hyper-parameter  tuning.  
The remainder  of this paper is organized  as follows.  In Section  2 , 
we discuss related work on deep neural networks  to combine  image and 
tabular  data. In Section  3 , we propose  the DAFT for improved  integra-  
tion of image and tabular  data, describe  the data from the Alzheimer’s  
Disease  Neuroimaging  Initiative  used in our experiments,  and present  
our evaluation  scheme.  The results and discussion  of our experimental  
results on AD diagnosis  and time-to-dementia  diagnosis  are presented  
in Section  4 . Finally,  we end with concluding  remarks  in Section  5 . 
2. Related  work 
A straight-forward  way to combine  image and tabular  data is a two 
stage approach  where one ﬁrst trains a CNN on the image data alone, 
and then concatenates  its predictions  or latent representations  with the 
tabular  data to ﬁnally ﬁt a separate  linear model on the combined  fea- 
ture vectors.  The authors  of Li et al. (2019) followed  this approach  to 
fuse information  from brain MRI and routinely  acquired  clinical  mark- 
ers to predict progression  to AD. However,  their two-step  process  does 
not fully utilize the CNN, because  it does not consider  that the learned  
image descriptor  could contain  information  that is redundant  to the tab- 
ular information.  
This motivated  others to propose  end-to-end  models,  where the la- 
tent image representation  is concatenated  with the clinical  information  
before the last fully connected  (FC) layer. Hao et al. (2019) followed  
such an approach  to train a single CNN that fuses histopathology  images,  
genomic  data, and demographics  for survival  prediction.  The works in 
Kopper  et al. (2021) ; Pölsterl  et al. (2020) followed  a similar approach  
to fuse a point cloud representation  of the hippocampus  with clinical  
markers  for time-to-dementia  prediction.  The downside  of such an ap- 
proach is that the tabular  data is limited to a linear contribution  to the 
ﬁnal prediction,  unless non-linearities  are modeled  explicitly  (e.g. via 
B-spline  transformations).  
This issue can be overcome  by replacing  the single FC layer, which 
combines  image and tabular  data, with a multilayer  perceptron  (MLP) 
such that non-linear  relationships  can be learned  implicitly.  Such a 
network  was proposed  by Mobadersany  et al. (2018) to predict over- 
all survival  of patients  diagnosed  with glioma from digital pathol- ogy images and genomic  data, and by Esmaeilzadeh  et al. (2018) ; 
Liu et al. (2019) for AD diagnosis  from brain MRI and clinical  markers.  
A minor modiﬁcation  of this approach  uses an additional  MLP that is 
applied  solely on the tabular  data before concatenation  with the latent 
image representation  ( El-Sappagh  et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Spasov 
et al., 2019 ). However,  adding additional  FC layers increases  the num- 
ber of trainable  parameters  considerably,  which can render the network  
more susceptible  to over-ﬁtting.  During inference,  the tabular  informa-  
tion only interacts  with the global image descriptor  in concatenation-  
based approaches,  which does not allow for ﬁne-grained  interactions  on 
the voxel- or patch level. To our assumption,  interactions  on the voxel- 
or patch level improve  the quality of image-features,  which is evident  
from our results.  
Braman  et al. (2021) proposed  to tackle aforementioned  issues by 
fusing latent representations  of three deep modality-speciﬁc  subnet-  
works via an attention-gated  tensor fusion process,  and applying  a 
penalty  term that encourages  the modality-speciﬁc  latent representa-  
tions to be orthogonal.  They fuse MRI, histopathology  images,  genomic  
data, and clinical  information  to predict overall survival  of glioma pa- 
tients. Duanmu  et al. (2020) proposed  an alternative  approach.  They 
fuse information  in a multiplicative  manner  to predict response  to 
chemotherapy.  Their approach  uses an auxiliary  network  that takes the 
tabular  data and outputs  a scalar scaling factor to rescale the feature 
maps of every other convolutional  layer of a CNN. This results in an 
ampliﬁcation  or repression  of latent image feature maps that is con- 
ditional  on the patient’s  tabular  information.  However,  the size of their 
auxiliary  network  scales quadratically  with the depth of the CNN, which 
in turn increases  the runtime  and memory  requirements  dramatically.  
Perez et al. (2018) introduced  the Feature-wise  Linear Modulation  
(FiLM) layer for visual question  answering  in computer  vision. Similar  
to the work by Duanmu  et al. (2020) , FiLM uses an auxiliary  network,  
but in addition  to the scaling factor, also outputs  an oﬀset to shift feature 
maps by. Therefore,  the auxiliary  network  in FiLM can aﬃnely  trans- 
form each feature map of a convolutional  layer, similar to our approach.  
The only application  of FiLM to the medical  domain  was presented  in 
Jacenków  et al. (2020) to segment  the myocardium  and ventricular  cav- 
ities conditional  on the slice position  and the phase of the cardiac  cycle. 
Note that the premise  of the two approaches  above is very diﬀerent  from 
ours. In visual question  answering  and image segmentation,  the meta 
information  (question  or cardiac  cycle) is fundamentally  related to the 
image content,  because  in both settings  the meta information  refers to 
a property  of the image. Therefore,  conditioning  the CNN on the meta 
information,  but not vice versa, is a reasonable  approach.  In contrast,  in 
our work, the interrelation  of image and tabular  data is much weaker,  
which is why we argue that a bidirectional  ﬂow of information  is pre- 
ferred. In the proposed  DAFT, feature maps are scaled and shifted,  as 
in FiLM ( Perez et al., 2018 ), but we make this transformation  condi- 
tional on image and tabular  data such that one source of information  
can inform the other. 
A preliminary  version  of this work has been presented  at a conference  
( Pölsterl  et al., 2021 ). Here, we extend this work by providing  more de- 
tails on the technical  aspects  of DAFT, and extending  the experimental  
evaluation  with more metrics,  an analysis  of the contribution  of indi- 
vidual tabular  features  on the predictive  performance,  and additional  
experiments  to showcase  that DAFT generalizes  better than previous  
approaches.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5279, 5282), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8800, 8805), match='  \n3.'>"

spatial pattern  of brain activity  obviate  these challenges.  Inter-subject  
correlation  (ISC, Hasson  et al., 2004 ) is one such data-driven  approach  
for characterizing  the consistency  of brain responses  across participants  
viewing  the same naturalistic  stimuli.  For dynamic  complex  stimuli 
such as movies,  ISC measures  share information  across brains by us- 
ing each individual’s  measured  brain activity  to model another  indi- 
vidual’s  brain activity.  Using this strategy,  the shared brain regions  
that respond  to the same time-locked  naturalistic  stimuli across sub- 
jects can be estimated,  even with stimuli that reﬂect complex  dynamic  
real-life  contexts  ( Hasson  et al., 2004 ; Kauppi et al., 2014 ; Lerner et al., 
2011 ; Nastase  et al., 2019 ). Modiﬁcations  to ISC include  the temporal  
inter-subject  functional  correlation  (ISFC), which considers  the correla-  
tions between  time courses  from all possible  pair-wise  combinations  of 
brain parcels across subjects  ( Simony  et al., 2016 ), and the spatial ISC, 
which is an extension  of temporal  ISC to multi-voxel  pattern  analysis  
( Haxby et al., 2014 ; Norman  et al., 2006 ). 
Inter-subject  representational  similarity  analysis  (IS-RSA)  is another  
technique  that can be used to explore  between-subject  variability  in the 
relationships  between  brain activity  and behaviors  ( Finn et al., 2020 ; 
Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008 ; Mantel,  1967 ; Meer et al., 2020 ). Van der Meer 
and colleagues  (2020) explored  the diﬀerences  between  movie viewing  
and resting state with Hidden  Markov  Models  (HMM)  and found that 
subject diﬀerences  in brain state dynamics  were linked to subjective  
movie ratings using IS-RSA.  Through  the study of between-subject  vari- 
ability, diﬀerent  schematic  events ( Baldassano  et al., 2018 ) and diﬀerent  
conditions  when participants  recall a movie ( Chen et al., 2017 , 2016 ) 
can be distinguished  via the corresponding  brain activity.  In most cases, 
understanding  patterns  of brain states that are consistent  across subjects  
as well as patterns  that reﬂect inter-subject  variability  are of interest.  In 
this study, we leverage  a popular  tensor decomposition  method  to si- 
multaneously  estimate  spatial-temporal  brain activity  patterns  that are 
shared across participants  and that reﬂect inter-subject  variability.  
Generally,  ISC-based  methods  are implemented  with either a leave- 
one-out  framework,  in which one subject’s  time course is correlated  with 
the average  of all other subjects  for each region, or a pairwise  frame- 
work, in which correlation  analysis  is performed  between  each possible  
pair of subjects  ( Finn et al., 2020 ). A limitation  of this computational  
procedure  is that the resulting  correlations  are highly interdependent  
and violate the assumption  of common  parametric  tests ( Nastase  et al., 
2019 ), requiring  careful attention  to the inference  method.  In order 
to mitigate  this limitation,  we use a tensor component  analysis  (TCA) 
framework  that characterizes  spatio-temporal  patterns  that are shared 
across subjects  as well as idiosyncratic  features  of evoked  activity  to 
naturalistic  stimuli unique to diﬀerent  subjects,  in a purely data-driven  
manner  that assesses  all brain networks  simultaneously.  
Tensor Component  Analysis  (TCA), also known as tensor Canonical  
Polyadic  Decomposition  (CPD, Kolda and Bader, 2009 ), is a fundamen-  
tal model for tensor decomposition  of multidimensional  data with more 
than two dimensions.  Assuming  the data meet the assumption  of a mix- 
ture model, in which signal sources  undergo  a linear mixing process,  
TCA more accurately  estimates  sources  than matrix decomposition  algo- 
rithms, and without  any constraints  ( Williams  et al., 2018 ). FMRI signals 
are innately  multidimensional  and can be naturally  represented  in ten- 
sor form. For example,  a third-order  fMRI tensor is organized  as space ×
time ×subjects  (the order of modes does not impact the estimation).  In 
TCA of the fMRI tensor, the spatial and temporal  information  regarding  
brain network  activity  evoked  by diﬀerent  stimuli that is common  to 
all participants  exists in the ﬁrst two dimensions.  Subject  loadings  that 
capture  between-subject  variability  exist in the third dimension.  
TCA has demonstrated  promise  in a range of neuroimaging  appli- 
cations.  It has been shown to have superior  performance  in identify-  
ing hidden signal sources  when compared  with 2-D matrix decomposi-  
tion, e.g. principle  component  analysis  (PCA) and independent  compo-  
nent analysis  (ICA), of multidimensional  data ( Williams  et al., 2018 ). 
TCA has also been explored  for magnetoencephalography  (MEG) data 
analysis  ( Zhu et al., 2020 a), and nonnegative  constraint  TCA applied  to electroencephalography  (EEG) time-frequency  domain  data was able to 
identify  event-related  ( Cong et al., 2015a , 2015b ; Wang et al., 2018 ) 
and naturalistic  stimulus-evoked  EEG responses  ( Zhu et al., 2020 b). 
Mokhtari  et al. (2019) investigated  how diﬀerent  tensor organiza-  
tion and tensor decomposition  methods  applied  to fMRI data impact 
the interpretation  of dynamic  functional  connectivity.  In our previous  
study ( Hu et al., 2021 ), sparse constrained  nonnegative  TCA was pro- 
posed to estimate  frequency  speciﬁc  coactivation  patterns.  TCA has 
also been applied  to task fMRI data to explore  additional  dimensions  
of the data other than space and time, such as run and task condition  
( Andersen  and Rayens,  2004 ), and has been adapted  for multi-subject  
fMRI data analysis  by placing  spatial and temporal  constraints  to ad- 
dress inter-subject  variability  ( Beckmann  and Smith, 2005 ; Helwig and 
Hong, 2013 ; Kuang et al., 2020 , 2015 ; Mørup et al., 2008 ; Zhou and Ci- 
chocki,  2012 ). We advance  TCA for analysis  of multi-subject  fMRI data 
collected  during naturalistic  stimuli viewing  by proposing  a pipeline  that 
does not place any constraints  on the data and that enhances  the repro- 
ducibility  of the results.  
We address  three key issues that have limited the use of tensor de- 
composition  for naturalistic  stimuli fMRI ( Wolf et al., 2010 ). First, the 
TCA algorithm  may be slow or fail to converge,  or have suboptimal  con- 
vergence  when applied  to whole brain data. To mitigate  this issue, the 
TCA is usually  constrained  in some way ( Beckmann  and Smith, 2005 ; 
Zhou et al., 2014 ). Instead  of constraining  the TCA algorithm,  we pro- 
pose instead  to implement  a parcellation  strategy  to reduce the data 
prior to TCA to facilitate  convergence.  Second,  we propose  a novel ten- 
sor spectral  clustering  method  to enhance  the reproducibility  of the esti- 
mated components.  Last, model order selection  is always a challenge  for 
tensor and matrix decomposition  methods  ( Abou-Elseoud  et al., 2010 ; 
Beckmann,  2012 ; Kuang et al., 2018 ). Here we propose  to select the 
model order based on component  reproducibility  assessed  via our novel 
spectral  clustering  method.  The eﬀectiveness  of the proposed  framework  
is ﬁrst demonstrated  with simulated  and traditional  task fMRI, in which 
we know the ground  truth stimulation  time courses  (and hence have a 
model of the brain activity).  We then apply the proposed  framework  to 
fMRI data collected  during movie watching,  in which there is no a pri- 
ori model of brain activity,  to identify  spatial brain networks  engaged  
during the task. Analysis  of both task fMRI and naturalistic  stimuli fMRI 
results show that the proposed  method  has several advantages  compared  
with the widely used ISC method.  
The rest of the paper is structured  as follows.  In section 2 , Mate- 
rials and Methods,  we present  the TCA model that was used to esti- 
mate spatio-temporal  shared components,  e.g., the decomposition  al- 
gorithm  used in this paper, the criteria  that were used to evaluate  the 
reproducibility  of estimated  components  and the model order selection  
method,  and the test datasets.  In section 3 , Results,  we show results us- 
ing simulated  data and motor task fMRI. After establishing  the robust- 
ness of the proposed  framework  from simulations  and conventional  task 
fMRI, we show results from application  of our analytic  approach  to two 
diﬀerent  naturalistic  stimuli fMRI datasets:  one in which participants  
watched  a short 82 second montage  of scenes, collected  from 184 par- 
ticipants  by the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP), and one in which 
participants  watched  a longer movie (20 minutes),  collected  from 17 
participants  by Meer et al. (2020) . In sections  4 and 5 , the Discussion  
and Conclusions,  respectively,  we discuss the beneﬁts  and pitfalls of our 
proposed  approach  and the conclusions  from our work. The mathemati-  
cal foundation  of tensor spectral  clustering  used to evaluate  the stability  
of estimated  components  is provided  in the Appendix.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. TCA model 
Our proposed  application  of TCA of naturalistic  stimuli fMRI data 
proceeds  in three steps as shown in Fig. 1 . First, a data reduction  step is 
introduced  in which the activity  of node (or region)  time courses  is ex-

tracted from the naturalistic  stimuli fMRI data using an open-access  par- 
cellation  scheme  derived  from independent  component  analysis  (ICA) 
of resting state fMRI; next, the time courses  from all participants  are 
stacked  to construct  a third-order  fMRI tensor; last, TCA is applied  to 
estimate  spatio-temporal  patterns  and their corresponding  subject load- 
ings. 
In the ﬁrst step, rather than applying  TCA to voxel-wise  fMRI data, a 
whole brain parcellation  scheme  is applied  to extract node time courses  
for the TCA. This is done for several reasons.  First, BOLD signals are 
expected  to be correlated  across neighboring  voxels and, with an ap- 
propriate  parcellation  method,  node time courses  will have a higher 
signal noise ratio (SNR) compared  with the SNR of time courses  from 
dense data ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). Parcellation  schemes  based on ICA of 
fMRI data with high model orders ( > 100 to several hundred)  will be comprised  of components  that feature individual  small brain regions,  
bilateral  brain regions,  or sparse sub-networks  that may have regions  
overlapping  other components  (e.g., reﬂecting  hubs such as posterior  
cingulate  cortex),  and can thus be considered  as nodes for use in net- 
work analysis  ( Smith, 2012 ). Several  studies have demonstrated  that 
brain parcellation  with spatial ICA demonstrates  better performance  for 
network  modeling  compared  with other parcellation  methods  (Smith 
et al., 2011; Arslan et al., 2018), with higher model orders providing  
better performance  ( Pervaiz  et al., 2020 ). In this study, a brain par- 
cellation  scheme  derived  from ICA of the Human  Connectome  Project 
(HCP, Van Essen et al., (2013) ) resting state fMRI data with model or- 
der of 300 (provided  by the HCP, Smith et al., 2011) is used to ex- 
tract node time courses  for TCA. The time courses  are extracted  via 
the ﬁrst stage of dual regression  ( Nickerson  et al., 2017 ) in which the 
3  G. Hu, H. Li, W. Zhao et al. NeuroImage  255 (2022) 119193 
full set of ICA components,  𝐒 ICA , are regressed  against  each partici-  
pant’s 4D fMRI data (e.g., multivariate  spatial regression)  to extract the 
time courses.  This is diﬀerent  from how conventional  binary parcella-  
tion masks are used to extract average  time courses  from each node 
in that the multivariate  spatial regression  accurately  handles  any po- 
tential spatial overlap  among the ICA maps due to individual  brain re- 
gions participating  in more than one brain network  (or sub-network)  
represented  in the ICA maps. The analysis  code for the tensor compo-

2.1.1. Multilinear  mixing model 
For naturalistic  fMRI we assume,  similar to the ISC model ( Finn et al., 
2020 ; Nastase  et al., 2019 ), that time courses  𝐂 ∈ℝ N ×J and spatial 
patterns  𝐒 ∈ℝ M ×J of nodes in the parcellation  are stimulus-evoked  re- 
sponses  that are consistent  across subject.  N is the number  of timepoints,  
J is the number  of patterns,  M is the number  of nodes. Thus, in our TCA- 
based model, for each pattern  𝑗, the loading  𝝈𝑖,𝑗 for subject 𝑖 is diﬀerent  
from other subjects.  In this case, for subject 𝑖 , the node time courses,  
𝐗 𝑖 ∈ℝ M ×N , can be represented  as: 
𝐗 𝑖 = 𝐒 ×𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠 (𝝈𝑖, ∶ )×𝐂 𝑇 + 𝐈 𝐝 𝑖 + 𝜺 𝑖 , (1) 
where 𝐈 𝐝 𝑖 are stimulus-evoked  responses  that are idiosyncratic  to each 
subject and 𝜺 𝑖 corresponds  to noise, which may reﬂect spontaneous  neu- 
ral activity  and non-neural  physiological  and scanner  signal sources.  
𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠 ( 𝝈𝑖, ∶ ) is a square matrix of order J with 𝝈𝑖, ∶ on the diagonal  and 
other elements  of the matrix equal to zero. 
2.1.2. Tensor construction  
A tensor is constructed  by stacking  the multi-subject  data, 𝐗 𝑖 , to cre- 
ate 𝐗 ∈ℝ M ×I ×N , with I equal to the total number  of subjects.  Although  
the spatial and temporal  patterns  are assumed  to be shared across partic- 
ipants, the loadings  on the components  in each participant  are diﬀerent.  
Of note, the model also does not place any assumptions  on the distribu-  
tion of time courses  or spatial distributions.

One key motivation  for the proposed  pipeline  is to facilitate  open 
science  with the larger aim of improving  the replicability  of MEG re- 
search. If diﬀerent  approaches  are used to address  similar questions,  this 
might hamper  reproducibility.  Also, when research  is published,  there 
is a great variation  in details provided  in the method  section.  Relying  
on a standard  pipeline  will make it simpler  to describe  the methodol-  
ogy and therefore  facilitate  future research  building  on the published  
ﬁndings.  Pre-registrations  are becoming  increasingly  important  for em- 
pirical research  ( Shrout and Rodgers,  2018 ); however,  they can be quite 
cumbersome  due to the necessity  of deﬁning  the analysis  details before 
the study. The proposed  FLUX pipeline  will help this process  and lower 
the threshold  when researchers  decide to pre-register  a given study. The 
FLUX pipeline  will also provide  concrete  parameter  settings  and text 
suggestions  to be included  in the Method  sections  of publication  and 
pre-registrations  (see Supplementary  Material).  Finally,  we also provide  
a standard  operation  procedure  (SOP) for the recording  of MEG data. 
This will further facilitate  pre-registrations  as well as promote  standard-  
ization across laboratories.  
Over the years several guidelines  and recommendations  for MEG re- 
search have been published.  The FLUX pipeline  we are proposing  is well 
aligned  with the suggestions  on pre-preprocessing  and basic analyses  
as outlined  in various  papers (Andersen,  2018 ; Bigdely-Shamlo  et al., 
2015 ; Meunier  et al., 2020 Meunier  et al., 2020; Niso et al., 2019) ) as 
well as the guidelines  described  to ensure reproducible  MEG research  
( Gross et al., 2013 ; Hari et al., 2018 ; Pernet et al., 2020 ). In terms 
of source modelling  our approach  is consistent  with the guidance  for 
forward  modelling  and beamforming  described  in recent publications  
( Jaiswal  et al., 2020 ; Jas et al., 2018 ; Westner  et al., 2021 ). What we pro- 
vide in addition  to these papers is a speciﬁc  pipeline  with documented  
code taking the raw data to sources  analysis.  We also provide  concrete  
suggestions  for what to report in publications  and registered  reports.  
The FLUX pipeline  is implemented  as speciﬁc  code with documented  tu- 
torials and an example  data set ( https://neuosc.com/ﬂux/  ). We ﬁnd it 
important  to deﬁne a full pipeline  including  as the pre-processing  strat- 
egy will impact the details of the subsequent  analyses.  For instance,  the 
rank deduction  resulting  from signal-space  suppression  impacts  the pa- 
rameters  used in the source modelling.  
There is a strong trend towards  acquiring  large datasets  in cogni- 
tive and clinical  neuroscience  collected  over multiple  sites ( Niso et al., 
2016 ; Poldrack  and Gorgolewski,  2014 ). The FLUX pipeline  is devel- 
oped as part of the Cogitate  Consortium  and it is based on an adversar-  
ial collaboration  investigation  conscious  by collecting  a large data set 
( Melloni  et al., 2021 ). The consortium  is developed  in the context  of 
open science  with the aim of acquiring  high-quality  data using state-of-  
the-art analyses  approach.  The FLUX pipeline  is derived  from the best 
practice  developed  in the Cogitate  Consortium.  As learned  from the con- 
sortium,  eﬀorts on big data as well as cross-group  collaborations  will 
beneﬁt from the FLUX pipeline  as it will provide  a standard  analysis  ap- 
proach that can be used across sites. In the FLUX pipeline  we will make 
explicit  which analysis  steps can be done automatically  and which re- 
quire visual inspection  and interactions  of the data. These steps will 
facilitate  the development  of a fully automated  pipeline  beneﬁtting  the 
analysis  of large datasets.  
Finally,  education  is an important  motivation  for the FLUX pipeline.  
The research  ﬁeld of MEG is constantly  growing  as more systems  are 
being installed  around the world. Moreover,  the advent of OPM-MEG  
systems  ( Boto et al., 2018 ; Hill et al., 2019 ) is thought  to be less ex- 
pensive  and more versatile  catalysing  an even faster expansion  on the 
number  of MEG laboratories.  In parallel,  there is a strong push to share 
already  recorded  MEG data ( Niso et al., 2016 ) meaning  that a wider 
group of researchers  will be able to analyse  existing  datasets.  In sum, 
these developments  will result in an inﬂux of researchers  that need to 
be trained  in MEG analysis.  We have therefore  made the FLUX pipeline  
available  to the community  via a GitHub  repository  ( https://github.  
com/Neuronal-Oscillations/FLUX/  ) organized  in an open access website  
( https://neuosc.com/ﬂux/  ) together  with an example  dataset.  To facil- itate the integration  with education,  the FLUX pipeline  is implemented  
and shared through  Jupyter  notebooks  for MNE-Python  and Matlab Live 
Editor for the FieldTrip  toolbox.  
2. Approach  
2.1. The FLUX pipeline  provided  via Jupyter notebooks  and Matlab Live 
Editor 
The FLUX pipelines  have been developed  using MNE-Python  
( Gramfort,  2013 ) and FieldTrip  ( Oostenveld  et al., 2011 ) which are 
open-source  toolboxes  implemented  in Python and Matlab,  respec- 
tively. Both toolboxes  are widely used by the MEG community.  
There are other excellent  toolboxes  such as BrainStorm  ( Tadel et al., 
2011 ), SPM ( Litvak et al., 2011 ) and NUTMEG  ( Hinkley  et al., 2020 ) 
and the FLUX pipeline  could be expanded  in the future to include  
those as well. The FLUX pipelines  can be accessed  via a website  
( https://neuosc.com/ﬂux/  ) and the scripts themselves  are maintained  
on a GitHub  repository  ( https://github.com/Neuronal-Oscillations/  
FLUX/ ). While the pipeline  will evolve with time, the aim is to keep 
it fairly constrained  and have basic functionality  relatively  static albeit 
subject to reﬁnements.  With time, new sections  will be included  to add 
functionalities.  The pipeline  for MNE Python is deﬁned  using Jupyter  
notebooks  as this allows for easy integration  of the code in combination  
with descriptions,  as well as textual and graphical  outputs.  The FieldTrip  
pipeline  is deﬁned  using the Matlab Live Editor for the same reasons.  
The code from the notebooks  can be copied and integrated  into standard  
scripts. 
2.2. The dataset 
To demonstrate  the functionality  of the pipeline  we will be using 
an MEG dataset based on a spatial attention  paradigm  ( Fig. 1 ). The 
paradigm  is derived  from a study involving  moving  gratings  and the 
detection  of subtle dots (based on; see also Hoogenboom  et al., 2006 ). 
The dataset was recorded  using the MEGIN  Triux system at the MEG fa- 
cility of the Centre for Human  Brain Health,  University  of Birmingham,  
UK. Each trial in the paradigm  started with a ﬁxation  dot followed  by a 
cue pointing  either to the left or right. This indicated  to the participants  
which of the two upcoming  stimuli to attend. After a 1 s inter-stimulus  
interval,  two inward moving  circular  gratings  were shown in both hemi- 
ﬁelds. After a random  interval  (1–",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5345, 5348), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(7512, 7514), match='3.'>"

Publicly  available  MRI resources  ( Majka et al., 2020 ; Fox et al., 2021 ; 
Milham  et al., 2020 ; Liu, 2018 ; Hayashi  et al., 2021 ; Van Essen et al., 
2013 ) have been tremendously  useful and generally  welcomed  by sci- 
entiﬁc stakeholders  ( Milham,  2020, 2022 ). Because  MRI is a relatively  
expensive  technique,  data sharing  allows for high-powered  population-  
level analyses  that may otherwise  not be feasible.  Human  projects,  such 
as the Human  Connectome  Project,  have exempliﬁed  the beneﬁts  of 
open data and set essential  standards  for consistent  and optimized  data 
acquisitions  ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). Similarly,  the PRIMatE  data Exchange  
(PRIME-DE  ( Milham,  2022 )) is making  great strides in developing  sim- 
ilar strategies  for nonhuman  primate  data ( Hayashi  et al., 2021 ). These 
strategic  initiatives  are suitably  coupled  with initiatives  for standard-  
ized data sharing,  such as the Brain Imaging  Data Structure  (BIDS) for- 
mating for online repositories  ( Gorgolewski  et al., 2016 ). Data sharing  
reduces  the burden of animal use, including  not only the cost and logis- 
tics of housing  but, most importantly,  the requisite  number  of animals  
needed  to participate  in research.  Concomitant  with these beneﬁts,  such 
resources  make data available  to institutions  without  preclinical  neu- 
roimaging  facilities  or the broad expertise  required  to develop  and im- 
plement  nonhuman  primate  imaging  protocols.  Data sharing  has been 
essential  for enabling  cross-species  comparisons,  allowing  researchers  
to more readily realize the translational  value of their data with refer- 
ence to the human brain or other phylogenetically  similar species ( Hori 
et al., 2021; Schaeﬀer,  2020a ; Balsters  et al., 2019 ; Buckner  and Mar- 
gulies, 2019 ). 
Despite  considerable  interest  in acquiring  neuroimaging  data in mar- 
mosets ( Miller et al., 2016 ), there are currently  only a few institu- 
tions worldwide  equipped  to conduct  large-scale  fMRI studies in fully 
awake marmosets.  This scarcity  is partly due to the encumbrance  of 
developing  custom  hardware  (e.g., radiofrequency  and gradient  coils) 
( Peterson  et al., 2018 ; Gilbert et al., 2019 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2019 ; 
Papoti et al., 2017 ) to achieve  high-quality,  accelerated  MRI acquisi-  
tions, as marmoset-speciﬁc  imaging  hardware  for high-ﬁeld  preclini-  
cal MRI systems  is not widely available  commercially.  Further,  with 
confounding  eﬀects of canonical  anesthetic  agents (e.g., isoﬂurane)  on 
the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent  (BOLD)  signal, it is preferable  to 
collect fMRI data in fully awake marmosets  ( Hori et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 
2013 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2019 ; Hung et al., 2015a ; Hung et al., 2015b ; 
Tian et al., 2021 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2020 ). The painstaking  work of ac- 
climating  marmosets  to tolerate  being awake in the MRI environment  
and developing  means to ameliorate  head motion are other signiﬁcant  
hurdles  for researchers  interested  in performing  marmoset  fMRI stud- 
ies. Because  our group and others have already  met these challenges,  
we aim to accelerate  progress  in the ﬁeld by making  our data and the 
means to collect it (e.g., training  procedures,  hardware  designs)  publicly  
available  ( Gilbert et al., 2019 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2019 ; Papoti et al., 2017 ; 
Silva et al., 2011 ). With the advent of 3D printing,  the low-volume  pro- 
duction  of marmoset-speciﬁc  apparatuses  is becoming  increasingly  fea- 
sible for institutions  without  in-house  machining,  avoiding  the cost and 
wait associated  with outsourcing.  
To promote  progress  in understanding  the functional  organization  of 
the marmoset  brain, we present  a resource  that allows for online viewing  
and download  of three-dimensional  functional  connectivity  (FC) maps 
from over 70 h of RS-fMRI  collected  at ultra-high  ﬁeld from 31 fully 
awake adult marmosets:  marmosetbrainconnectome.org  . Importantly,  
researchers  can use this resource  to test hypotheses  about FC directly  –
with no additional  analyses  required  –yielding  whole-brain  correlations  
for any gray matter voxel on demand.  We demonstrate  the resource’s  
utility for presurgical  planning  and comparison  with tracer-based  struc- 
tural connectivity  as proof of concept.  Further,  we illustrate  the distinct  
advantages  of the Marmoset  Functional  Connectivity  Resource,  com- 
plementing  existing  structural  connectivity  resources  for the marmoset  
brain. We demonstrate  that the connectivity  can vary widely even within 
a cytoarchitectonically  well-deﬁned  region (e.g., area TE3). Note that 
neural tracer connectivity  resources  use a cartesian  grid system to plot 
injections  across the cortex and provide  no subcortical  data ( Majka et al., 2020 ). Our comprehensive  RS-fMRI-based  whole-brain  connectivity  re- 
source overcomes  these limitations  by allowing  the user to interrogate  
and examine  the FC of any brain voxel –cortical  or subcortical  –ﬁlling  
critical gaps across the brain where neuronal  tracer injections  are un- 
available.  With the entire raw database  (RS-fMRI  and structural  images)  
and preprocessing  code for 31 marmosets  openly available  for down- 
load and use, we expect this resource  to be broadly  valuable  to test 
novel hypotheses  about the functional  organization  of the marmoset  
brain. Connectivity  maps can be instantaneously  loaded at the group 
level or for individual  marmosets  to cater to various  neuroscientiﬁc  in- 
quiries.  To integrate  this resource  seamlessly  with existing  marmoset  
resources,  we have included  three atlases (in both volume  and surface 
space) ( Hikishima  et al., 2011 ; Liu, 2018 ; Paxinos  et al., 2012 ) onto 
which the FC topologies  can be projected.  Finally,  we present  a new 
ultra-high-resolution  marmoset  anatomical  template  at 25 μm isotropic  
resolution.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Animals  
Thirty-one  adult marmosets  ( Callithrix  jacchus ) from two separate  
collection  sites contributed  data to this resource:  5 marmosets  from the 
University  of Western  Ontario  (UWO) and 26 marmosets  acquired  at the 
National  Institutes  of Health (NIH) ( Table 1 ). For the UWO data, all ﬁve 
marmosets  underwent  an aseptic surgical  procedure  to implant  an MRI- 
compatible  head chamber;  note that this plastic chamber  was explicitly  
designed  to avoid magnetic  susceptibility  artifacts  for MRI acquisitions  
( Johnston  et al., 2018 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2019 ). For the NIH data, a non- 
invasive  custom-formed  head holder was 3D printed  and aﬃxed to the 
animal bed ( Papoti et al., 2013 ). Experimental  procedures  were per the 
Canadian  Council  of Animal  Care policy and a protocol  approved  by the 
Animal  Care Committee  of the University  of Western  Ontario  Council  
on Animal  Care (UWO data) and Animal  Care and Use Committee  of 
the National  Institute  of Neurological  Disorders  and Stroke, National  
Institutes  of Health (NIH data). 
2.2. Acclimatization  to the MRI environment  
Marmosets  at both UWO and NIH underwent  the same acclimati-  
zation training  for awake MRI ( Silva et al., 2011 ). Brieﬂy,  marmosets  
were trained  over several weeks, advancing  across three phases of ac- 
climatization,  progressing  to the subsequent  training  phase based on the 
animal’s  behavior.  Animals  only progressed  to the subsequent  training  
phase if they received  a behavioral  rating score of < 2 (see behavioral  
rating scale ( Silva et al., 2011 )), showing  little sign of agitation  across 
the training  period. During the ﬁrst phase, the marmosets  were acclima-  
tized to body restraint  only (i.e., not head restrained)  for increasingly  
long periods,  starting  at 15 min and progressing  up to an hour in the 
course of a week. The marmosets  were rewarded  (e.g., banana  pudding,  
mini-marshmallows)  at the start and end of the training  session.  Dur- 
ing the second phase, the animals  were inserted  into a mock MRI tube 
(i.e., the same diameter  as the scanner  bore being used) while being 
restrained  as described  in phase 1. With MRI being an extremely  loud 
technique  (e.g., 125 + dB for an fMRI sequence  at 9.4 Tesla), it is nec- 
essary to also acclimate  the animal to the periodic  sounds of the MRI; 
recorded  versions  of the sounds were played at increasingly  loud vol- 
umes, and for increasingly  long durations.  Once the performance  was 
satisfactory  for phase 2, the animals  proceeded  to phase 3, combining  
phase 1 (body restraint)  and 2 (sounds  in the mock MRI), but with the 
addition  of head ﬁxation  for increasingly  long periods.  By the end of 
phase 3, the marmosets  were suﬃciently  acclimatized  to the restraint  
system and proceeded  to awake MRI acquisitions  with minimal  stress. 
With few exceptions,  the total duration  of training  was three weeks, 
with each phase lasting one week. For a few animals,  additional  time 
(one week at most) was taken for acclimation  to phase 1.

2010 ), use of young adult T 1 w and DTI templates  in studies of older 
adults increases  spatial mismatch  across individuals,  and reduces  the 
sensitivity  and accuracy  of analyses  ( Fonov et al., 2011 ; Good et al., 
2001 ; Ridwan  et al., 2021 ; Senjem  et al., 2005 ; Van Hecke et al., 2011 ; 
Yoon et al., 2009 ). There is therefore  a need for multimodal  T 1 w and 
DTI templates  of the older adult brain. 
A number  of approaches  have been used previously  to construct  mul- 
timodal  T 1 w and DTI templates,  and these approaches  can be grouped  
into those that construct  templates:  a) in series e.g. ﬁrst T 1 w and then 
DTI, or the opposite,  and b) in parallel.  In the ﬁrst category,  previous  
work constructed  a T 1 w template  from data on multiple  individuals  and 
applied  the resulting  transformations  to diﬀusion  tensor-derived  data 
which were then averaged  to build corresponding  templates  (e.g. frac- 
tional anisotropy  and mean diﬀusivity  templates)  ( Rohlﬁng  et al., 2010 ). 
This approach  ensured  excellent  matching  between  the resulting  T 1 w 
and DTI templates.  However,  an important  limitation  was that the spa- 
tial transformations  that match T 1 w data across multiple  individuals  
do not ensure optimal  matching  of DTI data from the same individu-  
als, because  in T 1 w images most of the contrast  is located  at the cor- 
tex and subcortical  structures  and there is limited information  to guide 
registration  in the white matter where most of the DTI contrast  is lo- 
cated, thereby  lowering  the quality of the DTI template  ( Zhang and 
Arfanakis,  2018 ). Similarly,  other work registered  average  diﬀusion-  
weighted  images from multiple  individuals  to the previously  constructed  
ICBM-152  T 1 w template  ( Mazziotta  et al., 1995 ) and applied  those trans- 
formations  to the diﬀusion  tensor data, which were then averaged  to 
construct  a DTI template  in ICBM-152  space ( Mori et al., 2008 ). Again, 
the main limitation  was that spatial matching  of DTI data across indi- 
viduals  was not optimized,  reducing  the quality of the DTI template  
( Peng et al., 2009 ). Hsu et al., 2015 , recognized  this limitation  and 
following  T 1 w-based  alignment  of diﬀusion  imaging  data to ICBM-152  
space ( Mazziotta  et al., 1995 ) and construction  of a temporary  diﬀu- 
sion spectrum  imaging  (DSI) template,  performed  additional  DSI-based  
registrations  to improve  DSI matching  across individuals  and generated  
an improved  DSI template.  However,  one limitation  of this approach  
was that since the DSI-based  registrations  occurred  after the T 1 w reg- 
istrations  had been completed,  the space of the ﬁnal DSI template  may 
have deviated  slightly  from the space of the T 1 w template.  Another  lim- 
itation was that the two templates  were based on data from diﬀerent  
groups of people having diﬀerent  characteristics  which may have lim- 
ited the spatial matching  across templates,  and even in regions  with ap- 
parently  good matching,  the combination  of T 1 w and DSI characteristics  
may not be representative  of the human brain. In brief, previous  work 
constructing  multimodal  T 1 w and DTI templates  in series was able to ei- 
ther optimize  template  matching  across modalities  and template  quality 
for only one modality  at the cost of low template  quality for the other 
modality,  or to optimize  template  quality for both modalities  separately  
at the cost of reduced  template  matching  across modalities.  
To address  the above limitations,  multimodal  templates  can be con- 
structed  in parallel  using multichannel  registration  ( Arthofer  et al., 
2021 ; Avants et al., 2008a ; Guimond  et al., 2002 ; Irfanoglu  et al., 2016 ; 
Lange et al., 2020b ; Li and Verma,  2011 ; Park et al., 2003 ). Multi- 
channel  registration  estimates  a joint deformation  that aims to optimize  
inter-subject  spatial matching  for all modalities,  thereby  ensuring  both 
high template  quality and excellent  template  matching  across modal- 
ities. However,  although  this approach  may work well when building  
multimodal  T 1 w and T 2 w templates  which have similar features,  most 
of the contrast  in T 1 w images is in gray matter while most of the con- 
trast in DTI is in white matter,  and therefore  T 1 w information  may be 
distracting  when attempting  to optimize  inter-subject  matching  of DTI features,  and the opposite  (the severity  of this problem  also depends  on 
the registration  algorithm).  We argue that the requirement  for simulta-  
neous optimization  of inter-subject  spatial matching  in both T 1 w and 
DTI data may lead to less precise spatial matching  of the features  of 
interest  in each modality  compared  to considering  each modality  sepa- 
rately, thereby  compromising  the quality of both templates.  
The purpose  of this work was threefold:  (A) to introduce  an iterative  
method  for multimodal  T 1 w and DTI template  construction  that aims at 
maximizing  the quality of each template  as well as the spatial matching  
between  templates  by alternating  optimization  between  modalities  and 
applying  all transformations  to both modalities,  (B) to use this method  
to develop  T 1 w and DTI templates  of the older adult brain in a com- 
mon space as part of an ongoing  project to develop  a comprehensive  
older adult brain atlas named Multichannel  Illinois Institute  of Technol-  
ogy & Rush university  Aging (MIITRA)  atlas, and (C) to evaluate  the 
performance  of the method  across iterations  and compare  it to the per- 
formance  of state-of-the-art  approaches  based on multichannel  registra-  
tion. The proposed  method  for multimodal  T 1 w and DTI template  con- 
struction  uses state-of-the-art  single modality  registration  in data from 
multiple  individuals  to maximize  the quality of one template  and applies 
the resulting  transformations  to data from both modalities,  then uses sin- 
gle modality  registration  to maximize  the quality of the other template  
and applies the resulting  transformations  to data from both modalities,  
and repeats  these steps iteratively,  combining  the transformations  from 
each step to minimize  interpolations.  Each iteration  aims at maximizing  
the quality of each of the two templates  in series, and multiple  itera- 
tions aim at enhancing  the spatial matching  between  the two templates.  
The proposed  method  was used to develop  T 1 w and DTI templates  of 
the older adult brain in a common  space. The performance  of the pro- 
posed method  was evaluated  across iterations  and was also compared  to 
that of approaches  using multichannel  registration  in terms of template  
quality,  spatial matching  across templates,  and spatial normalization  of 
older adult data. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  and data acquisition  
Two older adult brain MRI datasets  were used in this work. Dataset  
1 was used for constructing  multimodal  T 1 w and DTI templates.  
Dataset  1 consisted  of structural  T 1 w and diﬀusion  data from 202 non- 
demented  older adults (50% male; 65.2–94.9  years age range; mean ± sd 
age = 80.56 ± 8.14 years of age; 161 with no cognitive  impairment  and 
41 with mild cognitive  impairment)  participating  in the Rush Memory  
and Aging Project (MAP) ( Bennett  et al., 2018 ). All participants  pro- 
vided written  informed  consent  according  to procedures  approved  by 
the institutional  committee  for the protection  of human subjects.  Pre- 
vious work has shown that this number  of participants  is suﬃciently  
large to generate  an unbiased  and robust brain template  ( Ridwan  et al., 
2021 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). All data were collected  on a 3T Siemens  
(158 persons)  and a 3T Philips MRI scanner  (44 persons).  T 1 w im- 
ages were acquired  using a 3D magnetization  prepared  rapid acquisi-  
tion gradient  echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  with the following  parameters:  
for 3T Siemens,  TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, 
ﬁeld of view = 256 mm x 256 mm, 176 sagittal  slices, acquired  voxel 
size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 2; for 3T Philips,  
TR = 8 ms, TE =",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5593, 5596), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8888, 8891), match=' 3.'>"

regions  that showed  further activation  during self-appraisal  compared  
to rest). These regions  were located  within the mid-MPFC,  ventral PCC, 
and left IPL. Dynamic  causal modelling  (DCM) was then used to ex- 
amine the directional  interactions  between  these regions.  Our results 
demonstrated  that self-related  processes  were driven via PCC activity,  
which upregulated  activity  of the MPFC and IPL. The PCC, in turn, was 
downregulated  by the MPFC. Overall,  the ﬁndings  suggested  that while 
self-representations  broadly  access the DMN through  the PCC, their cog- 
nitive elaboration  appears  to be regulated  by the MPFC ( Davey et al., 
2016 ; 2017 ). 
The aim of the current  study was to extend our previous  ﬁnd- 
ings by investigating  the dynamics  of the core-self  network  under dual 
self-appraisal  conditions.  We examined  both direct self-appraisal  (as in 
Davey et al., 2016 ), as well as reﬂected  self-appraisal  –a higher or- 
der construct  of self-appraisal.  Whereas  direct self-appraisal  involves  re- 
ﬂecting  upon oneself in relation  to personality  attributes,  reﬂected  self- 
appraisal  comprises  considering  the way one is perceived  by others (e.g., 
what do others think of me?). These two constructs  are closely related,  
as reﬂected  self-appraisal  fundamentally  emerges  as a function  of one’s 
own self perceptions  ( Shrauger  and Schoeneman,  1979 ; Kenny and De- 
Paulo, 1993 ; Christensen  et al., 2003 ). However,  reﬂected  self-appraisal  
can also serve as a mediator  between  actual appraisals  by signiﬁcant  
others and direct self-appraisal  ( Bois et al., 2005 ). Given the overlap  be- 
tween both forms of self-appraisal,  it is not surprising  that past fMRI 
studies have shown that they evoke common  activation  of DMN re- 
gions, including  the PCC and MPFC ( Ochsner  et al., 2005 ). Reﬂected  
self-appraisal  also shows greater propensity  to engage the MPFC and 
left IPL with the adjacent  temporoparietal  junction  ( D’Argembeau  et al., 
2007 ), and it has been suggested  that these regions  are related to distin- 
guishing  between  perspectives  and inferring  the mental states of others. 
Reﬂected  self-appraisal  has, however,  been far less studied  in relation  
to DMN function  and no current  studies to date have examined  how it 
is instantiated  at the level of DMN core-self  network  dynamics.  
To extend Davey et al. (2016 ; 2017 ), we designed  our current  exper- 
iment to map the activity  of core-self  regions  across these self-appraisal  
conditions,  and to model and compare  their functional  interactions  us- 
ing DCM. Whereas  in this past work, our modelling  emphasized  the im- 
portance  of MPFC and PCC interaction  during direct self-appraisal,  we 
expanded  our approach  here to give equal emphasis  to the IPL. Our 
primary  hypothesis  was that the engagement  of the core-self  network  
would generalize  strongly  across both self-appraisal  conditions,  replicat-  
ing the model described  in previous  studies ( Davey et al., 2016 , 2017 ). 
Informed  by past ﬁndings  ( D’Argembeau  et al., 2007 ), we also expected  
to characterize  a stronger  inﬂuence  of the IPL on network  dynamics,  
including  a potentially  distinct  role for this region in shaping  network  
dynamics  during reﬂected  compared  to direct self-appraisal.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
A total of 122 healthy  young participants  completed  the full study 
protocol  after meeting  the following  eligibility  criteria:  they (i) were 
aged between  16 and 25 years; (ii) were competent  English  speakers;  
(iii) had no current  or past diagnosis  of mental illness (assessed  with 
the SCID-5 non-patient  interview;  First et al., 2015 ); (iv) were not tak- 
ing any psychoactive  medications;  and (v) had no contraindications  to 
MRI. All participants  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision. Written  
informed  consent  was obtained  from each participant  following  a com- 
plete description  of the study protocol.  Eleven participants  were subse- 
quently  excluded:  3 because  of excessive  head motion during scanning  
(see further),  and 8 because  of suboptimal  task performance  (deﬁned  as 
less than 80% accuracy  on the control task condition).  The ﬁnal sam- 
ple included  111 participants  (74 female,  mean age 21.4 years, SD = 2.3 
years). The study protocol  was approved  by The University  of Melbourne  Human  Research  Ethics Committee  and was carried out in accordance  
with the Declaration  of Helsinki.  
2.2. Task design 
Participants  completed  an fMRI task composed  of 4 experimental  
conditions:  direct self-appraisal,  reﬂected  self-appraisal,  external  atten- 
tion, and rest-ﬁxation  –t h e same task design as Davey et al. (2016 ; 
2017 ) with the addition  of the reﬂected  self-appraisal  condition.  In 
3 of the conditions,  participants  were presented  with words drawn 
from a list of frequently  used trait adjectives  ( Anderson,  1968 ). Words 
were presented  in blocks (6 blocks per condition,  5 words per block). 
In the direct self-appraisal  condition,  they were asked to respond  to 
the question  “Would  you use this word to describe  you? ”. In the re- 
ﬂected self-appraisal  condition,  they were asked “Would  others use this 
word to describe  you? ”, and in the external  attention  condition  they 
responded  to the question  “Does this word have four or more vow- 
els? ”. As noted in Davey et al. (2016) , the external  attention  condi- 
tion was designed  to require  a high level of attention;  the intent be- 
ing to minimize  the likelihood  of task-independent  thoughts  during its 
performance,  which are known to correlate  with increased  DMN activ- 
ity. To each stimulus,  participants  responded  “Yes ”or “No ”by pressing  
on one of two allocated  buttons  on a curved 4-button  ﬁbre-optic  re- 
sponse pad (Cambridge  Research  Systems  Ltd.). The 3 lists of 30 words 
that formed  these conditions  were matched  on valence  and number  of 
vowels and were counterbalanced  across participants  (see Inline Sup- 
plementary  Table 1). Each 27 second block (2 s of instruction  followed  
by 5 words presented  for 5 s each) was interspersed  with a 10 second 
rest-ﬁxation  block in which participants  were asked to ﬁxate on a cen- 
trally presented  crosshair.  The task was presented  using Paradigm  soft- 
ware ( http://paradigmexperiments.com  ) on a Dell computer  via MRI- 
compatible  high-resolution  goggles  (VisuaStim  Digital System,  Reso- 
nance Technology  Inc., Northridge,  CA). Response  data (accuracy  and 
reaction-times)  were analysed  with IBM SPSS Statistics  (Version  26.0).

attentional  modulation  of neural activity.  Instead,  most studies on both 
non-human  animals  and human participants  rely on less direct measures  
of neural entrainment,  such as inter-trial  phase-locking.  For example,  
Lakatos  et al. (2013) and Lakatos  et al. (2016) showed  that when rhesus 
macaques  attend to one of two tone streams  presented  at diﬀerent  rates, 
phase-locking  at the attended  rate increases.  Similarly,  when human 
participants  attend to one of two temporally  interdigitated  tone streams,  
there is a roughly  180-degree  shift in the phase of the neural response  
at the tone stream presentation  rate ( Laﬀere et al., 2020a, b ). Studies  of 
selective  attention  to speech have also shown that low-frequency  neu- 
ral activity  more closely mirrors  the slow amplitude  modulation  pat- 
terns of the attended  stimulus  stream,  compared  to the ignored  stream 
( Kerlin et al., 2010 ; Ding and Simon, 2013 ; Zion Golumbic  et al., 2013 ; 
O’Sullivan  et al., 2015 ; Ghinst et al., 2016 ). This phenomenon  is some- 
times interpreted  according  to the endogenous  oscillation  framework,  
i.e. as reﬂecting  entrainment  of cortical  oscillations  to the temporal  
structure  of attended  speech ( Horton et al., 2013 ; Riecke et al., 2018 ; 
Fuglsang  et al., 2020 ; for a discussion,  see Obleser  and Kayser,  2019 ). 
Such research  has shown that attention  modulates  the strength  of the 
relationship  between  neural activity  and the temporal  structure  of the 
attended  signal. However,  this entrainment  in a broad sense —the pres- 
ence of stimulus-brain  temporal  alignment  —is not strong evidence  for 
entrainment  in a narrow  sense —phase-locking  of ongoing  oscillations.  
As deﬁned  by Obleser  and Kayser 2019 , a more stringent  test of entrain-  
ment in a narrow  sense is to show that the phase of endogenous,  ongoing  
oscillators  is adjusted,  such that peaks align with timepoints  containing  
acoustic  edges in attended  stimuli.  With the exception  of Lakatos  et al., 
2008 and Besle et al., 2011 , both of whom showed  evidence  for the ex- 
istence of slow neural rhythms  aligned  with the temporal  structure  of 
attended  stimulus  streams,  the remainder  of these ﬁndings  are consis- 
tent with an alternate  explanation  –that attention  acts as a ﬁlter atten- 
uating and amplifying  exogenous  responses  to sound. Attention-driven  
increases  in phase-locking  or shifts in neural phase at the rate of stimu- 
lus presentation  could potentially  be generated  by enhancement  of the 
magnitude  of ERPs to the onsets of sounds in attended  streams,  with re- 
sponses  to sounds in unattended  streams  either unaltered  or attenuated.  
Indeed,  a large body of research  has shown that selective  attention  to 
a sound stream can increase  the amplitude  of exogenously-evoked  po- 
tentials  to sound onsets within the target stream ( Hillyard  et al., 1973 ; 
Chait et al., 2010 ; Choi et al., 2013 ; Dai et al., 2018 ), including  the 
P50 and N100 components  ( Woldorﬀet  al., 1993 ). These enhanced  re- 
sponses  would then lead to the increased  phase-locking  commonly  re- 
ported as a neural correlate  of auditory  selective  attention.  
In sum, much of the existing  research  on auditory  selective  attention  
is consistent  with two competing  explanations:  one positing  selective  
attention  as a ﬁlter that ampliﬁes  or attenuates  exogenous  responses  to 
stimuli,  and the other suggesting  that endogenous  oscillators  synchro-  
nize to the temporal  structure  of attended  stimuli.  In the study reported  
below, we designed  an EEG experiment  to potentially  adjudicate  be- 
tween these two explanations.  Two groups of participants  were asked 
to attend to one of two streams  composed  of temporally  interleaved  
tone sequences.  Across conditions,  we manipulated  tone presentation  
rate; across groups,  we varied tone duration.  By examining  the shape 
of the attentional  modulation  of the ERP waveform,  we can test predic- 
tions linked to the neural entrainment  versus attentional  ﬁlter accounts.  
First, if the ’attention  as neural ﬁlter’ account  holds, and attention  mod- 
ulates the gain of event-related  responses  to sound onset, then the width 
of the attentional  modulation  should be limited to the time window  of 
the N100 –or, if it extends  to time points containing  adjacent  positive  
components,  the modulation’s  polarity  should ﬂip (changing  from neg- 
ative to positive).  On the other hand, the neural entrainment  account  
suggests  that the attentional  modulation  should extend over a greater 
length of time, especially  at slower rates. The contrasting  predictions  
of the attentional  ﬁlter and neural entrainment  accounts  are illustrated  
in Fig. 1 , which shows how the response  waveform  in the 2 Hz condi- 
tion would be modulated  by 1) attentional  enhancement  of the N100, 
Fig. 1. Contrasting  predictions  of the attentional  ﬁlter and neural entrainment

lation waveform.  Top: Passive response  to low/high  tone pairs presented  at a

as posited  by the attentional  ﬁlter account,  and 2) alignment  of an os- 
cillation  with the attended  stream,  as posited  by the neural entrainment  
account.  
The endogenous  entrainment  account  also predicts  that attentional  
modulations  could continue  through  the silence between  tone sequences  
(""forward  entrainment"";  Saberi and Hickok,  2021 ), as some oscillatory  
systems  are self-sustaining.  By contrast,  the attentional  ﬁlter account  
predicts  that attentional  modulations  should die out rapidly  after the 
oﬀset of the ﬁnal tone of the sequence.  However,  sustained  oscillation  
in silence is not a characteristic  of all oscillatory  systems,  and so while 
ﬁnding  a lack of endogenous  entrainment  would place constraints  on the 
characteristics  of endogenous  models of temporally-selective  attention,  
it would not be strong evidence  against  a role for neural oscillations  
(Doelling  & Assaneo,  2021). 
To ensure that any increases  in the duration  of the modulated  por- 
tions of the waveform  at slower rates are not simply driven by increases  
in tone duration,  we included  a between-subjects  manipulation,  such 
that for half of the participants  the tones scaled in duration  with rate, 
2  M. Kachlicka,  A. Laﬀere, F. Dick et al. NeuroImage  252 (2022) 119024 
while for the remaining  participants,  the tones were always 40 ms in 
duration.  Endogenous  entrainment  accounts  posit that neural rhythms  
align with sudden  stimulus  changes  or acoustic  ""edges"" ( Doelling  et al., 
2014 ), and so these accounts  would predict that attentional  modulations  
should align with the onset of the tones and so be relatively  unaﬀected  
by manipulations  of tone duration.  
A second goal of this project was to examine  the relationship  between  
presentation  rate and the eﬀects of attention  on neural phase-locking  
to stimulus  temporal  structure.  The motor system has been proposed  to 
generate  temporal  predictions  that increase  neural sensitivity  to upcom-  
ing onsets in attended  sound streams  ( Morillon  and Schroeder,  2015 ). 
That the motor system is involved  in temporally-selective  attention  is 
supported  by the ﬁnding  that individuals  with more consistent  self- 
paced tapping  show more robust eﬀects of attention  on neural phase- 
locking  to attended  sound streams  ( Laﬀere et al. 2020b ). If temporally-  
selective  attention  does rely on implicit  motor planning,  then phase- 
locking  to attended  sound streams  may be more robust for slower rates, 
as the ability to align movements  with the temporal  structure  of sound 
is rate-limited  ( Repp 2003 ). To investigate  this possibility,  we compared  
degree of phase-locking  to the attended  band and the diﬀerence  in phase 
between  the attend high and attend low conditions  across rates, pre- 
dicting that the phase of neural activity  would be better aligned  with 
attended  streams  at slower rates. 
Materials  and methods  
Participants  
Participants  were postgraduate  students  enrolled  in courses  related 
to auditory  processing  (audiology,  auditory  neuroscience  and acoustics)  
or professional  musicians  or audio engineers  living in London.  Partic- 
ipants were selected  for higher levels of auditory  experience  and ex- 
pertise because  the experiment  was quite demanding  of auditory  atten- 
tion, and in previous  studies,  non-expert  participants  required  somewhat  
more training  to achieve  good performance  in the task ( Laﬀere et al., 
2020a ). 15 participants  (aged 19–48, M = 29.47, SD = 7.41; 9 females)  
took part in the ﬁrst experiment  (with variable  tone durations  across 
presentation  rates). 14 diﬀerent  participants  (aged 22–36, M = 28.36, 
SD = 4.89; 9 females)  took part in the second experiment  (with a sin- 
gle ﬁxed short tone duration  across presentation  rates). All participants  
reported  no prior diagnosis  of hearing  impairment  or neurological  dis- 
orders aﬀecting  hearing.  The experimental  paradigm  was approved  by 
the Research  Ethics Committee  of the Department  of Psychological  Sci- 
ences at Birkbeck,  University  of London.  Processed  data are available  at 
https://osf.io/mds9q/.  
Experimental  and stimulus  design and presentation  
In both experiments,  participants  listened  to series of interleaved  
tone sequences  segregated  into high and low frequency  bands (see 
Fig. 2 ). Both experiments  used a fully within-subject  design, crossing  
attention  condition  (attend-high  band sequences,  attend-low  band se- 
quences,  listen passively)  with within-band  tone presentation  rate (2 Hz, 
3 Hz, 4 Hz, 5 Hz). (Our use of 2 Hz as the slowest  condition  was moti- 
vated by time considerations;  the experiment  lasted approximately  two 
hours, and slower rates (such as 1 Hz) would have required  an infeasi-  
ble amount  of extra time, relative  to the other conditions.)  Each of the 
12 combinations  of attention  condition  by tone presentation  rate was 
completed  by each participant,  with condition  order randomized  across 
participants.  
The basic stimulus  units were cosine-ramped  pure tones constructed  
at a 48 kHz sampling  rate using MATLAB  (The MathWorks,  Inc., Nat- 
ick, MA). These tones were arranged  into sequences  of six, followed  by a

We thus tested whether  breathing  is associated  with the voluntary  
initiation  of two types of mental imagery,  namely  motor imagery  (MI) 
and visual imagery  (VI). MI involves  the mental simulation  of actual mo- 
tor execution,  based on the generation  of a complete  motor preparation  
program  without  any overt motor output ( Jeannerod  and Decety,  1995 ). 
Previous  work has demonstrated  that such MI performance  is associated  
with cortical  activation  within the premotor  (e.g., supplementary  mo- 
tor area; SMA) and motor cortices  (e.g., precentral  gyrus) ( Hétu et al., 
2013 ), as well as changes  in autonomic  nervous  activity  (e.g., heart rate, 
respiratory  rate) comparable  to those seen during actual motor execu- 
tion ( Decety et al., 1993 ). VI refers to the internal  generation  of the 
visual experience  of a particular  scene without  the presence  of the cor- 
responding  sensory  input from the environment  ( Dijkstra  et al., 2019 ; 
Kosslyn  et al., 2001 ; Pearson  et al., 2015 ). VI has been conjectured  to 
be a weak form of visual perception,  with which it shares many of the 
same neural mechanisms  ( Dijkstra  et al., 2019 ; Pearson  et al., 2015 ). To 
test our hypothesis,  participants  performed  a modiﬁed  Libet paradigm  
( Libet et al., 1983 ), a classical  behavioral  paradigm  for measuring  the 
onset of self-initiated  actions,  with three diﬀerent  types of motor and 
mental tasks: motor execution  (ME), MI, and VI. 
Regarding  the underlying  mechanisms  of breathing-action  coupling,  
a recent study proposed  that interactions  between  the breathing  system 
and voluntary  actions occur to minimize  potential  competition  between  
motor commands  originating  during the production  of voluntary  hand 
motion and those arising from the involuntary  breathing  motor system 
( Park et al., 2020 ). Voluntary  action has been suggested  to be composed  
of three stages: (1) formation  of intention  (2) preparation  of action, and 
(3) action execution  ( Haggard,  2008 ). In our experimental  design, the 
three experimental  conditions  (i.e., ME, MI, VI) would share compara-  
ble ﬁrst two stages of voluntary  action (i.e., intention  and preparation  
of action),  whereas  the required  type of action execution  is diﬀerent.  
Thus, our current  study was designed  to investigate  at which stage (i.e., 
intention-preparation  or execution)  such breathing-action  coupling  oc- 
curs. On the one hand, if such competition  requires  overt movement  
and occurs during the action execution  stage, breathing-action  coupling  
would be observed  only during ME, but not in either of the mental im- 
agery tasks. On the other hand, if breathing-action  coupling  occurs at 
the intention-preparation  stage, such an interaction  would also be ob- 
served in the mental imagery  conditions  (i.e., MI, VI). We further sepa- 
rated the MI and VI conditions  to test whether  diﬀerent  types of mental 
imagery  (motor vs. visual) have a diﬀerential  inﬂuence  on breathing-  
action coupling.  For instance,  if breathing-action  coupling  requires  the 
involvement  of motor cortical  activity,  it would be observed  in MI but 
not VI, as MI still activates  the motor cortex ( Hétu et al., 2013 ). On the 
other hand, if breathing-action  coupling  occurs in the cortical  areas as- 
sociated  with more general  action planning,  such as SMA ( Nachev  et al., 
2008 ), it would be observed  in both MI and VI conditions.  In addi- 
tion, our experimental  design with a simultaneous  recording  of EEG 
signals during these tasks provides  the opportunity  to test whether  the 
generation  of the RP requires  overt movement  or whether  the RP is 
associated  with intention  and preparation  of action, a question  that 
has largely been overlooked  in the literature  ( Alexander  et al., 2016 ). 
We here report that (1) the respiratory  phase was coupled  with the 
voluntary  initiation  of mental imagery  performance,  (2) the RP wave- 
forms were observed  while the participants  were performing  mental im- 
agery tasks, and (3) the RP amplitude  was coupled  with the respiratory  
phase. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Thirty-ﬁve  participants  (17 female;  1 left-handed;  mean age: 
25.9 ± 4.1 years) took part in the study and reported  no history of car- 
diovascular  disease  or neurological  or psychiatric  disorders.  All partic- 
ipants signed a written  informed  consent  form and were paid for their participation.  All procedures  were approved  by the local ethics commit-  
tee (Commission  Cantonale  d’Ethique  de Genève).  One participant  was 
excluded  from analysis  due to excessive  movement-related  artifacts  in 
the EEG data, which contaminated  > 50% of trials. Also, one participant  
was excluded  because  of the impaired  trigger signals due to a technical  
problem  during the recording.  The data from thirty-three  subjects  were 
analyzed.  
2.2. Paradigm  
During the motor execution  (ME) task, participants  performed  the 
classical  Libet task ( Libet et al., 1983 ), as described  below. Throughout  
the task, participants  put their right index ﬁnger on the keypad  and 
were instructed  to press the button at any time they wanted  to. A trial 
started when a red dot appeared  at a random  location  of the clock face 
(radius:  2°of visual angle) and participants  were instructed  to ﬁxate a 
dot at the center of the clock face. The red dot always rotated  only one 
full cycle for 10.24 s. Participants  were instructed  to wait for at least a 
quarter  rotation  (i.e., 2.56 s), and press the button before the end of one 
full rotation.  Following  previous  studies,  we asked the participants  to 
refrain from (1) pre-planning  the interval  between  the start of the trial 
and the button press, and (2) using regular  intervals  between  the start of 
the trial and the button press ( Libet et al., 1983 ; Schurger  et al., 2012 ). 
The red dot then further rotated  another  quarter  cycle and disappeared.  
After 0.5 s, the dot reappeared  at a random  location,  and participants  
were instructed  to report the timing of the button press by moving  the 
location  of the clock hand using the keypad.  
During the motor imagery  (MI) task, participants  were instructed  to 
imagine  pressing  the key whenever  they wanted  to, but without  actually  
moving  their ﬁngers.  Except for the instruction  regarding  their perfor- 
mance,  every procedure  was identical  to the ME condition.  At the end 
of each trial, participants  reported  the estimated  timing of when they 
performed  the MI task. During the visual imagery  task (VI), we wanted  
the participant  to perform  a mental action that does not involve  any mo- 
tor component  (i.e., neither  motor execution  nor motor imagery)  while 
maintaining  the level of visual input and attention  similar to the other 
two tasks (i.e., ME, MI). Thus, we developed  a simple non-motoric  VI 
task, still utilizing  the rotating  clock hand. Participants  were instructed  
to imagine  stopping  the clock hand rotation  whenever  they wanted  to. 
Then at the end of each trial, the participants  retrospectively  reported  
the estimated  timing of when they conducted  the VI task. Participants  
conducted  three blocks (i.e., a total of 75 trials) of each task. Of note, 
participants  always performed  the VI task before the other two tasks. 
This was to prevent  participants  from thinking  about motor processes  
(e.g., motor inhibition)  during the VI task. For instance,  a previous  study 
showed  inhibition  of a motor response  could generate  RP-like  wave- 
forms ( Misirlisoy  and Haggard,  2014 ), which could confound  our ex- 
perimental  design. In other words, when participants  were performing  
the VI task, they did not know that there are other conditions  poten- 
tially using motor imagery  or execution.  Participants  then conducted  
the remaining  six blocks of ME and MI, in a randomized  order.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118822,"2. Methods  
2.1. Distributed  ComBat  
ComBat  ( Fortin et al., 2018; 2017; Johnson  et al., 2007 ) seeks to 
remove  scanner  eﬀects in the mean and variance  of neuroimaging  data 
in an empirical  Bayes framework.  To handle the distributed  data set- 
ting, we propose  d-ComBat  as an algorithm  that yields adjusted  data 
identical  to the original  ComBat  method.  Let 𝒚 ij = ( 𝑦 ij 1 , 𝑦 ij 2 , …, 𝑦 ijV ) 𝑇 , 
𝑖 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝐾, 𝑗 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑛 𝑖 denote the 𝑉 -dimensional  vectors  of ob- 
served data where 𝑖 indexes  scanner,  𝑗indexes  subjects  within scanners,  
𝑛 𝑖 is the number  of subjects  acquired  on scanner  𝑖 , and 𝑉 is the number  
of features.  For simplicity,  we assume  each site uses a diﬀerent  scanner  
and the data are collected  from 𝐾sites. However,  our algorithm  could 
be easily extended  to allow varying  number  of scanners  per site. Our 
goal is to harmonize  the data from these 𝑁 = ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑛 𝑖 subjects  across 
the 𝐾scanners  without  pooling  data at a single processing  site. ComBat  
assumes  that the 𝑉 features  𝑣 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑉 follow 
𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑣 = 𝛼𝑣 + 𝒙 𝑇 
𝑖𝑗 𝜷𝑣 + 𝛾𝑖𝑣 + 𝛿𝑖𝑣 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣, (1) 
where 𝛼𝑣 is the intercept,  𝒙 𝑖𝑗 is the vector of covariates,  𝜷𝑣 is the vector of 
regression  coeﬃcients,  𝛾𝑖𝑣 is the mean scanner  eﬀect, and 𝛿𝑖𝑣 is the vari- 
ance scanner  eﬀect. The errors 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣 are assumed  to follow 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣 ∼𝑁(0 , 𝜎2 
𝑣 ) . 
The original  ComBat  contains  two steps. The ﬁrst is to standardize  
the original  features  by removing  the covariate  eﬀects and scaling each 
residuals  by its total variance.  The second step involves  estimating  the 
scanner  eﬀects 𝛾and 𝛿using an empirical  Bayes framework  and remov- 
ing them from the original  data. We propose  a distributed  algorithm  for 
each of the two steps in the next two sections.  
Standardization  
The original  implementation  of ComBat  ﬁrst standardizes  the mean 
and variance  of data across scanners  via feature-wise  least-squares  esti- 
mation.  The standardized  data are calculated  as 
𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑣 = 𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − ̂𝛼𝑣 − 𝑋 𝑖𝑗 ̂𝛽𝑣 
̂𝜎𝑣 
However,  in the distributed  setting we do not have direct access to the 
entire dataset and cannot directly  compute  estimates  for the intercepts  
𝛼𝑣 , regression  coeﬃcients  𝜷𝑣 , scanner-speciﬁc  mean shifts 𝛾𝑖𝑣 or popu- 
lation standard  deviations  𝜎𝑣 for each feature.  To address  this problem,  
we propose  an estimation  procedure  that only requires  computation  and 
transmission  of deidentiﬁed  summary  statistics  between  distributed  sites 
and a central location.  As in the original  ComBat  methodology,  estima-  
tion is performed  under the constraint  ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑛 𝑖 ̂𝛾𝑖𝑣 = 0 to ensure identiﬁ-  
ability. 
For each feature,  deﬁne 𝜽𝑣 = ( 𝛼𝑣 , 𝜷𝑇 
𝑣 , 𝛾1 𝑣 , 𝛾2 𝑣 , …, 𝛾𝐾−1 ,𝑣 ) 𝑇 . 
Then we can rewrite  the data across all 𝑁subjects  𝒚 𝑣 = 
( 𝑦 11 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 1 𝑛 1 𝑣 , 𝑦 21 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 2 𝑛 2 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 𝐾𝑛 𝑀 𝑣 ) 𝑇 as 𝒚 𝑣 = 𝑊 𝜽+ 𝑒 𝑣 where 
𝑊 = ⎡ 
⎢ 
⎢ ⎣ 𝑊 1 
⋮ 
𝑊 𝐾 ⎤

⎥ ⎦ = ⎡

1 𝑛 𝐾 𝑋 𝐾 − 𝑛 1 ∕ 𝑛 𝐾 1 𝑛 𝐾 ⋯ − 𝑛 𝐾−2 ∕ 𝑛 𝐾 1 𝑛 𝐾 − 𝑛 𝐾−1 ∕ 𝑛 𝐾 1 𝑛 𝐾 ⎤ 
⎥ 
⎥ 
⎥ 
⎥ ⎦ 
The ordinary  least squares  estimate  can be obtained  via ̂𝜽𝑣 = 
( 𝑊 𝑇 𝑊 ) −1 ( 𝑊 𝑇 𝒚 𝑣 ) = ( ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑊 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑊 𝑖 ) −1 ( ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑊 𝑖 𝒚 𝑣 ) . By decomposing  the 
estimation  into site-speciﬁc  summary  statistics  𝑊 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑊 𝑖 and 𝑊 𝑖 𝒚 𝑣 , ̂𝜽𝑣 can 
be obtained  by computing  these summary  statistics  and sending  them to 
a central location.  Construction  of 𝑊 𝑖 and calculation  of these summary  
statistics  are simple for 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝐾 − 1 since they are just the usual design matrices  𝑋 𝑖 concatenated  with an intercept  column  and scanner-  
speciﬁc  columns  of ones. To standardize  the variance  of the data, the 
marginal  variance  is estimated  as ̂𝜎2 
𝑣 = 1 
𝑁 ∑
ij ( 𝑦 ijv − ̂𝛼𝑣 − 𝑋 ij ̂𝛽𝑣 − ̂𝛾2 
iv ) , 𝑣 = 
1 , 2 , …, 𝑉 , which is decomposable  by site. 
Empirical  Bayes adjustment  
The key step in ComBat  involves  use of empirical  Bayes estimates  of 
site-speciﬁc  location  and scale parameters  to remove  site eﬀects while 
pooling  information  across features.  ComBat  assumes  that the prior dis- 
tributions  𝛾𝑖𝑣 ∼𝑁( 𝛾𝑖 , 𝜏2 
𝑖 ) and 𝛿2 
𝑖𝑣 ∼Inverse  Gamma  ( 𝜆𝑖 , 𝜈𝑖 ) where hyper- 
parameter  estimates  ̄𝛾𝑖 , ̄𝜏𝑖 , ̄𝜆𝑖 , and ̄𝜈𝑖 are obtained  via method  of mo- 
ments. ComBat  then ﬁnds the conditional  posterior  means 𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 and 𝛿∗ 
𝑖𝑣 , 
computed  iteratively  through  
𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 = 𝑛 𝑖 ̄𝜏2 
𝑖 ̂𝛾𝑖𝑣 + 𝛿2 
𝑖𝑣 ̄𝛾𝑖𝑣 
𝑛 𝑖 ̄𝜏2 
𝑖 + 𝛿2∗ 
𝑖𝑣 
𝛿2∗ 
𝑖𝑣 = ̄𝜈𝑖 + 1 
2 ∑
𝑗 ( 𝑍 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − 𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ) 2 
𝑛 𝑖 
2 + ̄𝜆𝑖 − 1 
Each site’s mean and variance  parameter  estimates  are computed  
from data within that site and so this step is distributed  by its nature. 
The ComBat-adjusted  data is then obtained  within each site via 
𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝐵𝑎𝑡 
𝑖𝑗𝑣 = ̂𝜎𝑣 
𝛿∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − ̂𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ) + ̂𝛼𝑣 + 𝑋 𝑖𝑗 ̂𝛽𝑣 
Algorithm  
In the distributed  setting,  ComBat  only requires  two back-and-forth  
communications  between  sites and a central location  for estimation  of 
the standardization  parameters.  We propose  the d-ComBat  algorithm  
and illustrate  our method  in Fig. 1 . 
1. Initiation  - broadcast  from central site: The central analysis  site 
chooses  identiﬁcation  numbers  for each scanner  and communicates  
these to each location.  
2. Local computation  at collaborative  sites for mean parameters.  
(a) Each site locally computes  scanner-speciﬁc  summary  statistics  
𝑊 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑊 𝑖 and 𝑊 𝑖 𝒚 𝑣 to the central site ( Fig. 1 a). 
(b) These summary  statistics  are then sent back to the central site.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(6331, 6335), match='\n2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(5597, 5601), match=' \n3.'>"

tory network  changes  measured  with magnetoencephalography  (MEG) 
( Englot et al., 2015; Ranasinghe  et al., 2017 ) or electroencephalog-  
raphy (EEG) imaging  ( Brookes  et al., 2011; Dominguez  et al., 2013; 
Hohlefeld  et al., 2013 ). Approaches  for RSFC analyses  include  seed- 
based correlations  ( Lv et al., 2018 ), independent  component  analysis  
( Beckmann  et al., 2005 ) and dynamic  mode decomposition  ( Brunton  
et al., 2016; Kutz et al., 2016 ). Recent work has also focused  on re- 
covering  the static RSFC from the underlying  structural  connectivity  
via graph methods  like the network  diﬀusion  model ( Abdelnour  et al., 
2014 ) and algebraic  spectral  graph expansions  ( Abdelnour  et al., 2018; 
Becker et al., 2018; Meier et al., 2016; Tewarie  et al., 2020 ). of dynamic  
changes  in functional  network  architecture.  To date, most existing  sta- 
tistical techniques  for RSFC have assumed  that the functional  connec-  
tivity structure  is stationary  over a dataset,  which is in direct contrast  to 
emerging  data that suggest  the strength  of connectivity  between  regions  
is variable  over time. Therefore,  the development  of statistical  methods  
that enable exploration  of dynamic  changes  in the functional  connectiv-  
ity is currently  of great importance  to the neuroscience  community.  
The extension  of current  techniques  to capture  the dynamic  changes  
in RSFC during the scan period is a lively yet evolving  topic. It is well 
known that the brain at rest is in fact quite dynamic,  with RSFC capable  
of changing  over a matter of seconds  to minutes  ( Hutchison  et al., 2013 ). 
This time varying  pattern,  namely  the dynamic  functional  connectivity,  
has been shown to constitute  novel imaging  biomarkers  for identify-  
ing neurological  dysfunctions  such as schizophrenia,  autism and vari- 
ous forms of dementia  ( Damaraju  et al., 2014; Filippi et al., 2019; Long 
et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2014; Mash et al., 2019; Pasquini  et al., 2020; 
Rashid et al., 2016; 2014; Schumacher  et al., 2019 ). For instance,  dy- 
namic FC may underlie  the neuropathology  of major depressive  disorder  
( Long et al., 2020 ), can assess the abnormal  brain states for schizophre-  
nia ( Duan et al., 2020 ) and it can identify  early mild cognitive  impair-  
ment for dementia  ( Wee et al., 2016 ) and distinguish  Alzheimer’s  Dis- 
ease (AD) patients  from healthy  controls  ( Schumacher  et al., 2019 ). 
Thus, the dynamic  component  of RSFC may serve as an additional  
biomarker  of neurological  disorders  - a key motivation  of current  work. 
Currently,  the most common  approach  to extract dynamic  RSFCs 
relies on the sliding-window  method,  which generally  consists  of two 
steps: (1) divide signals into segments  of the equal duration;  (2) imple- 
ment the traditional  seed based method  ( Biswal et al., 1995; Fox et al., 
2005 ), independent  component  analysis  ( Allen et al., 2014; Calhoun  
et al., 2001; van de Ven et al., 2004 ), or the dynamic  mode decompo-  
sition method  ( Brunton  et al., 2016; Kutz et al., 2016 ) on the segments  
sequentially.  While the sliding-window  method  is practically  attractive  
since it enables  the use of earlier static methods  in the dynamic  context,  
it presents  several limitations  and trade-oﬀs,  which will be discussed  in 
detail in Section  4.1 . One notable  issue is that current  methods  for dy- 
namic functional  connectivity  (FC) analysis  do not account  for biological  
constraints  or biophysically  realistic  models of brain activity  and state 
switches.  This represents  a lost opportunity  to overcome  some of the lim- 
itations  noted in Section  4.1 . Here we propose  a novel model for extract-  
ing dynamic  FC that relies on discrete  and discontinuous  “state changes  ”
in brain activity.  Indeed,  there is mounting  evidence  that the brain’s dy- 
namics results from its cycling  through  a number  of brain-states,  i.e., the 
transient,  patterned,  quasi-stable  states or patterns  of the brain activity  
( Coquelet  et al., 2021; Croce et al., 2020; Michel and Koenig,  2018 ), 
separated  by brain state switches,  such that while the FC during brain 
states may be considered  stationary,  FC during the transitions  between  
brain states are subject to discontinuous,  abrupt or non-smooth  events 
( Li et al., 2013; Saper et al., 2010; Vidaurre  et al., 2017 ). In addition  
to being more biologically  realistic,  this approach  allows us to beneﬁt 
from several constraints,  especially  the concept  that the spatial features  
of brain activity  might be stationary,  while the coupling  between  these 
stationary  structures  might be temporally  dynamic.  For instance,  the 
spatial structures  may arise from the underlying  structural  connectivity,  
while the temporal  parameters  describe  the dynamic  switching  between  brain networks  over time. Therefore,  while the spatial structure  of the 
FC patterns  is considered  stationary  due to the linkage  with the struc- 
ture of the brain, how these spatial features  work together  is allowed  
to vary over time. It is further possible  to constrain  the dynamics  of the 
temporal  parameters.  Rather than randomly  or continuously  traversing  
through  the latent state-space,  RSFCs most likely undergo  discrete  and 
discontinuous  shifts, resulting  in the concept  of “brain states ”( Li et al., 
2013; Saper et al., 2010; Vidaurre  et al., 2017 ). Hence we recommend  to 
impose piece-wise  constancy  to these temporally  changing  coeﬃcients.  
We show that using these powerful  constraints,  it is possible  to over- 
come the trade-oﬀs  and limitations  currently  pertinent  to the dynamic  
RSFC analysis.  
We present  a uniﬁed solution  for extracting  dynamic  FCs from both 
fMRI and MEG data, which directly  addresses  these limitations.  We call 
this method  the time-varying  dynamic  network  (TVDN)  framework.  We 
develop  a novel automatic  and provably  statistically  optimal  inference  
algorithm  based on the TVDN model to infer the dynamics  that under- 
lie the model. We extract the stationary  spatial features  and detect the 
dynamic  brain state switches  adaptively.  The algorithm  is able to divide 
the brain signals into uneven  segments,  each of which contains  brain 
activities  in a stationary  brain state. Once the parameters  have been suc- 
cessfully  inferred,  the entire spatio-temporal  noise-free  imaging  signal 
can be reconstructed  through  a high dimensional  linear forward  model 
- a feature that is rarely available  in current  methods.  The algorithm  
involves  a few tuning or hyper-parameters,  which are automatically  se- 
lected to minimize  the uncertainties  of the number  of switches  across 
independent  samples.  We expect that the presented  TVDN framework  
will prove eﬀective  in robustly  generating  dynamic  FC features  that will 
serve as useful biomarkers  of neurological  and neurodegenerative  dis- 
eases. 
2. Materials  and methods  
The dynamic  FC contains  spatial and temporal  components  
( Lang et al., 2012 ). The spatial features  of the dynamic  FC capture  the 
links among brain regions  ( Alexander-Bloch  et al., 2010; Brier et al., 
2014; Geerligs  et al., 2015; Sanz-Arigita  et al., 2010; Van Den Heuvel 
et al., 2009 ). The temporal  features  characterize  the state changes  of 
brain activity  ( Di et al., 2013; Gonzalez-Castillo  et al., 2015; Kitzbich-  
ler et al., 2011; Moussa  et al., 2011; Shirer et al., 2012 ). Furthermore,  
the spatial features  are constrained  by the stable brain structures,  and 
hence they must be consistent  over the signal sampling  time and across 
the image modalities.  Moreover,  diﬀerent  modalities  have distinct  tem- 
poral resolutions,  and therefore  the temporal  features  are distinct  across 
the modalities.  Considering  these characteristics  of the spatial and tem- 
poral features,  we develop  a novel methodology  to extract the time 
invariant  spatial features  and time varying  temporal  features.  Fig. 1 
shows a ﬂowchart  of the estimation  procedure.  The purple oval rep- 
resents TVDN inputs, and red ovals represent  TVDN outputs.  The blue 
rectangles  represent  the building  blocks of TVDN, which we discuss in 
detail in Section  2.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5389, 5392), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8747, 8749), match='3.'>"

the absence  of a ground  truth, the hurdles  to use FC metrics  in the clinic 
are high ( Woo and Wager, 2015 ), and considerably  higher for dFC due 
to issues of interpretation  ( Lurie et al., 2020 ) and sampling  variability  
( Laumann  et al., 2017 ), although  the latter has been rigorously  chal- 
lenged ( Miller et al., 2018 ). Moreover,  the popularity  of FC and dFC 
methods  comes with a plethora  of heterogeneous  methodologies  derived  
from distinct  conceptualizations  of brain functioning  ( Bijsterbosch  et al., 
2020 ). 
Candidate  neuromarkers  should demonstrate  a high degree of re- 
liability  and ideally be robust and interpretable  in terms of neuro- 
science  ( Woo and Wager, 2015 ). Despite  eﬀorts to assess the test-retest  
reliability  of dFC metrics,  the results remain contested  ( Abrol et al., 
2017 ; Bijsterbosch  et al., 2017 ; Choe et al., 2017 ; Orban et al., 2020 ; 
Vaisvilaite  et al., 2021 ; Vohryzek  et al., 2020 ). Common  approaches  
to address  these concerns  of validity  include  comparison  of results with 
null models ( Battaglia  et al., 2020 ) or replication  of results in alternative  
datasets  ( Varley et al., 2020 ). Neuroscientiﬁc  interpretation  of candidate  
neuromarkers  is enhanced  with convergence  of evidence  from multiple  
sources  ( Woo and Wager, 2015 ), and together  with reliability,  is one of 
the necessary  conditions  to introduce  neuromarkers  into the clinic. 
With this in mind, in this paper we took a complexity-science  per- 
spective  to identify  a number  of diverse  dFC metrics  for investigation  
( Turkheimer  et al., 2021 ). Complexity  science  takes an inter-disciplinary  
approach  to identify  common  laws that govern complex  systems,  bring- 
ing together  tools from statistical  physics,  dynamical  systems  theory, 
information  theory, and other ﬁelds ( Holland,  2014 ; Thurner  et al., 
2018 ; Waldrop,  1993 ). Conceptualizing  the brain as a complex  sys- 
tem oﬀers novel perspectives  on spontaneous  ongoing  brain dynam-  
ics ( Turkheimer  et al., 2021 ). While the exact deﬁnition  of a complex  
system continuously  evolves  ( Ladyman  et al., 2013 ; Turkheimer  et al., 
2021 ), the brain satisﬁes  the four shared properties  that characterizes  a 
system as ‘complex’  ( Jensen,  1998 ): 
1 Multiplicity  and interdependence:  the brain is made of small sub- 
units that interact  with each other through  a vast network  of local 
and long-range  connections.  
2 Nonlinearity:  The interactions  between  neural elements  are often 
nonlinear,  giving rise to rich dynamical  phenomena.  
3 Self-organization:  The activity  of the multiple  brain sub-units  devel- 
ops into structured  patterns  spontaneously,  in the absence  of any 
form of centralized  control mechanisms.  
4 Emergence:  The macroscopic  behavior  of coordinated  brain activ- 
ity cannot be understood  purely in terms of the neuron-to-neuron  
interactions.  
This perspective  allows us to investigate  the brain with the sophis- 
ticated conceptual  machinery  of complexity  science,  complementing  
the existing  repertoire  of neuroimaging  analysis  techniques  with tools 
speciﬁcally  designed  to fully exploit the richness  of imaging  datasets.  
The existence  of distinct  methodologies  that investigate  intrinsic  
brain activity  either from a dynamical  systems  perspective,  from consid-  
erations  of the time-evolution  of the dynamical  system as a stochastic  
process,  or from an information  processing  perspective,  compels  us to 
confront  the challenging  task of piecing  together  a coherent  description  
of brain dynamics  consistent  across the underlying  theories.  
Two speciﬁc  metrics,  metastability  and integrated  information,  de- 
rived from bottom-up  and top-down  analysis  respectively,  hold spe- 
cial interest  for investigation.  Theoretically,  metastability  has been de- 
scribed  as a subtle blend of segregation  and integration  among brain 
regions  that show tendencies  to diverge  and function  independently,  
with tendencies  to converge  and function  collectively  ( Tognoli  and 
Kelso, 2014 ). Metastability  has been considered  a key attribute  for com- 
putational  models exploring  mechanisms  of brain dynamics  and an im- 
portant  indicator  of healthy  brain functioning  ( Deco et al., 2017 ). From 
an alternative  but complementary  perspective,  integrated  information  
(operationalized  as the quantity  Φ) has been proposed  as a way of quan- 
tifying the balance  between  integration  and segregation,  and possibly  consciousness  ( Tononi,  2004 ). More recent metrics  of integrated  infor- 
mation,  Φ𝑅 , extend this construct  to reﬂect the degree of synergistic  
and transfer  information  processing  across brain areas ( Mediano  et al., 
2022 ). Therefore,  we sought to investigate  if these two metrics  con- 
tributed  converging  evidence  for the processes  of integration  and segre- 
gation that are believed  to take place as part of intrinsic  brain activity.  
Our objective  was to develop  a coherent  description  of brain dynam-  
ics consistent  across underlying  theories.  Therefore,  rather than investi-  
gate metastability  and integrated  information  in isolation,  we assessed  
them in combination  with metrics  originating  in complexity-science,  as 
well as metrics  identiﬁed  theoretically  or empirically  as characterizing  
or contributing  to metastability  or integrated  information.  Whilst the 
methodologies  used in this study have already  been individually  vali- 
dated against  null models or with surrogate  data ( Battaglia  et al., 2020 ; 
Honari et al., 2021 ; Mediano  et al., 2022 ), there is a lack of studies 
where these methodologies  were used to compare  performance  in the 
same subjects  across multiple  fMRI acquisitions.  Therefore,  we set out 
to answer the following  questions:  are the chosen dFC metrics  represen-  
tative and reliable  across multiple  fMRI acquisitions?  Are these metrics  
related via their ability to capture  diﬀerent  aspects  of dFC? And ﬁnally, 
what are the implications  of these relationships?  
To address  these questions,  we used four resting-state  fMRI acquisi-  
tions recorded  on two consecutive  days from 99 healthy  unrelated  par- 
ticipants  from the Human  Connectome  Project ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ), 
and considered  an anatomical  parcellation  with and without  the cere- 
bellar regions.  
Materials  and methods  
Data 
All data used in this study was collected  for the Human  Connec-  
tome Project,  WU-Minn  Consortium  (Principal  Investigators:  David Van 
Essene and Kamil Ugurbil;  1U54MH091657)  with funding  from the six- 
teen NIH Institutes  and Centers  supporting  the NIH Blueprint  for Neuro- 
science  Research;  and by the McDonell  Center for Systems  Neuroscience  
at Washington  University.  
Ethics statement  
The Washington  University  institutional  review board approved  the 
scanning  protocol,  participant  recruitment  procedures,  and informed  
written  consent  forms, and consented  to share deidentiﬁed  data. 
Participants  
We used the data from the ‘500 subject’  release but restricted  our 
analysis  to the ‘100 Unrelated  Subjects’  (aged 20 to 35 years old, 54 
females  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 )). A list of employed  subject ID numbers  
and associated  scan times is provided  in Supplementary  Table ST1. 
fMRI data acquisition  and pre-processing  
Each participant  underwent  four scans of resting-state  fMRI (rs-fMRI)  
collected  over two experimental  sessions  (two scans in each session)  
which took place on consecutive  days. The datasets  acquired  from all 
participants  in each of the 4 scans are referred  to as ‘runs’ 1 to 4. During 
each scan 1200 frames were acquired  using a multiband  sequence  at 2 
mm isotropic  resolution  with a repetition  time (TR) of 0.72 s over the 
span of 14 min 24 s. Participants  were instructed  to maintain  ﬁxation  on 
a bright crosshair  presented  on a dark background  in a darkened  scan- 
ning room. The two scans in each session diﬀered  only in the oblique  
axial acquisition  phase encoding.  For the ﬁrst 6 subjects,  the rs-fMRI  
runs were acquired  using a Right-Left  (RL) phase-encoding  followed  by 
a Left-Right  (LR) phase-encoding  on both days. For the following  94 
subjects,  the order of the diﬀerent  phase-encoding  acquisitions  for the 
2  F. Hancock,  J. Cabral, A.I. Luppi et al. NeuroImage  259 (2022) 119433 
rs-fMRI  runs across days was counterbalanced  (RL followed  by LR on 
Day 1; LR followed  by RL on Day 2). 
Data were pre-processed  with the HCP’s minimal  pre-processing  
pipeline,  and denoising  was performed  by the ICA-FIX  procedure  
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ; Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ). 
A complete  description  of the acquisition  and pre-processing  details may 
be found at the HCP website  https://www.humanconnectome.org/  . 
Brieﬂy,  fMRI data was gradient-nonlinearity  distortion  corrected,  
rigidly realigned  to adjust for motion,  ﬁeldmap  corrected,  aligned  
to the structural  images,  and then registered  to MNI space 
with the nonlinear  warping  calculated  from the structural  im- 
ages. ICA-FIX  was then applied  on the data to identify  and re- 
move motion and other artifacts  in the timeseries.  The result- 
ing ﬁles provided  the baseline  for this study (e.g., MNINonLin-  
ear/Results/rfMRI_REST1_RL/rfMRI_REST1_RL_hp2000_clean.nii.gz  
from released  HCP data). 
One subject was excluded  from the analysis  as the image ﬁle was 
corrupted.  
Parcellations  
We parcellated  the pre-processed  fMRI data by averaging  time- 
courses  across all voxels for each region deﬁned  in the anatomical  par- 
cellation  AAL ( Tzourio-Mazoyer  et al., 2002 ) considering  all cortical  and 
subcortical  brain areas including  the cerebellum,  N = 116 or without  
the cerebellum  N = 90. We choose the AAL parcellation  as it includes  
subcortical  and cerebellar  regions  which are relevant  for application  of 
the methods  in future studies with psychiatric  cohorts  ( Anteraper  et al., 
2021 ; Cierpka  et al., 2017 ; Duan et al., 2015 ; McCutcheon  et al., 2019, 
2020 ). 
Bandpass  ﬁltering  
To isolate low-frequency  resting-state  signal ﬂuctuations,  we band- 
pass ﬁltered  the parcellated  fMRI time-series  within 0.01–0.08  Hz us- 
ing a discrete  Fourier  transform  (DST) computed  with a fast Fourier  
transform  (FFT) algorithm  in MATLAB.  We included  frequencies  below 
0.03 Hz, as unpublished  data indicate  that results obtained  in the lower 
frequency  bands are consistent  with those found in the 0.01–0.08  Hz 
band (see inline Supplementary  Figure S1). Additionally,  we applied  
Carson’s  empirical  rule ( Carson,  1922 ; Pachaud  et al., 2013 ) on the an- 
alytical  signal which was calculated  using the Hilbert transform  of the 
real signal ( Gabor, 1946 ), to conﬁrm  non-violation  of the Bedrosian  the- 
orem for our bandpassed  signals (see inline Supplementary  Figure S2). 
Phase synchronization  measures  
We investigated  two complementary  phase synchronization  mea- 
sures based on phase and phase diﬀerence.  Instantaneous  phase 𝜃( 𝑡 ) is 
obtained  from the analytical  signal. We deﬁne phase synchrony  (PS) 
as the magnitude  of the Kuramoto  order parameter  ( Acebrón  et al., 
2005 ; Cabral et al., 2011 ; Deco et al., 2017, 2018 ; Shanahan,  2010 ). 
This has also been referred  to by other authors  as Phase Coherence  
( Breakspear  et al., 2010 ; Váš a et al., 2015 ). For any brain region M of r 
parcels at time t , PS is then deﬁned  as 
𝑃 𝑆 𝑀 ( 𝑡 ) = |||⟨𝑒 𝑖 θ( 𝑟,𝑡 ) ⟩|||, 𝑟 ∈𝑀 (1) 
Phase synchrony  measures  the degree of synchronization  across the 
brain region M, at time t and is bound between  0 and 1. 
Phase synchrony  is distinct  from phase coherence  (PC) as used in 
( Pedersen  et al., 2018 ). PC is related to phase diﬀerence,  is measured  as 
( 1 − |sin (Δ𝜃( 𝑡 ) |), and is bound between  0 and 1. PC was not used in this 
study. 
We deﬁne phase-locking  (PL) as the cosine of the relative  phase 
( Alonso Martínez  et al., 2020 ; Cabral et al., 2017 ; Deco et al., 2019 , 2017a; Figueroa  et al., 2019 ; Honari et al., 2021 ; Lord et al., 2019 ; 
Vohryzek  et al., 2020 ) 
PL ( 𝑛, 𝑝, 𝑡 ) = cos ( Δ𝜃( 𝑛, 𝑝, 𝑡 ) ) 
where 
Δ𝜃( 𝑡 ) = (𝜃( 𝑛, 𝑡 ) − 𝜃( 𝑝, 𝑡 ) ), the phase diﬀerence  between  regions  n and p . 
(2) 
Phase-locking  is a measure  of synchronization  that preserves  positive  
and negative  dependence  in the data, that is, in-phase  locking  and anti- 
phase locking.  Phase locking  is bound between  − 1 and + 1. 
Phase-locking  is distinct  from phase locking  value (PLV) as used in 
( Ponce-Alvarez  et al., 2015 ). PLV measures  the magnitude  (absolute  
value) of the Δθ(t) and is bound between  0 and 1, and was not used 
in this study. 
The behavior  of phase synchrony  and phase-locking  between  2 sig- 
nals is illustrated  in Fig. 1 , where the phase of one signal (A) shifts away 
from the phase of a reference  signal. 
Functional  connectivity  through  phase-locking  
We estimated  functional  connectivity  (FC) with the nonlinear  mea- 
sure of phase-locking  which may be more suitable  than linear mea- 
sures such as Pearson  correlation  for analyzing  complex  brain dynamics.  
Speciﬁcally,  phase synchronization  measures  are not aﬀected  by ampli- 
tude variability  between  subjects  ( Glerean  et al., 2012 ), and nonlinear  
methods  provide  insight into interdependence  between  brain regions  at 
both short and large time and spatial scales allowing  the analysis  of com- 
plex nonlinear  interactions  across space and time ( Pereda et al., 2005 ; 
Quian Quiroga  et al., 2002 ). From a practical  perspective,  unlike corre- 
lation or covariance  measures,  phase synchronization  can be estimated  
at the instantaneous  level and does not require  time-windowing.  When 
averaged  over a suﬃciently  long time window,  phase-locking  values 
provide  a close approximation  to Pearson  correlation,  varying  within 
the same range of values ( Cabral et al., 2017 ; Honari et al., 2021 ). 
Indeed,  a variety of phase synchronization  measures  have been lever- 
aged in dFC studies to date. An overview  presenting  the range of studies,  
and the phase synchronization  measure  assessed  in those studies,  is pre- 
sented in Supplementary  Table ST2. 
Following  ( Cabral et al., 2017 ), we ﬁrst calculated  the analytical  sig- 
nal using the Hilbert transform  of the real signal ( Gabor, 1946 ). Then, 
the instantaneous  phase-locking  between  each pair of brain regions  n 
and p was estimated  for each time-point  t as the cosine diﬀerence  of the 
relative  phase as 
𝑖𝑃 𝐿 ( 𝑛, 𝑝, 𝑡 ) = cos ( θ( 𝑛, 𝑡 ) − θ( 𝑝, 𝑡 ) ) (3) 
Phase-locking  at a given timepoint  ranges between  − 1 (regions  in anti- 
phase) and 1 (regions  in-phase).  For each subject the resulting  iPL was 
a three-dimensional  tensor of size NxNxT where N is the dimension  of 
the parcellation,  and T is the number  of timepoints  in the scan. 
LEiDA –leading  eigenvector  dynamic  analysis  
To reduce the dimensionality  of the phase-locking  space for our dy- 
namic analysis,  we employed  the Leading  Eigenvector  Dynamic  Analysis  
(LEiDA)  ( Cabral et al., 2017 ) method.  The leading  eigenvector  V 1 (t) of 
each iPL(t) is the eigenvector  with the largest magnitude  eigenvalue  and 
reﬂects  the dominant  FC (through  phase-locking)  pattern  at time t. V 1 (t) 
is a Nx1 vector that captures  the main orientation  of the fMRI signal 
phases over all anatomical  areas. Each element  in V 1 (t) represents  the 
projection  of the fMRI phase in each region into the leading  eigenvector.  
When all elements  of V 1 (t) have the same sign, this means that all fMRI 
phases are orientated  in the same direction  as V 1 (t) indicating  a global 
mode governing  all fMRI signals.  When the elements  of V 1 (t) have both 
positive  and negative  signs, this means that the fMRI signals have diﬀer- 
ent orientations,  behaving  like opposite  anti-nodes  in a standing  wave.

Fig. 1. Two complementary  phase synchronization  measures  for the calculation  of dFC metrics.  
Phase synchrony  (PS) reﬂects the degree of synchronization  between  the two signals, whilst phase-locking  (PL), evaluated  as the cosine of the relative phase, reﬂects 
phase alignment  and is sensitive  to both in-phase  and anti-phase  relationships  between  the two signals. 
This allows us to separate  the brain regions  into two ‘communities’  (or 
poles) according  to their orientation  or sign, where the magnitude  of 
each element  in V 1 (t) indicates  the strength  of belonging  to that com- 
munity  ( Newman,  2006 ). For more details and graphical  representation  
see ( Figueroa  et al., 2019 ; Lord et al., 2019 ; Vohryzek  et al., 2020 ). The 
outer product  of V 1 (t) reveals the FC matrix associated  with the leading  
eigenvector  at time 𝑡 . 
Mode extraction  
To identify  recurring  spatiotemporal  modes 𝜓or phase-locking  pat- 
terns, we clustered  the leading  eigenvectors  for each run with K-means  
clustering  with 300 replications  and up to 400 iterations  for 2–10 cen- 
troids considering  116 and 90 (i.e., excluding  the cerebellum)  anatom-  
ical regions.  K-means  clustering  returns a set of K central vectors  or 
centroids  in the form of Nx1 vectors  V c . As V c is a mean derived  vari- 
able, it may not occur in any individual  subject data set. To obtain time 
courses  related to the extracted  modes 𝜓 𝑘 at each TR we assign the clus- 
ter number  to which V(t) is most similar using the cosine distance.  
Mode visualization  
We rendered  the centroid  vectors  V c in cortical  space by representing  
each element  as a sphere placed at the center of gravity of the relevant  
brain region, and scaling the color of the spheres  according  to the value 
of the relevant  eigenvector.  Regions  with similar phase orientation  are 
colored  alike (yellow-to-red  for the smallest  community  and cyan-to-  
blue for the largest community),  where darker colors (red/blue)  indicate  
weak contributions  and lighter colors (cyan/yellow)  indicate  stronger  
contributions.  We also plot links between  the corresponding  areas to 
highlight  the network  formed  by the smallest  community  of brain areas 
(see Supplementary  Figure S5). 
Cluster representation  in voxel space 
To obtain a visualization  in voxel space of the spatial modes V c we 
ﬁrst reduced  the spatial resolution  of all fMRI volumes  from 2mm 3 to 
10mm 3 to obtain a reduced  number  of brain voxels (here N = 1821 ) 
to be able to compute  the eigenvectors  of the NxN phase-locking  matri- 
ces. The analytic  signal of each 10mm 3 voxel was computed  using the 
Hilbert transform,  and the leading  eigenvectors  were obtained  at each 
time point (with size NxT ). Subsequently,  the eigenvectors  were aver- 
aged across all time instances  assigned  to a particular  cluster,  obtaining  
in this way, for each cluster,  a 1xN vector representative  of the mean 
phase-locking  pattern  captured  in voxel space. Measures  and metrics 
The following  sections  provide  an accessible  overview  of the mea- 
sures and metrics  used in this study. Detailed  mathematical  treatment  
and explanations  for all metrics  may be found in Supplementary  meth- 
ods and metrics.  Each metric has found application  in either theoretical

2.1. Participants  
22 young adults (19–22 years old, mean age = 20.18 + /- 0.80 years, 
11 male, 11 female)  completed  the cued task-switching  experiment,  pro- 
viding the data analyzed  in this report. All participants  provided  writ- 
ten informed  consent,  reported  no diagnosed  neurological  conditions,  
no recent head injuries,  normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision, and that 
they were not suﬀering  experience  post-concussive  syndrome.  All proce- 
dures were approved  by the University  of Rochester  Institutional  Review  Board (STUDY00001952).  Participants  were paid $15/h for time spent 
in the lab. 
2.2. Stimuli and task 
Participants  performed  the cognitive  task while either sitting, or 
walking  on a treadmill  (TuﬀTread,  Conroe,  TX, USA). Each trial com- 
prised a 100 ms cue, a 650 ms cue-target  interval  (CTI), a 100 ms tar- 
get stimulus,  and a 1000–1200  ms post target interval  (PTI). A central-  
ﬁxation  cross was held on-screen  continuously  throughout  each block. 
All visual task elements  were projected  on a screen 2.2 m (during  seated 
blocks)  in front of the participant.  A black or white annulus  encircling  
the central-ﬁxation  cross served as a cue on each trial, instructing  par- 
ticipants  to perform  the spatial frequency  discrimination  or the orien- 
tation discrimination  task respectively.  Target stimuli comprised  two 
bivalent  images (diﬀering  in both orientation,  and spatial frequency)  
presented  to the left and right of the central ﬁxation  cross. Based on the 
location  of the treadmill,  the target eccentricity  was 6.4°during  sitting 
blocks. Trials in which two identical  stimuli were presented  ( “replace  tri- 
als ”) occurred  pseudorandomly  throughout  both pure and mixed blocks 
of the experiment.  Target stimuli pairs were pseudorandomly  selected  
from a 5 ×5 matrix of images ( Fig. 1 B) to ensure incongruent  task re- 
sponse mappings  to the left- and right-hand  response  devices  (2 Nin- 
tendo Switch Joy-Con  TM controllers).  Two stimuli representing  the pair- 
ing of the greatest  rotation  with the highest  spatial frequency,  and the 
pairing  of the least rotation  with the lowest spatial frequency  were in- 
eligible  for selection  on any non-replace  trial, leaving  a total of 200 
possible  stimulus  pairings.  Cues were delivered  during both pure blocks 
(non-informative)  and mixed blocks (informative).  Cues would repeat a 
minimum  of 4 times, after which the probability  of a cue switch would 
increase  on each subsequent  trial. A maximum  of 6 cue repetitions  (1 
switch trial + 5 repeats)  were permitted.  A minimum  of 4 pure blocks 
were administered,  2 seated, 2 walking.  A minimum  of 10 mixed blocks 
were administered  (5 seated, 5 walking).  2 walking  only blocks (walk- 
ing without  performing  the cognitive  task) were also administered  at 
3  D.P. Richardson,  J.J. Foxe, K.A. Mazurek et al. NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118853 
pseudorandom  intervals.  A central ﬁxation  cross was held on screen dur- 
ing walking  only blocks, but subjects  did not perform  a cognitive  task. 
Walking  and Sitting blocks were selected  pseudorandomly,  such that a 
maximum  of 3 sitting or walking  blocks could occur consecutively.

Results  
Imagery  recall 
A total of 28 adult participants  were assessed  (Suppl.  Table S1). We 
ﬁrst determined  the degree of Imagery  Recall (i.e., presence  or absence  
of imagery)  for the diﬀerent  sleep-wake  stages. Although  Imagery  Re- 
call was quite high across stages, a signiﬁcant  increase  was detected  as 
participants  transited  from WK to N1, as hypothesized  (WK: 75.1 %; 
N1: 87.4 %, N2: 80.4 %, Chi-square  p = 0.0001 for WK vs. N1, other 
comparisons  were not signiﬁcant,  Fig. 2 a). When all trials from WK, 
N1, and N2 were pooled,  Imagery  Recall was related to longer peri- 
ods with eyes closed, in comparison  with ‘No Recall’ trials (Wilcoxon  
Ranksum,  p = 0.0067,  Fig. 2 b). In other words, the longer the partici-  
pants processed  the image with eyes closed, the more likely they were 
to produce  an imagery  report thereafter.  This eﬀect was not detected  
for any speciﬁc  stage (WK p = 0.0862;  N1 p = 0.6881;  N2 p = 0.6583).  
No diﬀerences  related to sleep oscillations  were found between  trials 
with and without  Imagery  Recall (Wilcoxon  Ranksum  p values: Ver- 
tex: N1 = 0.3086,  N2 = 0.8876;  Spindles:  N2 = 0.4178;  K Complexes:  
N2 = 0.6372).  
Image and aﬀect residue 
To characterize  the ‘day residue’  within each stage, Image Residue  
and Aﬀect Residue  were compared  with their corresponding  random-  
ized values. Image Residue  values were higher than random  levels across 
stages (Wilcoxon  Ranksum,  p < 0.0001 for the three stages considered,  
Fig. 2 c, Suppl. Table S3), while Aﬀect Residue  values were similar to 
random  values for WK and N1, and lower than random  levels at N2 
(Wilcoxon  Ranksum,  p < 0.0001,  Fig. 2 c, Suppl. Table S3). Next, we 
evaluated  whether  the Image or Aﬀect Residues  diﬀered  signiﬁcantly  
across stages. This occurred  only for Aﬀect Residue  (Kruskal-Wallis  
p = 0.0051,  Suppl. Table S2), which was higher in WK trials than in 
N2 trials ( Fig. 2 c, Wilcoxon  Ranksum  p = 0.0010,  Suppl. Table S3). 
Image Residue  showed  no signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  across stages ( Fig. 2 c, 
Suppl. Table S3). Although  there were no Image Residue  diﬀerences  
across stages, exclusively  for N1 there was a signiﬁcant  and positive  
correlation  with time spent with eyes closed (Spearman  Rho = 0.29, 
p < 0.0001,  Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). Interestingly,  also for N1 only there was 
a signiﬁcant  negative  correlation  between  Aﬀect Residue  and time with 
eyes closed (Spearman  Rho = -0.20, p = 0.0033,  Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). There 
were no signiﬁcant  correlations  between  sleep biomarkers  and either Image or Aﬀect Residues  ( Table 1 ). There were no word count diﬀer- 
ences between  eyes open and eyes closed for stages N1 and N2, but 
there was a signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  during WK (Suppl.  Table S4). Further-  
more, across the three stages of interest  there were signiﬁcant  positive  
correlations  between  Image Residue  and word count, with eyes open as 
well as closed (Suppl.  Table S4). Thus, the more the participant  talked 
about both image and imagery,  the greater was the similarity  between  
their imagetic  contents.  In contrast,  there were no signiﬁcant  correla-  
tions between  word count and Aﬀect Residue  (Suppl.  Table S4). 
Next, we sought to describe  the dynamics  of aﬀective  valences  be- 
tween Image and Imagery,  and the relationship  between  their residues.  
We found a positive  correlation  between  the aﬀective  valences  of Image 
and Imagery  in WK and N1 trials, with the strongest  eﬀect in WK tri- 
als (Spearman  correlation,  WK Rho = 0.39, p < 0.0001;  N1 Rho = 0.25, 
p = 0.0003;  N2 Rho = 0.17, p = 0.0635;  Fig. 3 a). In addition  to the rescal- 
ing (rank preservation  as indicated  by positive  Spearman  correlations)  
of the aﬀective  valences,  we observed  a neutralization  of the aﬀective  
valences  for Imagery,  in comparison  with Image (Fig. 3b; Kolmogorov-  
Smirnov  test for aﬀective  valence  distributions  for WK p < 0.0001,  N1 
p = 0.0005,  and N2 p < 0.0001,  with Bonferroni  correction  for 3 com- 
parisons,  𝛼= 0.016).  
For the three states considered,  the variance  of the aﬀect scores de- 
creased  from the image report (eyes open) to the imagery  report (eyes 
closed),  reﬂecting  aﬀect neutralization  (mean ± variance:  from 5.13 ± 
2.49 to 5.57 ± 1.82 in WK; 5.11 ± 2.45 to 5.42 ± 1.62 in N1; 5.41 ± 
2.65 to 5.18 ± 1.44 in N2). To further characterize  this neutralization,  
we counted  the amount  of neutral  aﬀective  valence  grades and com- 
pared the frequency  after the visualization  of image (eyes open) or im- 
agery (eyes closed).  As shown in Fig. 3 c, there was signiﬁcant  aﬀective  
neutralization  for imagery  obtained  within WK, N1 and N2. In addition,  
the entropies  of the distributions  dropped  substantially  from Image to 
Imagery,  with the strongest  eﬀect within N2 ( Fig. 3 d). There was no 
signiﬁcant  correlation  between  Image and Aﬀect Residue,  nor between  
Image Residue  and the aﬀective  valences  of Image or Imagery,  neither  
when considering  all trials, nor when considering  speciﬁc  stages (Rho 
values ranging  from -0.12 to 0.7, p > 0.05). 
Power spectrum  density versus Image or Aﬀect Residue  
In contrast  with aﬀective  valences,  the visual contents  were far from 
neutralized  in Imagery,  which produced  a semantically  rich set of re- 
ports and a wide dynamic  range of Image Residues  ( Fig. 1 c, correlation  
matrix).  To gain insight into the neural correlates  of the Image Residue  
at sleep onset, we investigated  how Image Residue  related to EEG oscil- 
lations and power spectrum  density  within the 20s interval  before each 
beep that terminated  the WK, N1 and N2 trials. 
First, we assessed  the correlations  of Image Residue  with the abun- 
dance of vertex sharp-waves,  cortical  spindles,  or K complexes.  Contrary  
to our expectations  for cortical  spindles,  no signiﬁcant  correlations  were 
detected  ( Table 1 ). Similar  results were observed  for Aﬀect Residues  
( Table 1 ). 
Next, we assessed  the correlations  of Image and Aﬀect Residues  with 
EEG power within speciﬁc  frequency  bands. Well-established  EEG spec- 
tral markers  of the target stages were observed,  such as the robust occip- 
ital alpha (8.5-10.5  Hz) power during WK, the surge of theta power (4.5- 
8.5 Hz) during N1, and the drop in EEG power for frequencies  > 8.5 Hz 
during N2 (Suppl.  Fig. S1). During WK there were signiﬁcant  negative  
correlations  between  Image Residue  and power in both the theta (4.5 to 
6.5 Hz) and low beta (14.5-16.5)  bands, with signiﬁcant  positive  corre- 
lations between  Image Residue  and power in the high beta band (24.5 
to 28.5Hz)  ( Fig. 4 a). During N1 there were signiﬁcant  negative  correla-  
tions between  Image Residue  and power in the theta band (4.5 to 6.5Hz),  
as well as signiﬁcant  positive  correlations  between  Image Residue  and 
power in the high beta band (22.5 to 28.5Hz).  No signiﬁcant  correla-  
tions were detected  during N2. Although  there was an overall similarity  
of WK and N1 regarding  the correlations  between  Image Residue  and

between  empathy  and personal  distress  seems to be mediated  by low 
capacities  to control own emotions  ( Kim and Han, 2018 ; Buruck et al., 
2014 ; Powell,  2018 ). Taken together,  these studies suggest  that emo- 
tional empathy  comes at an “emotional  cost ”f o r the observer,  i.e., 
higher personal  distress  levels, which can be overcome  by emotion  reg- 
ulation ( Buruck et al., 2014 ; Powell,  2018 ), which then could facili- 
tate helping  behavior  ( De Waal and Preston,  2017 ; Decety and Jack- 
son, 2004 ; Lebowitz  and Dovidio,  2015 ). 
Interestingly,  when confronted  with another  person who is in an 
emotionally  aversive  situation  in which we are also engaged,  people 
frequently  and readily regulate  this other person’s  emotional  state, for 
example  by calming  or comforting  them. This process  has been referred  
to as social, interpersonal  or other emotion  regulation  ( Niven et al., 
2009 ; Zaki and Williams,  2013 ) and has only relatively  recently  received  
attention  in social cognitive  neuroscience  ( Zaki and Williams,  2013 ; 
Reeck et al., 2016 ). In the context  of the aforementioned  reaction  of 
personal  distress  (and the need for self emotion  regulation)  when seeing 
somebody  in despair,  it seems in fact surprising  that so many individu-  
als would engage in regulating  others as this represents  a further con- 
frontation  with the other person’s  intense  emotional  state, which might 
increase  the burden for the self, i.e. personal  distress.  One study in medi- 
cal students  indeed seems to suggest  just that: regulating  another  person 
depleted  emotional  resources  in the regulator,  which was shown to in- 
crease emotional  exhaustion  ( Martínez-Íñigo  et al., 2015 ). Interestingly  
though,  there is conﬂicting  evidence  reporting  that regulating  other’s 
emotions  can actually  increase  the regulator’s  well-being  ( Niven et al., 
2012 ). Thus, it is an open question  how social emotion  regulation  is 
related to own emotional  wellbeing.  Given the pervasiveness  of regu- 
lating others in social interactions  ( Ham and Tronick,  2009 ), however,  
we propose  here that regulating  other’s emotions  might have beneﬁcial  
eﬀects on the regulation  of one’s own emotional  state. 
Neuroimaging  studies of recent years have sought to contribute  to 
an understanding  of social emotion  regulation  and its relationship  to 
self emotion  regulation.  These initial studies,  which utilized  paradigms  
where people inside a Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI) scanner  reg- 
ulated a person outside  of it, have shown that other emotion  regula- 
tion identiﬁed  overlaps  in brain areas mediating  self emotion  regula- 
tion, including  activity  in prefrontal  cortex (PFC) ( Hallam  et al., 2014 ; 
Jensen et al., 2014 ). Moreover,  social emotion  regulation  was shown to 
involve  the temporo-parietal  junction  (TPJ) and the precuneus,  which 
have been taken to indicate  social cognition  processes  ( Hallam  et al., 
2014 ; Jensen et al., 2014 ). However,  studies to date seem limited by 
small sample sizes ( Jensen et al., 2014 ) and did not directly  asses the 
emotional  state (i.e., distress  levels) of the regulator  while regulating  
another  person.  
Thus, in the current  partly explorative  study we sought to further 
elucidate  the relationship  between  self and other emotion  regulation  on 
a behavior  and brain level, and more speciﬁcally  set out to test the hy- 
pothesis  that regulating  others’ adverse  emotional  states contributes  and 
leads to regulating  personal  distress,  compared  with permiting  other’s 
emotions.  Furthermore,  we sought to explore  whether  levels of trait 
emotional  empathy  moderate  emotion  regulation  capacities,  hypothe-  
sizing that subjects  with higher emotional  empathy  will display  higher 
personal  distress  when regulating  self and others. At the neuronal  level, 
we predicted  that contrasting  other versus self ER would lead to in- 
creased  brain activation  in the TPJ and the precuneus,  thus indicative  
of socio-cognitive  processes  at work, while the conjunction  of both con- 
trasts would reveal more generic  ER regions,  like the dorso-lateral  PFC, 
dorso-medial  PFC, superior  parietal  cortex, which have been shown in- 
volved equally  in self and other ER ( Hallam  et al., 2014 ; Jensen et al., 
2014 ; Kohn et al., 2014 ). To further investigate  psycho-physiological  
interactions  during self and other ER more exploratory,  we investigated  
how self-reported  stress and arousal  as indicated  by SCR would covary 
with brain regions  mediating  socio-cognitive  and emotion  regulation.  
To evaluate  these questions,  we developed  a new self and other emo- 
tion regulation  task, in which subjects  had to alternate  between  regulat-  ing their own emotions  and regulating  the emotions  of another  person 
(an unfamiliar  confederate)  outside  of the MRI scanner,  while being ex- 
posed to aversive  pictures.  To investigate  the success  of emotion  regu- 
lation, i.e., cognitive  reappraisal,  we used self-report  stress ratings and 
electrodermal  activity  as a measure  of sympathetic  activation.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Sixty-two  healthy  individuals  (52 female,  mean age = 38.5 years, 
sd = 10) were recruited  from the general  population  in the city of Berlin 
in the context  of a longitudinal  intervention  study on the eﬀects of a 
Mindfulness-based  Stress Reduction  (MBSR)  program,  pre-registered  at 
clinicaltrials.gov  NCT03035669.  Only data that were collected  before 
randomization  into the longitudinal  study will be reported  here and 
longitudinal  data will be reported  on elsewhere  (Guendelman  et al., in 
preparation).  Subjects  underwent  an online and in-person  screening  pro- 
cedure,  and reported  no history of neurological  or psychiatric  disorders,  
no current  use of psychoactive  drugs, native German  ﬂuency,  normal  
or corrected-to-normal  vision and no contra-indication  for performing  
an fMRI experiment.  All participants  provided  written  informed  consent  
prior to the investigation.  The study was approved  by the ethics commit-  
tee of Humboldt-Universität  zu Berlin and was carried out in accordance  
with the guidelines  of the declaration  of Helsinski.  
2.2. Procedure  
Subjects  underwent  the Self-other  emotion  regulation  paradigm  
(SORT)  in the context  of an fMRI experiment  on day one and completed  
various  socio-emotional  measures  on day two. On the day of the fMRI 
experiment,  participants  were asked to arrive 1 hour early to the neu- 
roimaging  center and to wait for approx.  15 min in the waiting  room 
with a confederate  of the investigator,  who was unknown  to the partici-  
pant and introduced  to them as another  subject and their partner  for the 
upcoming  session.  Both persons  were treated as experimental  subjects  
by the experimenter  team and were told that they were going to do the 
same task together,  one in the scanner  and one outside  of it. Both sub- 
jects were given the experimental  instructions  and took a trial version  
of the paradigm  before completing  the actual task.

Early studies on resting state functional  connectivity  (RSFC) analy- 
sis of fMRI data have revealed  two anticorrelated  brain networks  ( Fox 
et al., 2005; Fransson,  2005 ) working  in tandem  with each other. One 
is the DMN also known as the task-negative  network  ( Greicius  and 
Menon,  2004 ), while the other network,  which is negatively  correlated  
to the DMN in resting state, comprised  of the superior  parietal  lobule 
(SPL), intraparietal  sulcus (IPS), frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF), and ventral 
premotor  cortex is called the Dorsal Attention  Network  (DAN). The net- 
works themselves  are strongly  correlated  within and anticorrelated  to 
each other ( Fox et al., 2005 ). The DAN is involved  in attention  de- 
manding  extrinsic  tasks whereas  the DMN is found to be activated  dur- 
ing internal  self-referential  processing  ( Andrews-Hanna,  2012 ). Subse- 
quent studies found that the behavior  of the DMN was more nuanced  
than what was originally  thought  ( Greicius  and Menon,  2004; Mckier-  
nan et al., 2003 ). The anticorrelations  between  DMN and DAN were 
found to be aﬀected  by cognitive  states, changed  across default sub- 
systems  and aﬀected  by preprocessing  methods  ( Dixon et al., 2017 ). 
People with disorders  like ADHD, Parkinson’s  disease,  Alzheimer’s  have 
shown to have diﬀerential  connectivity  in the DMN which can be al- 
tered using drugs ( Mohan et al., 2016 ). The recent use of continuous  
attention  tasks demonstrated  a complex  dynamics  between  DAN-DMN  
activity  with task load and attentional  control ( Esterman  et al., 2013 ). 
Another  study found variable  dynamics  of the DMN-DAN  interactions  
which are altered by the frontoparietal  control network  (FPCN)  ( Dixon 
et al., 2017; Nathan  Spreng et al., 2014 ). LFP power computed  using di- 
rect neuronal  recordings  of cat found anticorrelated  DMN-DAN  activity  
which was modulated  by state, more prominent  in waking  and paradox-  
ical sleep than in slow-wave  sleep ( Popa et al., 2009 ). 
Recent work has suggested  that DMN may not be a single network  
but composed  of three diﬀerent  subsystems  ( Andrews-Hanna  et al., 
2010; Buckner  et al., 2008; Christoﬀet  al., 2016 ). The exact functions  
of each of these DMN subsystems  is still a subject of active research.  
Ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex (vmPFC)  reﬂects  the emotional  state 
of the subject whereas  the dorsal medial PFC (dmPFC)  is engaged  in 
self-referential  judgements  and the activity  between  both the regions  
are anti-correlated  suggesting  diﬀerence  in the times when these re- 
gions are activated  ( Raichle,  2015 ) The posterior  regions  of the DMN 
are more associated  with autobiographical  memory,  emotional  and self- 
referential  processing  ( Christoﬀ et  al., 2016; Raichle,  2015 ). The MTL 
subsystem  of the DMN is engaged  during mnemonic  processes,  auto- 
biographical  memories  and recollection  based tasks ( Andrews-Hanna,  
2012; Andrews-Hanna  et al., 2010 ). The PCC and the anterior  mPFC 
has shown hub like properties  as analysed  using functional  connec-  
tivity. Some studies have shown that not only there are multiple  net- 
works but these are tightly interwoven  across the three large subsys-  
tems ( Braga and Buckner,  2017; Buckner  and DiNicola,  2019; DiNicola  
et al., 2020 ). More recent works have identiﬁed  further subdivisions  of 
the DMN based either using group aggregate  RSFC analysis  ( Andrews-  
Hanna et al., 2010; Barnett  et al., 2021; Kernbach  et al., 2018 ) or indi- 
vidual speciﬁc  precision  RSFC analysis  ( Gordon  et al., 2020 ). 
More recent studies have found DMN regions  to be activated  dur- 
ing speciﬁc  goal-directed  behavior  ( Nathan  Spreng et al., 2014; Spreng 
and Grady, 2010 ) involving  internally  oriented  tasks such as autobio-  
graphical  recall ( Cabeza  and St Jacques,  2007 ), imagination  of hypo- 
thetical  future scenarios  ( Schacter  et al., 2007; Spreng et al., 2009 ), 
tasks requiring  information  from past trials ( Murphy  et al., 2019 ), so- 
cial cognition  ( Lieberman,  2007 ), social working  memory  ( Meyer et al., 
2012 ), Theory-of-mind  tasks ( Schurz et al., 2014 ), changes  in cogni- 
tive context  in internally  as well as externally  focused  tasks ( Crittenden  
et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2020 ) (see Buckner  and 
DiNicola,  2019 for a recent review).  Studies  that use naturalistic  stimuli 
to study patterns  of activity  in the brain ( Hasson,  2004; Hasson  et al., 
2008; Simony  et al., 2016 ) using methods  like Intersubject  correlation  
(ISC) and Intersubject  functional  correlations  (ISFC) have found that the 
DMN reconﬁgures  from task-negative  to task-positive  during naturalistic  
stimuli.  While the research  on the exact role of DMN is still ongoing,  three 
hypotheses  about DMN function  have emerged  ( Buckner  et al., 2008; 
Smith et al., 2018 ). According  to the sentinel hypothesis  , the DMN plays 
a role in monitoring  the external  environment  ( Gusnard  and Raichle,  
2001; Shulman  et al., 1997 ) and when presented  with an active task re- 
quiring  focused  attention,  the brain directs its inner resources  to attend- 
ing the task, while temporarily  suspending  the environment  monitoring.  
According  to the internal  mentation  hypothesis,  the DMN directly  con- 
tributes  to internal  mentation  such as self-reﬂective  thoughts  and judge- 
ments ( Andrews-Hanna,  2012; Tripathi  and Bharadwaj,  2021 ). When 
presented  with an attention  demanding  task, the internal  mentation  is 
temporarily  suspended  to attend to the task. Recent studies have put 
forward  the context encoding  hypothesis  according  to which the DMN 
actively  encodes  both internal  as well as external  context  information  
( Smith et al., 2018 ). This encoding  may weaken  when similar cognitive  
operations  are repeated  leading  to deactivation  in DMN. Whenever  there 
is context  switching,  either due to mind wandering  or due to external  
tasks, the DMN is likely to become  activated  ( Crittenden  et al., 2015; 
Smith et al., 2018; Sormaz  et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2020 ). 
Since the DMN has been implicated  in task-unconstrained  thoughts,  
mind wandering  as well as rumination  ( Christoﬀ et  al., 2009; 2016; 
Nathan  Spreng,  2012 ), frontoparietal  control network  is involved  in 
modulating  the activity  in DMN ( Nathan  Spreng et al., 2014 ), we hy- 
pothesize  that the deactivation  of DMN will not be strictly stimulus  
locked for most tasks. Due to extrinsic  attention  processes  modulating  
the activation  and deactivations  of DMN regions,  its activity  may exhibit 
signiﬁcant  trial-to-trial  and subject-to-subject  variability.  We therefore  
hypothesize  the BOLD signal to exhibit poor stimulus-locked  inter-trial  
and inter-subject  synchronization  in the DMN regions  as compared  to 
the early sensory  and task positive  regions.  
In order to test this hypothesis,  we designed  a new method  called the 
Temporal  Synchronization  Analysis  (TSA) which can be applied  to mul- 
tiple trials within a subject or across subjects  to determine  the synchro-  
nization  of the BOLD response  of diﬀerent  voxels (across trials or sub- 
jects) in the brain. We discover  that the DMN regions  have weaker  inter- 
trial and inter-subject  stimulus-locked  synchronization  as compared  to 
task-positive  regions  and early sensory  processing  regions.  These results 
have been found to be consistent  across four very diﬀerent  data sets in- 
volving  visual-auditory  valence,  language,  craving,  risk, emotion,  the- 
ory of mind and texture matching  tasks. Our results demonstrate  that 
the dynamics  of regions  like DMN need to be studied  using newer sta- 
tistical methods.  Our method  can be used to create a metric to quantify  
the stimulus-locked  DMN synchronization  which may be related to the 
quality of attention  control in individuals  and predict performance  in 
cognitive  tasks across diﬀerent  populations.  These results indicate  that 
the BOLD response  in DMN regions  (and possibly  other brain regions)  
are much more nuanced  than the simple task-positive  or task-negative  
response  as quantiﬁed  by the GLM analysis.  Statistical  methods  such 
as TSA can unravel  such subtle BOLD activity,  opening  up frontiers  for 
newer discoveries  about brain function.  
2. Methods  
To compare  the synchronization  across subjects,  following  publicly  
available  datasets  related to diﬀerent  cognitive  modalities  were used 
which had the same stimulus  onset times and stimuli proﬁles  across the 
subjects.  
2.1. Dataset 
Datasets  Used: 
• Food vs Non Food (FNF) : Photos of food and non-food  items were 
shown to 30 subjects  to test craving  for food items. Each run had 16 
blocks with a 30-second  block length and TR of 1.6 s ( Smeets et al., 
2013 ). 
2  V. Tripathi and R. Garg NeuroImage  251 (2022) 118940 
• Aﬀective  Videos  (AV) : Eleven subjects  were shown audiovisual  
stimuli of various  emotional  valences.  Each block had 5 s of the stim- 
ulus with 7 s of ﬁxation.  TR was 2.2 s ( Kim et al., 2016 ). 
• Bilingual  words (BW) : Cross-Language  repetition  priming  was 
tested on 13 bilingual  subjects  ( Poldrack  et al., 2013 ) who were 
shown words of various  levels of diﬃculty  in Spanish  and English,  
and they had to rate whether  they know it or not. It was a trial based 
task with 1.5 s of stimulus  with around 1–6 s of ﬁxation  and TR of 
2 s. 
• Human  Connectome  Project  (HCP) : 169 subjects  with four tasks 
from the HCP Young Adult dataset ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ) are used: 
Social, Emotion,  Gambling  and Relational.  These subjects  had both 
7T and 3T acquisition  and scanned  for all seven tasks along with 
resting-state  and movie watching  dataset.  The four tasks are block- 
based with 15–25 s duration  per block and meant to activate  various  
task speciﬁc  regions.  In the Social task, subjects  viewed  20 s videos 
where objects (circles,  squares  and triangles)  interacted  with each 
other (social condition)  or moved around randomly  (random  con- 
dition) and subjects  had to detect whether  the objects had a social 
interaction,  no interaction  or not sure. In the Emotion  tasks, sub- 
jects were either presented  with faces (angry or fearful expression)  
or shapes and they had to decide which of the two faces or shapes at 
the bottom  of the screen matches  the face or shape at the top of the 
screen. The Gambling  task involved  subjects  playing  a card guessing  
game and subjects  had to guess if the mystery  card is greater or less 
than 5. In the Relational  task, subjects  viewed  two pairs of stimuli 
on top and bottom  of the screen which diﬀered  either by shape or 
texture.  Subjects  had to analyse  if the top pair diﬀer along one di- 
mension  and then respond  if the bottom  pair diﬀer along the same 
dimension  or not. In the control condition,  subjects  would see a pair 
of stimuli on the top and one stimuli on the bottom  of the screen 
and were given a cue of dimension  (shape or texture)  to attend and 
respond  if the bottom  object matched  with either of the top objects 
in the given dimension.  Kindly refer to ( Barch et al., 2013 ) for more 
details on the tasks and analysis.  
Study details,  participants  and MRI acquisition  can be referred  to in- 
dividual  papers ( Kim et al., 2016; Poldrack  et al., 2013; Smeets et al., 
2013; Van Essen et al., 2013 ) Informed  consent  was obtained  from all 
subjects.  The FNF study was approved  by the Medical  Ethical Com- 
mittee of the University  Medical  Center Utrecht,  The Netherlands,  the 
AV study by the Institutional  Review  Board at the University  of South 
Carolina  and HCP study by Washington  University  institutional  review 
board. The datasets  are publicly  available  on openneuro.org  with acces- 
sion numbers  ds000157,  ds000205  and ds000051  for FNF, AV and BW 
respectively  and on ConnectomeDB  ( https://db.humanconnectome.org  ) 
for the HCP dataset.  
2.2. Preprocessing  
We used FSL for preprocessing  ( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ). The 
brain was extracted  from the high resolution  structural  ﬁle (1 mm 
isotropic)  using a repeated  version  of the FSL-BET.  Slice-time  cor- 
rection,  motion correction,  temporal  high-pass  ﬁltering  (100 s), spa- 
tial smoothing  with 6 mm FWHM was done on all datasets.  This 
was followed  by co-registration  across the dataset and normalization  
with an MNI 2 mm template.  For the HCP dataset,  we used the al-

2.2. Dataset 
We used the openly available  Multi-Domain  Task Battery  fMRI 
dataset ( King et al., 2019 ), designed  to measure  a broad range of cogni- 
tive processes.  All experimental  protocols  were approved  in the orig- 
inal study by the Ethics committee  at Western  University  (Protocol  
#107,293),  including  informed  consent  provided  to all participants.  In 
brief, 24 healthy  subjects  (16 F; age: M = 23.8, SD = 2.6) each engaged  in 
47 diverse  task conditions  (e.g., ﬁnger tapping,  movie watching,  n-back,  
rest) across 32 ∼10-minute  scans. Each scan consisted  of a continuous  
task paradigm,  in which subjects  performed  a sequence  of 17 tasks (5 ‑sec 
instructions,  30 ‑sec task execution)  presented  in a random  order ﬁxed 
across subjects  (see Fig. 1 for tasks and their annotations).  Subjects  were 
scanned  on two task sets (A and B), and each task set had two scanning  
sessions  (with 8 scans per session).  16 subjects  were scanned  on set A 
in year 1 and set B in year 2, while the other 8 subjects  were scanned  
on set A in year 2 and set B 2–3 weeks later. The two task sets partially  
overlapped:  29 task conditions  in A and 32 task conditions  in B, with 14 
common  to both. While the original  paper considered  target and non- 
target trials of the Verbal 2-back and Object 2-back tasks as diﬀerent  
conditions  (resulting  in 4 total conditions),  the current  study viewed  
working  memory  load as constant  across the trial types and thus consid-  
ered each version  of the n-back task as a single condition  (resulting  in 
2 total conditions).  Moreover,  since contrasts  in the present  study were 
computed  relative  to the Rest condition,  all analyses  described  herein 
are based on 44 unique task conditions.  Finally,  one subject ( sub-29)  
was excluded  from analyses  due to failure of fMRI preprocessing.

2.1. Functionality  
Ironsmith  is a fully automated  QSM processing  pipeline  for creating  
QSM maps and extracting  QSM-based  iron concentrations  from anatom-  
ical ROIs, including  both subcortical  and cortical  brain regions  (89 GM 
ROIs included  with version  1.2; See Appendix  A ). Ironsmith  is open 
source, under the GNU general  public license (version  3), and was de- 
veloped  entirely  using Bash script . The latest version  of Ironsmith  can 
2  V. Zachariou,  C.E. Bauer, D.K. Powell et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118835 
be downloaded  from Github , together  with full documentation  and in- 
stallation  instructions.  Ironsmith  can perform  the following  tasks: 
1 Automate  the process  of creating  QSM maps from GRE DICOM  im- 
ages using MEDI Toolbox  ( De Rochefort  et al., 2010 ; J. Liu et al., 
2012 ; Liu et al., 2011a , 2011b ). 
2 Register  MPR or multi-echo  MPR (MEMPR)  T1 images to QSM maps 
and then segment  these into 89 ROIs ( Appendix  A ), using Freesurfer  
( Dale et al., 1999 ; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). 
3 Extract QSM-based  iron concentrations  from 89 ROIs, ﬁlter outlier 
voxels from ROIs (default:  larger than the 97th percentile  of QSM 
values),  and output the results into comma  separated  variable  (CSV) 
tables. 
4 Calculate  SNR (GRE magnitude  image based) for each ROI as a mea- 
sure of quality control for QSM data and output SNR values in CSV 
tables. 
5 Identify  outlier regions  on phase images using a median  absolute  
deviation  (MAD) based outlier detection  process.  Calculate  the per- 
cent overlap  between  phase-image  outlier regions  and each of the 
89 supported  ROIs. Output the results into CSV tables. 
6 Non-linearly  warp QSM maps and aligned  MPR/MEMPR  to MNI152  
1mm space. This step allows users to (1) extract QSM values from 
standard  space ROIs not included  with Ironsmith  and (2) conduct  
voxelwise  analyses  (these options  are not used/described  in the 
present  manuscript,  which focuses  on extraction  of QSM values from 
native participant  space). 
7 Process  single or multiple  participants  in parallel  (multiple  instances

2.1. Participants  
Sixteen  female volunteers  (ages 20–30, mean age 24.3 years) par- 
ticipated  in the fMRI experiment.  All participants  were right-handed,  
healthy  with normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and gave written  in- 
formed  consent.  The studies were run in accordance  with the guidelines  
of the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and Research  Ethics Committee  of Aalto 
University  approved  the study protocol.  
2.2. Stimuli 
The stimuli were 35 one-minute-long  narratives  representing  six 
emotional  states (anger, fear, disgust,  happiness,  sadness,  surprise)  and a 
neutral  state (ﬁve narratives  per category  in Finnish,  transcribed  English  
translations  of the stimuli are available  in Supplementary  Table S4). The 
narratives  described  personal  life events spoken by a female speaker  
with natural  emotional  prosody  and included  emotional  expressions,  
such as weeping  and laughing,  and have been shown to elicit strong 
aﬀect in listeners  ( Smirnov  et al., 2019 ). Prior to the audio recording  of 
the spoken narratives,  the speakers  were given the target emotion  cate- 
gories as well as ﬁve narrative  topics per category  and were instructed  
to develop  and rehearse  1-minute-long  narratives  that described  a cor- 
responding  autobiographical  experience  that elicited  an instance  of the

four females  (ages 20–37, mean age = 24.4 years) rated the stories for 
the experienced,  categorical  emotional  content  (Supplementary  Fig. S1; 
Supplementary  Table S1). Behavioral  ratings conﬁrmed  that the sto- 
ries successfully  elicited  the a priori deﬁned  target emotion;  however,  
to strengthen  the eﬀect in the fMRI experiment,  the participants  also 
saw a word corresponding  the target emotion  prior to each story and 
a short description  of the narrative  gist ( Fig. 1 a). To ensure that the 
stimuli successfully  elicited  emotions  during the scanning,  the fMRI par- 
ticipants  also rated the valence  and arousal  elicited  by the stories (see 
below).  However,  as they were presented  with the target emotion  cate- 
gory during the fMRI scanning,  we did not collect ratings for the emotion  
categories.

tifacts during scanning  by updating  the pulse sequence  using motion 
tracking  devices,  such as navigators  or sensors.  In opposite,  the ret- 
rospective  approach  estimates  the motion parameters  after completing  
the scanning  (i.e., during image reconstruction)  using prior informa-  
tion derived  from external  sensors  or applying  iterative  or autofocus-  
ing algorithms.  However,  such approaches  require  additional  hardware  
and time, which imply a concern  of calibrations  with the MRI scanner  
and intensive  computations  to estimate  motion parameters,  respectively  
( Godenschweger  et al., 2016 ). Therefore,  automated  correction  of MRI 
motion artifacts  without  the need of external  navigators  is of great clin- 
ical signiﬁcance  and has become  an active research  area. 
Recently,  the advances  of deep learning  convolutional  neural net- 
works (CNNs)  are gaining  a lot of attention  and have been widely uti- 
lized in the ﬁeld of medical  image analysis,  speciﬁcally  the MRI domain.  
For instance,  the CNNs have been succeeded  in developing  several clin- 
ical MRI applications,  including  reconstruction  of images ( Hyun et al., 
2018 ; Ryu et al., 2019 ; Schlemper  et al., 2018 ; Aggarwal  et al., 2019 ) 
and correction  of artifacts  ( Terpstra  et al., 2020 ; Chatterjee  et al., 2020 ; 
Haskell  et al., 2019 ; Ko et al., 2021 ; Lee et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2020 ; 
Oh et al., 2021 ; Oksuz et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 
2020 ; Shaw et al., 2020 ). The last few years have witnessed  numer-  
ous attempts  to solving  the task of motion artifacts  correction  using the 
deep learning  paradigm.  ( Meding  et al., 2017 ) introduced  a fully au- 
tomated  data-driven  CNN approach  to determine  whether  the recorded  
MR image is aﬀected  by motion artifacts  during image acquisition.  They 
utilized  a binary classiﬁcation  model to detect ‘motion’  and ‘no motion’  
categories  within intra-scan  motion rather than inter-scan.  The works 
in Oksuz et al. (2019) , Zhang et al. (2020) proposed  automatic  multi- 
stream CNNs to detect the presence  of motion artifacts  in cardiac  MR 
images.  A curriculum  learning,  a part of active learning,  was employed  
to eﬃciently  determine  the level of motion severity  by training  a deep 
learning  network  with samples  of gradually  increasing  the diﬃculty  
(i.e., from good to poor image quality)  ( Oksuz et al., 2019 ). The atten- 
tion supervision  was used in Zhang et al. (2020) to guide the network  
to focus on the target region. This particular  attention  was achieved  
by computing  the importance  weights  of the gradients  with respect to 
the activation  maps. Also, Ko et al. presented  the signiﬁcance  of us- 
ing a self-spatial  attention  module  within the deep residual  network  for 
rigid and non-rigid  motion artifacts  reduction  in computed  tomography  
images ( Ko et al., 2021 ). Kustner  et al. (2019) compared  two image- 
to-image  translation  methods,  Generative  Adversarial  Network(GAN)  
and Variational  Auto Encoder  (VAE), for retrospective  correction  of 
rigid and non-rigid  motion artifacts.  The results presented  that the GAN 
method  has better feasibility  to produce  near-realistic  motion-free  im- 
ages. For 3D rigid-body  motion correction  in brain MRI, Johnson  and 
Drangova  (2019) developed  a 3D version  of a 2D pixel2pixel  network  
based on conditional  GAN (cGAN).  The 3D cGAN’s  generator  was com- 
posed of 3D U-Net, and its discriminator  contained  six 3D CNN lay- 
ers. Their method  resulted  in a qualitative  image improvement  for mo- 
tion ‐corrupted  test ‐set volumes.  An investigation  of the applicability  
of 3D CNNs methods  for retrospective  motion artifact  correction  was 
presented  in Duﬀy et al. (2018) . Both High-resolution  3D Network  
(HR3DNet)  and HR3DNetGAN  successfully  diminished  the severity  of 
artifacts  compared  to the conventional  Gaussian  smoothing  method.  As 
an extension  to this work, the same research  group demonstrated  the 
possibility  of 3D CNNs to improve  cortical  surface reconstruction  and 
their ability to better identify  brain morphological  changes  in subjects  
with Parkinson’s  disease  ( Duﬀy et al., 2021 ). In Haskell  et al. (2019) de- 
veloped  a separable  motion correction  model called Network  Acceler-  
ated Motion  Estimation  and Reduction  (NAMER)  ( Haskell  et al., 2019 ), 
which integrated  a deep learning  motion artifacts  detection  with a mo- 
tion estimation  model. Although  the NAMER  has achieved  promising  
motion mitigation,  it required  a long processing  time of around 7.13 
min for a single slice. Hence, the need for an end-to-end  method  with 
less execution  time is still demanded.  Similar  to the NAMER,  Wang 
et al. utilized  the CNN prediction  as an initial guess (i.e., data ﬁdelity)  into the optimization  problem  to correct the out-of-ﬁeld  of view motion 
( Wang et al., 2020 ). Their results show that the combined  motion model- 
based data ﬁdelity  outperformed  the CNN prediction  for the 2D motion 
correction.  However,  in the case of 3D motion correction,  better image 
quality was obtained  using the CNN prediction  compared  to the data ﬁ- 
delity model. In Liu et al. (2020) , the authors  developed  a deep residual  
U-Net with densely  connected  multi-resolution  blocks (DRN-DCMB)  to 
correct the motion artifacts  in MR images.  The proposed  network  was 
designed  to learn the motion artifacts,  where a single shortcut  connec-  
tion that connected  the corrupted  input with the residual  map prediction  
could reproduce  the output with reduced  motion artifacts.  The perfor- 
mance of motion artifacts  reduction  was improved  from 0.867 (the in- 
put simulated  motion)  to 0.965 in term of the Structural  Similarity  index 
(SSIM).  Compared  to the original  U-Net, their network  achieved  a slight 
improvement  rate of 0.8% in term of SSIM. 
Diﬀerent  from the above studies,  Lee et al. (2021) , 
Chatterjee  et al. (2020) attempted  to solve the motion problem  
by the inclusion  of multi-contrast  images.  Lee et al. built a framework  
consisting  of two parts: multi-contrast  image registration  and motion 
correction  networks  for three MRI sequences,  namely  T 1 -weighted  
(T 1 w), T 2 -weighted  (T 2 w), and Fluid-Attenuated  Inversion  Recovery  
(FLAIR)  ( Lee et al., 2021 ). After the multi-contrast  image alignment  
has been performed,  the encoder  of the motion correction  network  
separately  extracted  feature vectors  for each contrast  image. Then, 
all these features  were combined  to share information  from diﬀerent  
contrasts.  In the end, the decoder  path was able to learn these features  
and generate  multi-output  corrected  predictions.  Even though this work 
presented  diﬀerent  scenarios  of using input images with motion-free  or 
motion-corrupted,  it seems that the authors  did not intend to exploit 
multi-contrast  as priors as clearly mentioned  in Chatterjee  et al. (2020) . 
The best motion correction  scenario  for any corrupted  target was 
through  feeding  the rest pure contrast  images without  any motion.  
More speciﬁcally,  for better motion artifact  reduction  in T 1 w, it was 
recommended  to pass the motion-free  T 2 w and FLAIR images into the 
network  along with the corrupted  T 1 w image. Chatterjee  et al. intro- 
duced a retrospective  deep learning  network  to remove  motion artifacts  
with the assistance  of additional  information  presented  as image priors 
( Chatterjee  et al., 2020 ). Supplying  additional  prior knowledge  was 
performed  using two diﬀerent  types of image priors: similar slices of 
the image contrast  from other subjects  and diﬀerent  contrasts  of the 
same subjects.  The second prior type is similar to the work presented  
in Lee et al. (2021) , but it used diﬀerent  image contrasts,  including  
T 1 w, T 2 w, and Proton Density  (PD) images.  During the correction  
process  of the corrupted  T 2 w image, they utilized  the motion-free  T 1 w 
and PD images as priors. Their ﬁndings  concluded  that the correction  
performance  was not improved  when the priors of similar contrasts  
but diﬀerent  subjects  were utilized.  In contrast,  promising  results were 
obtained  in the case of using priors of diﬀerent  contrasts  but of the 
same subjects.  
Since it is challenging  to acquire  pairs of motion-corrupted  images 
and ground-truth  clean images,  most research  in the ﬁeld of motion 
artifact  correction  trained  and tested their methods  using synthesized  
corrupted  images from motion-free  data. The motion artifact  simulation  
could be achieved  by applying  some rotation  and translation  transfor-  
mations  in the spatial domain  or by adding phase shift to the k-space  
in the frequency  domain.  The amount  of motion could be controlled  
to derive various  levels of motion severity.  For example,  the average  
SSIM for the corrupted  motion data was between  40% and 74% in 
Wang et al. (2020) , 86.70%  in Liu et al. (2020) , and around 77.0% 
in Chatterjee  et al. (2020) . However,  the corrupted  input images in 
Lee et al. (2021) seem to be not severe since the average  SSIM scores of 
98.11%,  91.25%,  and 92.79%  were reported  for T1w, T2w, and FLAIR, 
respectively.  
It is observed  that most of the aforementioned  works endeavored  to 
reduce the MRI motion artifacts  through  developing  new deep learning  
architectures.  However,  the task of motion correction  is quite diﬀerent  
2  M.A. Al-masni,  S. Lee, J. Yi et al. NeuroImage  259 (2022) 119411 
from other tasks such as segmentation  and detection.  It is of note that 
deep learning  networks  in segmentation  and detection  tasks usually  try 
to learn some representative  features  from input data that reﬂect the tar- 
get Region of Interest  (ROI) (i.e., target ROI is visible to the network).  
Diﬀerently,  deep learning  motion correction  networks  struggle  to ﬁnd or 
correct missing  structural  details from the distorted  images.  Only a few 
works ( Lee et al., 2021 , Chatterjee  et al., 2020 ) have utilized  additional  
prior knowledge  from diﬀerent  image contrasts  of the same subjects.  
Nevertheless,  these works required  additional  MRI scans, which could 
not be available  in all routine  clinical  exams and does not seem to be 
feasible  for future medical  practices.  Therefore,  suﬃcient  room exists 
for improving  the feasibility  and eﬀectivity  of the motion artifacts  cor- 
rection.  
In this paper, we address  the above-mentioned  issues by designing  
eﬃcient  2D stacked  U-Nets with self-assisted  priors to solve the prob- 
lem of motion artifacts  in 3D brain MRI. The proposed  work aims to 
exploit the usage of additional  knowledge  priors from the corrupted  im- 
ages themselves  without  the need for additional  contrast  data. Since the 
brain structure  is homogenous  among the relatively  neighboring  regions  
(i.e., has high correlations  in successive  slices), it seems possible  to trans- 
fer these anatomical  details from the adjacent  slices that might have less 
motion corruption.  Eventually,  each speciﬁed  motion-corrupted  image 
can be corrected  signiﬁcantly  via enabling  the proposed  stacked  net- 
works to learn extra knowledge  information  using the self-assisted  pri- 
ors (i.e., from contiguous  slices). More speciﬁcally,  the proposed  net- 
work initiates  by concatenating  multi-inputs  (i.e., the corrupted  image 
and its adjacent  slices) and eventually  yields a single corrected  image. 
In this case, the network  could reveal some missed structural  details 
throughout  the assistance  of the information  that exists in the adjacent  
slices, especially  in the case of 3D imaging  (as the case of this work). 
Recent retrospective  deep learning  studies included  multi-contrast  im- 
ages or similar slices as image priors for better motion correction  perfor- 
mances.  In contrast,  this work aims to develop  a reliable  motion correc- 
tion method  without  multi-contrast  MR images that require  additional  
scans and high computational  costs. Alternatively,  we include  the con- 
tiguous  slices in 3D MR images with high spatial similarities  as image 
priors into the proposed  network  to ﬁll in missing  structures.  The ad- 
jacent slices might be utilized  as a useful contextual  information  fusion 
strategy  in some medical  image analysis  applications.  However,  to the 
best of our knowledge,  this is the ﬁrst time to employ  the idea of self- 
assisted  priors to address  the problem  of motion artifacts  correction.  
Furthermore,  we develop  stacked  U-Nets that enable to re-evaluate  the 
initial estimates  by capturing  some spatial relationships  between  pre- 
dictions.  Here, the prediction  reuse with spatial attention  preserves  the 
spatial location  and leads to better reﬁnement  of the corrected  images.  
Finally,  our proposed  stacked  U-Nets with the inclusion  of self-assisted  
priors and spatial attention  result in better performance  of the MRI mo- 
tion artifact  correction.  
Even though 3D motion correction  methods  can inherently  leverage  
context  information  on 3D MRI data, they require  high computational  
complexity  (i.e., computationally  expensive).  Additionally,  the more ex- 
tensive training  parameters  of 3D methods  compared  to 2D networks  
may require  larger training  samples.  In contrast,  our proposed  2D mo- 
tion correction  approach  is quite similar to 3D techniques  since it can 
share the context  from the adjacent  slices with much fewer computa-  
tions. 
The main contributions  of this paper are outlined  as follows.  
(1) We propose  a novel motion artifact  correction  method  that learns 
additional  knowledge  priors from the adjacent  slices of the same cor- 
rupted subject.  The main idea of the self-assisted  priors is to capture  
some missed structural  information  from image priors and enable 
the network  to learn these unreachable  patterns  to achieve  more ac- 
curate correction  of motion artifacts.  
(2) With the inclusion  of self-assisted  priors and spatial attention,  we de- 
velop end-to-end  2D stacked  reﬁnement  networks.  This can further improve  the pixel-to-pixel  dependency  through  pixel-wise  matching  
and spatial location  preservation  between  predictions.  
(3) We provide  an intensive  analysis  of using diﬀerent  types of image 
priors: the proposed  self-assisted  priors and priors from other image 
contrast  of the same subject.  This analysis  proves the eﬀectiveness  
and feasibility  of our self-assisted  priors since it does not require  any 
further data scans.

The rest of this article is organized  as follows.  Section  2 presents  
the motion artifacts  simulation  and provides  theory and details of the 
proposed  stacked  networks.  Section  3 demonstrates  the ablation  analysis  
of using diﬀerent  types of priors and presents  all experimental  results of 
both the simulated  and in-vivo data. Eventually,  Sections  4 and 5 discuss 
and conclude  the paper, respectively.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Original  dataset 
To accomplish  the motion artifact  correction  task, we have collected  
a set of clinical  brain MRI data at Seoul National  University  Hospi- 
tal (SNUH).  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all partici-  
pants and the study was approved  by the Institutional  Review  Board 
of SNUH. Our dataset contains  83 motion-free  clinical  subjects,  which 
was utilized  to generate  the simulated  motion data to conduct  network  
training.  Additionally,  separate  24 clinical  subjects  with motion dis- 
torted were acquired  to perform  the in-vivo assessment.  These real clin- 
ical subjects  were not instructed  to induce motion during data acquisi-  
tion. 3D T1-weighted  gradient  echoes,  called BRAin VOlume  (BRAVO),  
were acquired  on a",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5372, 5375), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(16809, 16812), match=' 3.'>"

Clewett  et al., 2018 ), a common  proxy for LC-catecholamine  activ- 
ity ( Joshi et al., 2016 ). Human  pupilimetry  studies have implicated  
the LC-catecholamine  system in trait neuroticism  ( Unsworth  and Ro- 
bison, 2017 ), and genetic  studies have linked inferred  reductions  in cat- 
echolamine  synthesis  capacity  with higher neuroticism  ( Tochigi  et al., 
2006 ). 
The LC is one of the earliest  regions  to accumulate  AD-related  tau 
pathology  ( Braak et al., 2011 ), and may initiate  the spread of tau 
pathology  to connected  regions  ( Iba et al., 2015 ; Jacobs et al., 2021 ). 
Our previous  research  established  relationships  between  higher tempo- 
ral lobe tau pathology  measured  with [ 18 F]Flortaucipir  (FTP) PET and 
lower LC-catecholamine  synthesis  capacity  measured  with [ 18 F]Fluoro-  
m-tyrosine  (FMT; Ciampa  et al., 2022 ). FMT, a substrate  for aromatic  
amino acid decarboxylase,  is an irreversible  PET tracer sensitive  to cate- 
cholamine  (norepinephrine  and dopamine)  and monoamine  (serotonin)  
synthesis.  Our previous  research  found that LC catecholamine  synthesis  
capacity  predicted  temporal  lobe tau-PET  signal, but we did not ﬁnd as- 
sociations  between  tau and either raphe serotonin  synthesis  capacity  or 
dopamine  synthesis  capacity  in the midbrain  or striatum  ( Ciampa  et al., 
2022 ). 
While the LC is considered  an important  biomarker  for the early 
detection  of AD processes  ( Betts et al., 2019 ; Matchett  et al., 2021 ), 
there is a paucity  of integrative  research  considering  the ways in which 
the aﬀective  functions  of the LC-catecholamine  system may impact AD 
vulnerability  (though  see Omoluabi  et al., 2021 ). It is possible  that 
the chronic  engagement  of stress pathways  in high-neuroticism  indi- 
viduals  ( Kruschwitz  et al., 2015 ), including  LC-amygdala  interactions  
( Giustino  et al., 2020 ), increases  one’s vulnerability  to the accumula-  
tion of tau pathology.  There is substantial  tau pathology  in the amyg- 
dala, even in cognitively  normal  older adults ( Abiose et al., 2020 ). How 
elevated  amygdala  tau is associated  with aﬀective  processes  and lifestyle  
factors is an area of active research  ( Abiose et al., 2020 ), though pre- 
vious work in aging has demonstrated  higher amygdala  tau pathology  
in individuals  with higher trait neuroticism  ( Schultz  et al., 2020 ). A re- 
cent meta-analysis  examining  relationships  between  personality  traits and AD-related  pathology  identiﬁed  higher neuroticism  as the primary  
personality  trait associated  with higher pathology,  with lower conscien-  
tiousness  as secondary  (see Terracciano  et al. (2022) for a recent meta- 
analysis).  
This study in cognitively  normal  older adults aimed to establish  re- 
lationships  between  the LC-catecholamine  system,  neuroticism,  and the 
development  of AD-related  tau pathology  in the amygdala.  Though  our 
hypotheses  centered  on neuroticism  given its clear link with stress and 
aﬀective  processes,  exploratory  analyses  probed LC catecholamines’  as- 
sociations  with trait conscientiousness,  agreeableness,  openness,  and ex- 
traversion.

1. Introduction  
Spatial coordinates  are a fundamental  framework  for understanding  
the brain through  mapping  cells, architectures  and functions.  Stereotac-  
tic devices  are widely used in animal neuroscience  and oﬀer a coordinate  
to map and target speciﬁc  brain regions  ( Hardman  and Ashwell,  2012 ; 
Palazzi and Bordier,  2009 ; Paxinos  et al., 2012 ; Stephan  et al., 1980 ; 
Yuasa et al., 2010 ). Atlases in stereotactic  coordinates  are commonly  
based on a single subject’s  ex-vivo  brain histology  data ( Bowden  and 
Martin,  2000 ; Hardman  and Ashwell,  2012 ; Paxinos  and Franklin,  2019 ; 
Paxinos  and Watson,  2017 ; Saleem  and Logothetis,  2006 ). The as- 
sumption  behind the stereotactic  approach  is that each brain structure  
has consistent  coordinates  across individuals  relative  to cranial land- 
marks (e.g., the bregma,  the interaural  line, the infra-orbital  ridges) 
( Horsley  and Clarke, 1908 ). While this assumption  may hold true in ro- 
dents that have low intersubject  variability  of brain structure  and func- 
tion, it remains  unclear  in increasingly  used small primates  such as the 
New World monkey,  common  marmoset  ( Callithrix  jacchus ). For exam- 
ple, the brain volume  of marmosets  is likely more variable  than inbred 
laboratory  strains of rodents:  the coeﬃcient  of variation  (COV) of brain 
volume  is 2.3% in mice ( Ma et al., 2008 ),",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(4881, 4884), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(2502, 2505), match=' 3.'>"

developmental  datasets  ( Alexander  et al., 2017 ; Satterthwaite  et al., 
2016 ), the Healthy  Brain Network  (HBN) and the Philadelphia  Neurode-  
velopmental  Cohort (PNC). 
First, we performed  cluster-based  inference  on our primary  dataset,  
the HBN, establishing  robust patterns  of connectivity  diﬀerences  in the 
motor, somatosensory,  and language  networks.  We then estimated  the 
generalizability  of these results to the PNC. Given the consistency  of 
results and to increase  power for whole-brain  analyses,  we combined  
these datasets  to examine  diﬀerences  across the connectome  and per- 
form exploratory  investigations  of diﬀerences  for cerebellar  edges. Over- 
all, these results demonstrate  that wide-spread  diﬀerences  in functional  
organization,  spanning  the whole-brain,  exist between  left- and right- 
handed  individuals.  Thus, it may be important  to account  for handed-  
ness in functional  connectivity  studies,  in particular  for studies involv- 
ing neuropsychiatric  disorders,  where left-handed  individuals  are dis- 
proportionately  represented  ( Hirnstein  and Hugdahl,  2014 ). 
2. Methods  
2.1. Overview  
We begin by using a primary  dataset,  the Healthy  Brain Network  
(HBN), to explore  diﬀerences  between  left- and right-handed  individu-  
als within networks  of interest  using functional  connectivity  to acknowl-  
edge previous  literature  and show these results in the context  of func- 
tional connectivity.  We then show that diﬀerences  between  left- and 
right-handed  individuals  within our primary  dataset generalizes  to other 
datasets,  such as the Philadelphia  Neurodevelopmental  Cohort (PNC). 
After combining  these datasets  to maximize  statistical  power, we subse- 
quently  explore  diﬀerences  in handedness  using functional  connectivity  
across the whole brain. Our secondary  analyses  on the cerebellum  are 
subsequently  derived  from interesting  patterns  and results that emerge  
from the whole brain analyses.  
2.2. Primary  dataset:  Healthy  Brain Network  (HBN) 
For the primary  analyses,  connectomes  were generated  from 
resting-state  scans obtained  from the Healthy  Brain Network  (HBN) 
( Alexander  et al., 2017 ). All resting-state  scans are 10 minutes  long us- 
ing Siemens  Scanners  at four diﬀerent  sites around the New York greater 
metropolitan  area: Staten Island, Cornell  University,  City University  of 
New York, and Rutgers  University.  After excluding  subjects  for miss- 
ing scans/data  and excessive  motion ( > 0.25 mm), 817 subjects  remain 
(right-handed  individuals:  713, left-handed  individuals:  104). Subjects’  
ages ranged from 5 to 22 (Fig. S1), where 148 subjects  had no diagnosis  
and 669 had some diagnosis  of learning  disorders  or symptoms  of psy- 
chiatry.  Edinburgh  Handedness  Questionnaire  (EHQ) scores were used 
as a measure  of the extent subjects  were left- or right-handed.  Scores 
ranged from − 100 to 100 where − 100 is considered  an extremely  left- 
handed  individual  and 100 is considered  an extremely  right-handed  in- 
dividual,  (histogram:  Fig. S2).

the bonding  level between  subjects  is reﬂected  in peak synchronization  
( Kinreich  et al., 2017 ; Pan et al., 2017 ), and mother-infant  empathy  and 
learning  are associated  with neural synchrony  during their interactions  
( Levy et al., 2017 ; Reindl et al., 2018 ). This kind of synchronization  
is thought  to be a key aspect of therapeutic  alliances  (e.g., Koole and 
Tschacher,  2016 ; Kupper  et al., 2016 ), and interestingly,  within-group  
structure  as well as between-group  conﬂict  relate to synchronization  be- 
tween members  ( Jiang et al., 2015 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). A few studies have 
demonstrated  clinical  value of brain synchronization  in the form of a 
neural synchronization  deﬁcit in social interaction  disorders,  i.e. Border-  
line Personality  Disorder  ( Bilek et al., 2017 ) and Autism ( Tanabe  et al., 
2012 ). In line with this, interaction-based  phenotyping  of psychiatric  pa- 
tients might be particularly  useful for understanding  the (social)  brain 
and its disorders,  as well as in the development  of personalized  treat- 
ments ( Leong and Schilbach,  2019 ; Schilbach,  2016 ). 
In summary,  these studies suggest  that neural synchronization  be- 
tween brains is a fundamental  function  of the human brain that is re- 
lated to key characteristics  of social interaction  and its success.  This 
makes neural coupling  a promising  new target for both the mechanistic  
understanding  of interpersonal  exchange,  and the development  of novel 
interventions  to support  social functioning.  
1.2. Correlation  and causality  
Inter-brain  associations  are often measured  in terms of statistical  de- 
pendencies  among two or more fMRI timeseries.  Common  examples  in 
the time domain  include  (cross-)  covariance  and (cross-)  correlation;  
their counterparts  in the frequency  domain  are the cross-spectral  density  
and coherence,  respectively  (see Fig. 1 of Friston et al., 2014b ). Moving  
beyond  instantaneous  associations  among timeseries,  (non-parametric)  
Granger  causality  describes  temporal  precedence  among pairs of time- 
series, an approach  that has been successfully  applied  in the study of 
inter-brain  associations  ( Schippers  et al., 2010 ). These multi-variate  data 
features  or descriptive  statistics  are static transforms  of the data, and the 
analysis  of which is typically  referred  to as functional  connectivity  in the 
neuroimaging  literature  (or directed  functional  connectivity  in the case of 
Granger  causality).  However,  such measures  do not explain  how puta- 
tive generalized  synchrony  between  brains is caused.  Correlations  are a 
descriptive  feature of the data, not the mechanism  generating  the data. 
On the contrary,  in the study of social interaction  and related disor- 
ders, we are concerned  with the causal eﬀect one brain may have on 
another.  It is important  to understand  whether  brain states are shared 
between  interacting  individuals,  the direction  of how these eﬀects are 
shared (e.g., which direction  of eﬀects is relevant  at a particular  point 
in time, or during a speciﬁc  joint action; thus inferring  causality  within 
a network),  when they are shared (e.g., when we cooperate  vs. when 
we do something  separately  but at the same time/place),  and how they 
are aﬀected  by individual  and interaction-related  factors (e.g., similar-  
ity between  partners,  individual  personality  traits, interaction  styles). 
This aids a mechanistic  understanding  of social interaction  on the brain 
level, and the development  of interventions  to facilitate  neural coupling;  
for example,  between  patients  and clinicians  in psychotherapy,  where 
optimal  neural synchrony  may relate to mutual understanding  and ther- 
apeutic  alliance  building.  
Furthermore,  correlations  between  simultaneously  acquired  data are 
interpreted  as information  ﬂow or the emergence  of shared brain states 
( Redcay  and Schilbach,  2019 ). However,  this interpretation  is challeng-  
ing: all correlative  measures  of synchronization  between  brains can be 
partly induced  by a shared sensorium.  In other words, when subjects  ex- 
perience  similar sensory  inputs, the evoked  and induced  responses  will 
be correlated  to a greater or lesser degree.  This is the same problem  that 
faces characterizations  of functional  connectivity  between  regions  within 
the same brain. Researchers  have tried to remove  the correlations  be- 
tween sensory  bound brain responses  that confound  tests for (and inter- 
pretations  of) synchronization  of a nontrivial  kind, for example  through  
permutation  approaches  or task control conditions  ( Bilek et al., 2015 ; Koike et al., 2019 ) (for a review on fMRI hyperscanning  analysis  meth- 
ods see Czeszumski  et al., 2020 ). However,  this procedure  does not in- 
form whether  a connection  between  brain systems  may be assumed.  We 
have to test empirically  whether  neural coupling  between  brains pro- 
vides a ‘better’ explanation  for the neuroimaging  data than single-brain  
networks  (i.e., whether  between-brain  models yield a more accurate  pre- 
diction of the data and we ﬁnd higher evidence  for such models than 
for single-brain  models).  In this context,  the best explanation  or model 
is the one that maximizes  the probability  of observing  the data given 
the model – i.e., the model evidence.  This can always be decomposed  
into the accuracy  of the model minus its complexity.  For example,  we 
can expect the activity  of individuals  watching  the same movie to corre- 
late, because  the identical  data is processed  in two brains. Single brain 
networks  will be most eﬃcient  in explaining  the correlated  neuroimag-  
ing time-series,  because  they are the least complex  networks  that pro- 
vide the most accurate  prediction  of data. For social interaction,  we 
ﬁnd correlations  between  time-series  that may not be fully accounted  
for through  shared perceptual  input ( Redcay  and Schilbach,  2019 ). We 
wish to quantify  this speciﬁc  eﬀect, and we wish to infer the eﬀective  
connectivity  of our network.  
In this paper, we address  these issues using measures  of eﬀective  
connectivity  and Bayesian  model comparison  in the setting of dynamic  
causal modeling  (DCM).  DCM can be used to distinguish  potential  causes 
of correlations,  while and quantifying  the evidence  for competing  hy- 
potheses  about the network  architectures  generating  these correlations.  
Both, shared sensory  input and eﬀective  connectivity  between  brains 
could result in correlated  time-series.  To disambiguate  between  synchro-  
nization  and shared input as potential  causes of correlation,  the models 
considered  here include  both so that they directly  compete  in explain-  
ing variance.  Speciﬁcally,  a large number  of diﬀerent  parameter  combi- 
nations  are examined  and compared  in their accuracy  of predicting  the 
data. This allows one to compare  the evidence  for models with and with- 
out eﬀective  coupling  between  brains, in the context  of the shared in- 
put. We thus use model evidence  to determine  which network  structure  
is optimal  in predicting  the data. Correlated  neuronal  responses  become  
the data features  that have to be explained  by models with and with- 
out between-brain  (eﬀective)  connections.  However,  our main interest  
lies in the examination  of the winning  model. After model estimation,  
DCM provides  parameters  that quantify  the causal and directed  eﬀect 
one brain region exerts over another.  This kind of modeling  thus oﬀers 
a causal explanation  of how the observed  data were generated,  and how 
the brain systems  exchange  states during social contact.  
From previous  hyperscanning  work we hypothezise  that a model that 
includes  connections  between  the brains of interacting  individuals  will 
perform  better in explaining  the data than models that do not include  
between-brain  connections.

mensionality  reduction  methods  such as singular  value decomposition  
(SVD) ( Leonardi  et al., 2013 ), k-means  clustering  ( Allen et al., 2014 ), 
or hierarchical  clustering  ( Yang et al., 2014 ), can be applied  to extract 
the most relevant  brain patterns.  The timescale  of these dynamically-  
occurring  FC patterns  is limited by the temporal  window  length, and 
their spatial speciﬁcity  by the nature of FC that characterizes  interact-  
ing activity  between  brain regions.  For this reason,  Bayesian  and prob- 
abilistic  methods  represent  good examples  of extracting  repeating  ac- 
tivity patterns  from whole-brain  data ( Smith et al., 2011; Varoquaux  
et al., 2010; Vidaurre  et al., 2017 ). In neuroimaging,  these approaches  
have been explored  with the aim of applying  unsupervised  learning  to 
estimate  diﬀerent  hidden temporal  states; e.g., Hidden  Markov  Models  
(HMM)  ( Eavani et al., 2013 ) to perform  an activation  network  analy- 
sis ( Taghia et al., 2018; Vidaurre  et al., 2018a; 2018b; 2019; 2016 ). 
While dynamic  FC patterns  are generated  by looking  at ﬂuctuations  
in second-order  statistics  (i.e., correlation),  alternatively,  instantaneous  
activity-based  brain states can access shorter timescales  and directly  ex- 
plain the empirical  BOLD time courses.  
In this work, we propose  a new framework  to estimate  multiple  
functional  states, using a recently  introduced  Bayesian-based  generative  
model that is the Graph Laplacian  Mixture  Model (GLMM),  suitable  for 
mixed signals expressed  on diﬀerent  graphs ( Maretic  et al., 2018; Petric 
Maretic  and Frossard,  2020 ). Several  graph learning  techniques  ( Dong 
et al., 2019; Mateos  et al., 2019 ) have been recently  proposed  in order 
to infer a meaningful  graph structure  from data. Due to the instanta-  
neous nature of these methods,  the choice of crucial parameters  such as 
window  lengths  ( Leonardi  and Van De Ville, 2015 ) is eliminated.  
General  approaches  for learning  graphs to represent  data structure  
started with Dong et al. (2016) who focuses  on graph Laplacian  ma- 
trix inference,  which enforces  data smoothness  on the inferred  graph 
( Kalofolias,  2016 ). Using a more eﬃcient  solution,  dictionary-based  
methods  assume  that signals can be modeled  as a sparse combina-  
tion of localised  graph dictionary  atoms ( Petric Maretic  et al., 2017; 
Thanou  et al., 2017 ). Multiple  graph inference  methods  include  works 
on time-varying  graphs ( Kalofolias  et al., 2017; Yamada  et al., 2019 ), 
where temporal  signals reﬂect the structure  of several graphs,  each 
of which is active in a pre-deﬁned  time period. The recent work of 
Gan et al. (2019) imposes  that the sparsity  pattern  on all inferred  graphs 
should be similar through  a Bayesian  prior. All of these works focus ei- 
ther on inferring  only one graph or already  have a predeﬁned  set of sig- 
nals for each graph that needs to be inferred.  Such a strong assumption  is 
not realistic  in RS fMRI data, where a wide array of dynamic  functional  
networks  are known to occur. By appealing  to GLMM ( Petric Maretic  
and Frossard,  2020 ), we simultaneously  learn multiple  graph structures  
(represented  by graph Laplacian  matrices)  and, separately,  nodal activa- 
tion patterns.  Additionally,  along with these two elements,  brain signals 
are decomposed  into clusters  with a certain probability.  These three el- 
ements form together  what we call here state . 
Interestingly,  when we validate  this approach  with task fMRI data, 
we observe  the probabilities  reﬂecting  the dynamic  of epochs of the 
experimental  paradigms,  even though these are completely  unknown  to 
the method  –which  is anyway  the case for RS fMRI data. Diﬀerent  from 
other HMM frameworks,  we have neither  a Markovian  assumption  nor 
any constraint  on the temporal  axis. By being more ﬂexible,  we still are 
able to capture  a meaningful  dynamic.  
We also show that the extracted  states consist of brain areas that 
are consistent  with previously  observed  regions  implicated  in the corre- 
sponding  task. We then apply the GLMM to RS data and obtain the most 
prevalent  states governing  spontaneously  interacting  brain areas. 
Overall,  this approach  allows us to revisit the relationship  between  
brain function  and underlying  structure,  which is one of the fundamen-  
tal questions  in neuroscience  ( Atasoy et al., 2016; Betzel et al., 2016; 
Goni et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015; Hutchison  et al., 2013; Preti and Van 
De Ville, 2019; Tarun et al., 2020 ). The traditional  approaches  to es- 
timate structural  connectivity  from FC, do not account  for ﬂuctuations  
of brain activity  and thus how the structure-function  link is exploited  diﬀerently  over time. Therefore,  here we show that the estimated  graph 
Laplacian  matrices  reveal indicative  similarities  with SC. Moreover,  we 
observe  that the most notable  brain pattern  that consistently  is part of 
states in all tasks, as well as in RS, is the default mode network  (DMN).  
Diﬀerent  studies have tried to capture  how the DMN diﬀers in diﬀerent  
neurological  conditions  ( Nair et al., 2020 ; Ren et al., 2020 ; Shine et al., 
2015; Starck et al., 2013 ). That is why we ﬁnally focus our attention  to 
the similarities  and diﬀerences  of the DMN patterns  estimated  during 
the rest epochs across all task paradigms  and during resting state. The 
question  consequently  arises as to how the diﬀerences  in connectivity  
structure  that give rise to various  DMN graphs are related to the brain’s 
underlying  anatomical  structure.  
Finally,  we leverage  on a dissimilarity  score to index the level of cog- 
nitive association:  the more dissimilar  the score is, the more it indicates  
that that network  belongs  to a higher cognitive  level task, suggesting  
an appropriate  method  of comparison  with respect to classical  Pearson  
correlations.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Data and preprocessing  
We use MRI data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP). The 
MRI acquisition  protocols  have been extensively  described  and pre- 
sented elsewhere  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). In particular,  we used 50 subjects  
(see Supplementary  Appendix  A.6 for IDs) consisting  of 4 sessions  of RS 
scans (1200 volumes  each, a total of 4800 frames),  and 2 sessions  each 
of task fMRI data (i.e., working  memory,  relational  memory,  social, lan- 
guage, emotion,  and motor tasks). Functional  volumes  underwent  the 
standard  pre-processing  steps ( Van Dijk et al., 2010 ). All functional  im- 
ages were ﬁrst realigned  to the mean functional  volume  for each partici-  
pant. The realigned  volumes  were registered  to the structural  T1 data us- 
ing rigid-body  registration  (SPM12,  https://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk  ), and 
were detrended  (i.e., constant,  linear, quadratic)  to remove  signal drifts. 
Then, the images were smoothed  using a Gaussian  kernel with FWHM 
equal to 6mm. Finally,  we used the Automated  Anatomical  Labeling  
(AAL, 90 regions)  atlas that was re-sliced  to native fMRI space to par- 
cellate fMRI volumes  and compute  regionally  averaged  fMRI BOLD sig- 
nals. The structural  and diﬀusion-weighted  MRI data of each subject 
were downloaded  from the HCP and were processed  using MRtrix3  
( http://www.mrtrix.org/  ). We used single shell (b = 3000) multi-tissue  
to estimate  the response  function,  while ﬁber orientation  distribution  
functions  were computed  using constrained  spherical  deconvolution  of 
order 8. Tractogram  generation  was performed  using deterministic  trac- 
tography  with about 2 ×10 7 output streamlines  and was seeded from the 
white matter.  Fiber density  was used as metric to deﬁne the individual  
SCs and were computed  by dividing  the total number  of ﬁbers that con- 
nect each of the pairwise  regions  of the AAL atlas with both the mean 
ﬁber length and the average  of the sizes of the two regions  considered.  
The normalization  with respect to the region sizes is done to ensure 
that the strength  of the connection  is not biased towards  the size of the 
ROIs. The ﬁnal SC matrix was obtained  by averaging  all SC matrices  of 
all subjects.  
2.2. Graph Laplacian  mixture  model 
The GLMM is a generative  model assuming  that the observations  be- 
long to diﬀerent  types of signals with diﬀerent  underlying  graph struc- 
tures ( Petric Maretic  and Frossard,  2020 ). The graphs are unknown  and 
are modeled  by their graph Laplacian  matrix;  i.e., 𝑳 = 𝑫 − 𝑨 , where 𝑫 
is a diagonal  matrix of node degrees,  and 𝑨 is the weighted  adjacency  
matrix.  
The model estimation  problem  wants to ﬁt the observed  data to re- 
cover signal clusters,  as well as the associated  activation  patterns  and 
graph structures.  Speciﬁcally,  observed  fMRI signals are grouped  into 
clusters  deﬁned  by diﬀerent  unknown  brain activation  patterns.  The 
2  I. Ricchi, A. Tarun, H.P. Maretic et al. NeuroImage  252 (2022) 119037 
model recovers  these clusters,  characterized  by graph Laplacians  to- 
gether with the probability  of each cluster to occur. These graph Lapla- 
cians bring information  on the brain networks  activation  patterns  (es- 
timating  means),  functional  brain connectivity  structure  (Laplacians),  
and dynamics  (probability  of occurrence  as a function  of time). 
Formally,  each of the 𝑀observed  signals 𝒙 𝑚 ∈ℝ 𝑁 belongs  to exactly 
one cluster 𝑘 represented  by the graph Laplacian  𝑳 𝑘 ∈ℝ 𝑁×𝑁 and mean 
𝝁𝑘 ∈ℝ 𝑁 . A binary latent variable  𝒛 𝑚 ∈ℝ 𝐾 has exactly one non-zero  
value, which denotes  the cluster 𝑘 that 𝒙 𝑚 belongs  to. A probability  
𝛼𝑘 deﬁnes a prior probability  distribution  of 𝒙 𝑚 belonging  to cluster 𝑘 , 
namely  𝑝 ( 𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1) = 𝛼𝑘 , ∀𝑚 . 
Finally,  the graph Laplacian  𝑳 𝑘 ∈ℝ 𝑁×𝑁 models smooth  changes  in 
signals on the corresponding  graph. Large edge weight values in 𝑳 𝑘 thus 
capture  pairs of vertices  that change their values in similar ways. These 
connections  can be seen as partial correlations  between  two vertices  in 
a certain state ( Dempster,  1972 ). 
Under these assumptions,  signals in each cluster 𝑘 follow a Gaussian  
distribution  determined  through  the graph Laplacian  1 𝑥 ∼ ( 𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 −1 
𝑘 ) 
( Dong et al., 2016 ): with 𝐿 𝑘 = 𝐷 𝑘 − 𝑊 𝑘 . 
𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1) = 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 𝑘 ) =  ( 𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 −1 
𝑘 ) (1) 
Recall that the cluster of each signal is a priori unknown.  Marginalising  
over latent variables  𝑧 denoting  which cluster the signals belongs  to, we 
have: 
𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 ) = ∑
𝒛 𝑚 𝑝 ( 𝒛 𝑚 ) 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝒛 𝑚 ) (2) 
= 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝑝 ( 𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1) 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1) (3) 
= 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝛼𝑘  ( 𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 −1 
𝑘 ) , (4) 
s.t. 𝑳 𝑘 ∈ , ∀𝑘 (5) 
𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝛼𝑘 = 1 , (6) 
𝛼𝑘 > 0 , ∀𝑘 (7) 
Here (5) ensures  that all 𝑳 𝑘 ’s are valid Laplacian  matrices,   = { 𝑳 |𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 = 
𝐿 𝑗,𝑖 ≤ 0 , ∀𝑖 ≠𝑗 &∑𝑁 
𝑗=1 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 = 0 , ∀𝑖 } . Eqs. (6) and (7) ensure that 𝛼deﬁnes 
a valid probability  measure.

ℝ 𝑁×𝑀 , we want to recover  the parameters  of our generative  model (4) . 
To do so, we will look at the maximum  a posteriori  (MAP) estimate  for 
our parameters:  probabilities  𝜶= 𝛼1 , …, 𝛼𝐾 , means 𝝁= 𝝁1 , …, 𝝁𝐾 and 
graph Laplacians  𝑳 = 𝑳 1 , …, 𝑳 𝐾 . Namely,  we assume  the data has been 
sampled  independently  from the distribution  ( (4) ) deﬁned  through  the 
graph Laplacians.  In addition,  we take into account  the constraints  on 
the graph structure  given in (5), as well as possible  prior information  
on the graphs (such as sparsity),  and we maximise  over the a-posteriori  
distribution  of our model: 
arg max 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ln 𝑝 ( 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 |𝑿 ) (8) 
∝arg max 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ln 𝑝 ( 𝑿 |𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑳 ) (9) 
1 Note that 𝑳 −1 
𝑘 here denotes a pseudo-inverse  of the graph Laplacian  𝑳 𝑘 = arg max 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ln 𝑀 ∏
𝑚 =1 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑳 ) (10) 
= arg max 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 ln 𝑀 ∏
𝑚 =1 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝛼𝑘  ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝝁𝒌 , 𝑳 −𝟏 
𝒌 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑳 𝒌 ) (11) 
= arg max 𝜶, 𝝁, 𝑳 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 ln 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝛼𝑘  ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝝁𝒌 , 𝑳 −𝟏 
𝒌 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑳 𝒌 ) . (12) 
This problem  does not have a closed form solution.  It could be simpli- 
ﬁed through  posterior  probabilities  𝜸∈ℝ 𝑀×𝐾 , with 𝛾𝑚,𝑘 modeling  the 
probability  that the signal 𝒙 𝒎 belongs  to cluster 𝑘 : 
𝛾𝑚,𝑘 = 𝑝 ( 𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1 |𝒙 𝑚 , 𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 𝑘 ) (13) 
= 𝑝 ( 𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1) 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝑧 𝑚,𝑘 = 1 , 𝝁𝑘 , 𝑳 𝑘 ) 
∑𝐾 
𝑙=1 𝑝 ( 𝑧 𝑚,𝑙 = 1) 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝑧 𝑚,𝑙 = 1 , 𝝁𝑙 , 𝑳 𝑙 ) (14) 
= 𝛼𝑘  ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝝁𝒌 , 𝑳 −𝟏 
𝒌 ) 
∑𝐾 
𝑙=1 𝛼𝑙  ( 𝒙 𝑚 |𝝁𝒍 , 𝑳 −𝟏 
𝒍 ) (15) 
The parameters  𝜶, 𝝁and 𝑳 can now be estimated  iteratively  using 
an expectation  maximisation  (EM) algorithm,  in which the graph Lapla- 
cians 𝑳 are estimated  with a graph learning  scheme.  
It is worth noting that the graph learning  step includes  the graph pri- 
ors imposed  through  𝑝 ( 𝑳 𝑘 ) , including  the sparsity  prior which helps con- 
trol the sparsity/density  of the solution  and is directly  enforced  through  
the following  regularisation  term: 
− 𝛽1 ,𝑘 𝑡𝑟 ( 𝟏 𝑇 𝑙𝑜𝑔( diag ( 𝑳 𝑘 ))) + 𝛽2 ,𝑘 ‖𝑳 𝑘 ‖2 
𝐹, oﬀ. (16) 
The term diag( 𝑳 𝑘 ) is a vector with the diagonal  values (node degrees)  
from 𝑳 𝑘 , and ‖𝑳 𝑘 ‖2 
𝐹, oﬀis the Frobenius  norm of the oﬀ-diagonal  values 
in 𝑳 𝑘 . The graph learning  problem  naturally  provides  sparse solutions,  
while increasing  𝛽1 ,𝑘 strengthens  graph connectivity,  and increasing  𝛽2 ,𝑘 
promotes  density.  For a detailed  derivation  and analysis  of this part of 
the algorithm,  we refer to the appendix.

tions ( Isik et al., 2017 ; Masson  and Isik, 2021 ; Walbrin  et al., 2018 ) 
have highlighted  a region of the posterior  superior  temporal  sulcus 
(pSTS) as being selectively  involved  in the perception  of observed  so- 
cial interactions.  Notably,  this region is engaged  even by stimuli that 
contain  minimal  or even no realistic  human visual features.  For ex- 
ample, the pSTS is activated  by interactions  performed  by animated  
shapes ( Castelli  et al., 2000 ; Walbrin  et al., 2018 ), point-light  anima- 
tions ( Centelles  et al., 2011 ; Sapey-Triomphe  et al., 2017 ; Walbrin  et al., 
2018 ), and animated  mannikins  ( Georgescu  et al., 2014 ). Noting that 
the lateral temporal  cortex is a large region with a complex  proﬁle of 
responses  to social stimuli ( Allison et al., 2000 ; Deen et al., 2015 ), it 
is important  that neuroimaging  evidence  shows that the interaction-  
selective  pSTS region (SI-pSTS)  is anatomically  and functionally  disso- 
ciated from nearby regions  that are also implicated  in social processes.  
Speciﬁcally,  Isik et al. (2017) demonstrated  this by functionally  local- 
ising, at individual  level, the STS interaction-selective  region (SI-pSTS)  
along with motion-selective  hMT + , the face-selective  (fSTS) region, and 
the mentalizing-selective  region of TPJ. Anatomical  overlap  amongst  
these regions  was minimal;  and importantly,  selectivity  for observing  
simple social interactions  was signiﬁcantly  greater in the SI-pSTS  re- 
gion. 
However,  the SI-pSTS  is not the only posterior  region implicated  in 
visual interaction  perception.  Recent studies using static images of dyads 
who are either facing each other, or not, has suggested  that extrastri-  
ate body area (EBA), rather than the pSTS, is more uniquely  engaged  
by facing human dyads ( Abassi and Papeo, 2020 , 2021 ). In addition,  
two studies using dynamic  dyads that gesture  and/or move towards  vs. 
away from each other ﬁnd that the EBA, as well as pSTS, plays a role 
in processing  social interactions  ( Bellot et al., 2021 ; Walbrin  and Kold- 
ewyn, 2019 ). 
In sum, these studies point to candidate  brain regions  that contribute  
to interaction  perception,  and at the same time they suggest  that the 
distinction  between  moving  and static depictions  of interactions  may 
be an important  moderating  variable.  Previous  studies of interaction  
perception  have almost universally  presented  either static or dynamic  
stimuli but have not directly  assessed  the role of motion.  Therefore,  the 
present  paper investigates  the extent to which the interaction  selectivity  
of these brain regions  depends  on the presence  of dynamic  information,  
as this is critical for building  a full picture of how interactive  information  
is processed  and understood  in the human brain. 
There are good reasons  to suspect  that motion plays a key role in 
social interaction  perception  and that regions  sensitive  to interactive  in- 
formation  should also be sensitive  to (at least some) motion cues. First, 
as outlined  by Pitcher and Ungerleider  (2021) , the STS as a whole con- 
tains body and face selective  regions  that are more responsive  to moving  
than static faces and bodies. Second,  although  observers  are exquisitely  
sensitive  to static cues to interaction  such as facing direction,  proxim-  
ity, and touch in static scenes ( Zhou et al., 2019 ), interactions  by their 
very nature unfold dynamically.  Thus, it is intuitive  to expect that at 
least some regions  involved  in processing  social interactions  will do 
so preferentially  in response  to dynamic  stimuli.  Indeed,  Pitcher and 
Ungerleider  (2021) have proposed  a “third ”visual  pathway  that is spe- 
cialised  for dynamic  social perception,  a pathway  that stretches  from 
V1, through  motion-selective  middle temporal  cortex (hMT + ) and runs 
down the length of the STS. According  to that proposal,  both EBA and 
SI-pSTS  regions  would be expected  to show motion sensitivity,  although  
SI-pSTS  might be expected  to show greater sensitivity  to complex  social 
content.  
Accordingly,  in the present  study we factorially  manipulated  both 
“interactivity  ”and motion to identify  the contribution  of both factors,  
and the potential  interactions  between  them, on brain responses  (see 
Fig. 1 ). Stimuli  included  social interactions  as well as non-interactive  
scenes depicting  independent  actions that were matched  on high-level  
perceptual  features  such as actor identity  and gender,  and scene and 
object contents,  as well as on motion energy and physical  distance.  Or- 
thogonally,  in a design similar to that of Pitcher et al. (2011 ; see also Downing  et al., 2006 and Hasson  et al., 2008 ), scenes were presented  as 
dynamic  movies,  or as still frames that were extracted  from the interac-  
tion movies and that were either presented  in the correct sequence,  in 
a ﬁxed random  order, or else as a single “key ”image.  
A further important  advance  of the present  work over many previ- 
ous studies is that we presented  social interactions  that were depicted  
in a range of naturalistic  everyday  settings  and using a variety of in- 
teractive  cues. A small number  of previous  studies have taken a sim- 
ilar naturalistic  approach  to related issues. One such study presented  
short video clips of computer  animations  depicting  a range of social 
(e.g., faces, bodies and social interactions)  and non-social  (e.g., objects,  
houses and non-social  interactions)  features,  ﬁnding  that although  the 
posterior  temporal  cortex in general  responded  more to social com- 
pared to non-social  stimuli,  the pSTS showed  a signiﬁcant  increase  in re- 
sponse for all eight identiﬁed  social features,  including  social interaction  
( Lahnakoski  et al., 2012 ). Taking this one step further,  two recent stud- 
ies have analysed  data collected  while participants  viewed  TV episodes  
or excerpts  from movies ( Masson  and Isik, 2021 ; Wagner  et al., 2016 ). 
Wagner  et al. (2016) found that medial prefrontal  cortex (mPFC)  was 
most involved  in processing  naturalistic  social interactions  and specu- 
lated that this was because  social interactions  trigger spontaneous  men- 
talising  processes.  Masson  and Isik (2021) , however,  found bilateral  
pSTS to be most involved  in social interaction  perception.  They assessed  
the contribution  of both mentalising  processes  and social interaction  
perception,  concluding  that social interactions  explained  unique vari- 
ance in the response  of the pSTS to naturalistic  scenes in a way that 
was not replicated  in “canonical  ”ToM regions,  including  mPFC. While 
some of this work has assessed  motion as one perceptual  feature amongst  
many, it leaves open key questions  about the ways that motion drives 
the response  to interactions  in social perception  regions.  
The existing  literature  outlined  above points to a diverse  set of 
known temporal  and occipito-temporal  brain regions  that may con- 
tribute to social interaction  perception.  Accordingly,  we adopted  a func- 
tional localiser  approach  (e.g., Kanwisher,  2017 ; Saxe et al., 2006 ), iden- 
tifying key regions  of interest  with independent  localiser  datasets  in 
each participant,  and measuring  the response  of these regions  to the 
interactive  and control stimuli described  above (see Fig. 2 ). These re- 
gions of interest  (ROIs) included:  SI-pSTS,  deﬁned  by greater response  
to interacting  than non-interacting  point-light  dyads ( Isik et al., 2017 ; 
Walbrin  et al., 2018 ); EBA and its ventral counterpart  the fusiform  body 
area (FBA; Peelen and Downing,  2005a ; Schwarzlose  et al., 2005 ) lo- 
calised by a selective  response  to human bodies; a TPJ ROI implicated  
in mentalising,  localised  by contrasting  selected  epochs within a brief 
movie ( Jacoby et al., 2016 ); and motion-selective  hMT + , localised  with 
a contrast  of simple visual motion vs a static control ( Tootell et al., 
1995 ). 
For two of these regions,  clear hypotheses  about the individual  and 
combined  eﬀects of motion and interaction  content  are possible.  First, 
we hypothesised  that the SI-pSTS  ROI would be more responsive  to in- 
teractive  than non-interactive  scenes and would also be more respon-  
sive to dynamic  than static conditions.  However,  we also expected  that 
these two factors would interact  such that the diﬀerence  between  so- 
cial conditions  would be largest in the video condition;  that is, that the 
SI-pSTS  would show higher interaction  sensitivity  when scenes are pre- 
sented dynamically.  We also expected  that the SI-pSTS  would be more 
responsive  to interactive  information  when static scenes in sequences  
were shown in a coherent  order, with intact implied  motion cues, than 
when presented  in a scrambled  order. Second,  and in contrast  to SI- 
pSTS, we hypothesised  that EBA would show a main eﬀect of motion 
(see Downing  et al., 2001 ), but only weak sensitivity  to interactive  infor- 
mation.  We did not expect EBA to be particularly  sensitive  to interactive  
information  in dynamic  scenes, but instead  expected  that EBA might be 
more responsive  to interactive  cues conveyed  through  static body cues, 
in line with prior work ( Abassi and Papeo, 2020 , 2021 ). 
Further  occipito-temporal  regions  of interest  served as controls  to 
determine  the spatial and functional  speciﬁcity  of responses  to social

interactions.  The bilateral  TPJ ROI identiﬁed  in a theory-of-mind  con- 
trast was included  because  it is spatially  very near SI-pSTS,  and is clearly 
implicated  in social cognition,  but (based on previous  ﬁndings)  was not 
expected  to be especially  sensitive  to motion nor to the combined  ef- 
fects of motion and social interaction  ( Walbrin  et al., 2019 , 2020 ). Given 
the key role of human bodies in depicting  natural  interactions,  FBA re- 
sponses  were compared  to those of EBA. Previous  dissociations  in the 
functional  properties  of these two body-selective  regions  ( Ewbank  et al., 
2011 ; Schwarzlose  et al., 2008 ; Taylor and Downing,  2011 ) and their 
location  in distinct  neuroanatomical  pathways  ( Pitcher and Ungerlei-  der, 2021 ) indicated  the possibility  of distinct  responses  to social inter- 
actions between  these counterpart  regions.  Finally,  as a reality check, 
we included  hMT + as a region that is generally  responsive  to motion 
and optic ﬂow, which we expected  should be clearly modulated  by our 
motion manipulation  without  showing  sensitivity  to the interactiveness  
of the scenes. 
We used these functional  localisers  to test our hypotheses  with two 
complementary  analytical  approaches.  First, standard  univariate  anal- 
yses revealed  the magnitude  of response  to the conditions  of the main 
experiment  in each ROI. These analyses  indexed  the degree to which

individually  deﬁned  social brain regions  are diﬀerentially  activated,  on 
the whole, to social interactions.  Second,  we adopted  a multivoxel  re- 
gression  approach  to assess how, over a broad occipitotemporal  region, 
the various  speciﬁc  selectivities  that were measured  in the localiser  data 
(e.g., to static bodies, or to simple visual motion)  jointly predicted  the re- 
sponse to social interactions.  These analyses  allowed  a more continuous  
view of selectivity,  capitalising  on local variation  in response  proﬁles  
rather than relying on binary classiﬁcations  of regions  as selective  or 
not for a given property.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-four  right-handed  participants  were recruited  to take part 
in this study, two of which were removed  from the analyses  due to 
excessive  head motion (see 2.6 MRI pre-processing  section for details).  
Thus, the ﬁnal sample consisted  of 22 participants  (mean age = 21.59, 
SD = 2.11, 6 male). All participants  had normal  or corrected  to normal  
vision, provided  written  informed  consent,  and were fully debriefed  at 
the end of the study. Participants  received  monetary  compensation  for 
taking part. The study was approved  by the Ethics Committee  of the 
School of Psychology  at Bangor University  and was pre-registered  on 
AsPredicted  ID 52,482 on 18/11/2020.  
2.2. Design & procedure  
To investigate  sensitivity  to diﬀerent  levels of motion in social inter- 
actions and non-interactions,  the main experimental  task consisted  of a 
2 (Scene:  Social interaction  vs non-interaction)  ×4 (Motion:  Dynamic  
videos, image sequences,  scrambled  image sequences,  static images)  re- 
peated measures  fMRI block design (see Fig. 1 A). 
Experimental  conditions  were presented  in blocks of stimuli followed  
by a short response  block. Stimulus  blocks contained  four 4-second  stim- 
ulus trials, each preceded  by a 0.5-second  black ﬁxation  cross on a grey 
background  (18 s total). For video stimuli,  four 4-second  videos were 
shown. For image sequences,  four sequences  of four 1-second  images 
each were shown in the correct order. For scrambled  image sequences,  
four sequences  of the same quadruplet  1-second  images from the image 
sequence  blocks were shown in a consistent  pseudorandom  order. For 
static images,  four images were shown for 4-seconds  each. 
Every stimulus  block was followed  by a 4-second  response  block: 2 s 
ﬁxation  before a unique response  image probe was shown for 2 s (thus 
22-second  total experimental  block duration).  Participants  were asked 
to identify,  within the 2-second  presentation  time, whether  the scenario  depicted  in the response  image had been part of the stimulus  presen-  
tation phase of the current  block with a dichotomous  yes/no response.  
This was coded such that there was a 50/50 chance of the scenario  hav- 
ing been shown. For an illustration  of this procedure,  refer to Fig. 1 B. 
Functional  data were acquired  across four runs lasting 400 s each. 
Each functional  run contained  two blocks of each experimental  condi- 
tion (22 s each, 16 blocks per run) and three rest blocks (16 s each) at 
the beginning,  middle,  and end of the run. The order of blocks in each 
run was palindromic  and pseudorandomised  across runs such that each 
of the eight blocks was presented  at a diﬀerent  point in each run. A 
total of eight runs were created,  four of which were chosen at random  
for each participant,  but all runs were shown an equal number  of times 
across the study. 
The experiment  was created  using PsychoPy  3 ( Peirce et al., 2019 ) 
running  on Linux Ubuntu  18.04.

that inter-individual  variability  in intrinsic  functional  connectivity  
during resting-state  fMRI may also be related to individual  diﬀerences  
in cognitive  domain  ( Mueller  et al., 2013 ). 
To further transit the investigations  from group level to single sub- 
jects, Fin et al. adopted  an identiﬁcation  procedure  using functional  con- 
nectivity  proﬁles  as a “ﬁngerprint  ”t o identify  a subject from a large 
database,  and proved that individual  variability  is substantial  and re- 
producible  and is predictive  of individual’s  ﬂuid intelligence  ( Finn et al., 
2015 ). Using similar methods,  a study by Kaufmann  et al. reported  that 
the connectome  develops  into a more stable, individual  wiring pattern  
during adolescence  and that delayed  stabilization  and individualization  
in this connectome  development  are related to psychiatric  disorders  
( Kaufmann  et al., 2017 ). Furthermore,  a recent study showed  that the 
performance  of idiographic  models in pain prediction  could be improved  
through  a group regularization  approach  ( Lindquist  et al., 2017 ). These 
ﬁndings  indicated  that each individual  had a unique functional  connec-  
tome pattern  which may underlie  a person’s  behavioral  traits and can 
be captured  by fMRI. 
In the ﬁeld of pain neuroimaging,  individual  diﬀerences  in pain- 
related brain activity  was found to be correlated  with individual  diﬀer- 
ences in subjective  ratings of experimental  pain stimuli ( Coghill  et al., 
2003 ) and even the intrinsic  functional  connectivity  during rest was 
found to be predictive  of individual’s  pain threshold  ( Tu et al., 2019 ). 
Existing  evidence  also suggests  that demographic  factors such as gender-  
( Aubrun  et al., 2005 ; Fillingim  et al., 2009 ; Wise et al., 2002 ), ethnic- 
( Anderson  et al., 2009 ; Broderick  et al., 2016 ; Cruz-Almeida  et al., 
2014 ), socioeconomic-  ( Reddan,  2021 ; Vachon-Presseau  et al., 2019 ), 
and age-related  diﬀerences  ( Aubrun  et al., 2005 ; Edwards  et al., 2003 ) 
and pain-related  behavior  such as fear of pain ( Yang et al., 2016 ) and 
anxiety  ( Tseng et al., 2017 ) could all contribute  to individual  diﬀerences  
in brain activity  and consequently  to individualities  in pain perception.  
Therefore,  we hypothesized  that the uniqueness  of each individual’s  sub- 
jective pain perception  may be reﬂected  by the uniqueness  of the under- 
lying brain activation  patterns  recorded  by fMRI which can thus be used 
as a “ﬁngerprint  ”for individual  identiﬁcation  in the context  of pain. Fur- 
thermore,  it also remains  unclear  whether  the individual  identiﬁability  
(i.e., how successfully  an individual  can be identiﬁed  from a group of 
subjects)  based on pain-elicited  brain activation  patterns  varies across 
individuals;  if so, whether  such individual  identiﬁability  is associated  
with pain-related  behavior.  
Therefore,  in the present  study, we aimed to test (1) whether  tran- 
sient nociceptive  stimuli elicit a unique brain activation  pattern  in 
each individual  by performing  an individual  identiﬁcation  analysis  us- 
ing pain-elicited  brain activation  patterns  as “ﬁngerprint  ”; (2) whether  
the pain-elicited-activation-based  individual  identiﬁability  measured  by 
identiﬁcation  accuracy  of each individual  reﬂects  a person’s  pain behav- 
ior; and (3) whether  the individuality  of brain activation  patterns  and its 
relationship  with pain-related  behaviors  are speciﬁc  to pain by repeating  
the above analyses  but using brain activation  patterns  elicited  by non- 
painful,  tactile stimuli.  As the individual  identiﬁability  is determined  
by both intra-individual  variability  and inter-individual  variability  in 
pain-elicited  brain activation  patterns,  we also examined  the relation-  
ships among individual  identiﬁability,  intra-individual  variability,  inter- 
individual  variability,  and pain behavioral  measures  across individuals.  
In addition,  these individual  identiﬁcation  analyses  were performed  for 
the whole brain as well as for each region of the entire brain to test 
whether  and how the individual  identiﬁability  varies across distinct  re- 
gions in the brain.

Fig. 1. Light bulb purchasing  task trial. Trial structure  included  screens presenting  the image of a CFL light bulb (2 s), and the product’s  Energy Star label (or a blue

tional Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  or FMRI) with experimental  designs  
from psychology  and economics,  researchers  can visualize  and quan- 
tify diﬀerent  aﬀective  and deliberative  processes  that promote  and pre- 
dict choice across diverse  domains  ( Knutson  et al., 2008 ; Tom et al., 
2007 ). For instance,  neuroimaging  research  has shed light on neu- 
ral mechanisms  associated  with a range of purchases  – including  sus- 
tainable  products  ( Goucher-Lambert  et al., 2017 ) and organic  labels 
( Linder et al., 2010 ), as well as responses  to environmental  advertise-  
ments ( Vezich et al., 2017 ) and appeals  for environmental  conserva-  
tion ( Brevers  et al., 2021 ; Khaw et al., 2015 ; Sawe and Knutson,  2015 ). 
Neuroeconomic  experimental  design allows researchers  to disentangle  
diﬀerent  neural responses  to discrete  elements  of a choice proposition  
(e.g., product  attributes)  that appear during speciﬁc  temporal  phases of 
decision-making  within individuals  ( Hare et al., 2010 ; Knutson  et al., 
2007 ; Sawe, 2017 ). Further  research  has focused  on individual  dif- 
ferences  in preferences  for sooner but smaller  rewards,  also called 
“delay discounting  ”( Ballard  and Knutson,  2009 ; Hariri et al., 2006 ; 
McClure  et al., 2004 ). Finally,  more recent “neuroforecasting  ”research  
has examined  whether  neural data from limited samples  of subjects  (e.g., 
∼40) can forecast  demand  for products  or propositions  out-of-sample  
( Knutson  and Genevsky,  2018 ). Thus, neuroeconomic  techniques  oﬀer 
a powerful  but ﬂexible  methodological  toolkit for understanding  how 
ecolabels  might promote  sustainable  purchases  across levels of analysis.  
To examine  the inﬂuence  of ecolabels  on sustainable  purchases  
across diﬀerent  levels of analysis,  we recruited  thirty-six  subjects  to un- 
dergo FMRI while choosing  whether  to purchase  Compact  Fluorescent  
Lamp (CFL) light bulbs that varied independently  with respect to the 
presence  or absence  of an Energy Star label, as well as in annual en- 
ergy costs and price ( Fig. 1 ). Subjects  then completed  several individual  
diﬀerence  measures  (including  measures  of environmental  concern  and 
delay discounting)  ( Kirby and Marakovic,  1996 ). Finally,  a diﬀerent  and 
larger group of 1550 U.S. homeowners  completed  a stated choice sur- 
vey featuring  similar products  to those presented  in the neuroimaging  
experiment  ( Sahoo and Sawe, 2015 ). 
We sought to test whether  activity  in speciﬁc  neural circuits  would 
respond  to the Energy Star label and predict light bulb purchasing  
choices  within individual  subjects.  Further,  we examined  whether  neu- 
ral activity  could explain  individual  diﬀerences  in responsiveness  to the 
Energy Star label. Finally,  we tested whether  group-averaged  brain re- 
sponses  to sustainable  product  combinations  could forecast  choice out- 
of-sample  in the national  survey.  Consistent  with an account  in which 
the Energy Star label increases  product  attractiveness  rather than de- 
liberation  about long-term  savings,  we predicted  that neural activity  in 
circuits  associated  with aﬀect rather than deliberation  would increase  
in response  to Energy Star labels and predict choice within individuals,  
that this would be more pronounced  in impulsive  individuals,  and that 
averaged  group neural responses  might even correlate  with demand  for 
sustainable  products  in the nationally-representative  survey sample.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
Thirty-eight  healthy  right-handed  English-speaking  adults who paid 
their own utility bills participated  in the neuroimaging  study. Subjects  had no history of neurological  or psychiatric  disorders  and did not meet 
any of the typical magnetic  resonance  exclusion  criteria  (e.g., current  
use of psychotropic  or cardiac  medications,  metal in the body). One sub- 
ject was excluded  for excessive  head motion ( > 2 mm from one brain ac- 
quisition  to the next), and a second was excluded  after identiﬁcation  of a 
signiﬁcant  congenital  brain malformation,  leaving  a total of 36 subjects  
for analysis  (19 females,  mean age 29.6 ± 5.5 years). Subjects  received  
an endowment  of $10.00 minus the amount  they used to purchase  a light 
bulb on a randomly-selected  trial (see below),  as well as $20.00/hour  
for participating.  The research  was approved  by the Institutional  Review  
Board of the Stanford  University  School of Medicine.  
2.2. Scanning  task 
Before the experiment,  subjects  were notiﬁed  that light bulbs were 
discounted  75% oﬀ retail  price to encourage  suﬃcient  purchasing  
for later choice prediction  analyses,  consistent  with previous  research  
( Knutson  et al., 2007 ). Subjects  were presented  with background  in- 
formation  about the Energy Star program’s  energy eﬃciency  certiﬁ- 
cation requirements  and an explanation  of the meaning  of annual en- 
ergy cost. Subjects  were advised  not to concern  themselves  with mi- 
nor aesthetic  diﬀerences  between  bulb images,  which only represented  
currently  available  products.  Eﬀorts were also made to control for the 
apparent  light bulb warmth  by minimizing  variation  in the hue and sat- 
uration  of light bulb images.  
During scanning,  subjects  chose whether  to buy 64 CFL light bulbs 
which independently  varied with respect to three attributes:  (1) the 
presence  or absence  of an Energy Star label; (2) annual energy cost 
(given average  use); and (3) purchase  price. As in previous  research  
( Knutson  et al., 2007 ), attributes  were presented  sequentially  (for 4 s 
each), followed  by a choice period (with response  options  presented  on 
the right or left side of the screen in a counterbalanced  fashion;  4 s; 
Fig. 1 ). Trials were presented  in two blocks of 32 trials each (lasting  
704 s per block). To ensure incentive  compatibility,  one trial was ran- 
domly selected  to count as a binding  decision  at the conclusion  of the 
experiment.  If the subject had chosen to purchase  on that trial, the light 
bulb’s price was deducted  from their $10 endowment  and the light bulb 
was then sent to the subject;  otherwise,  subjects  kept their full endow-  
ment. 
Though  optimal  methods  for presenting  energy consumption  infor- 
mation are under debate,  presenting  annual energy cost has been shown 
to reduce implicit  discounting  of energy eﬃciency  by a factor of ﬁve 
( Min et al., 2014 ). Therefore,  to increase  consistency  with information  
typically  presented  to consumers  in survey research  as well as product  
combinations  in the national  stated choice survey,  we presented  energy 
consumption  as annual energy cost, with ranges of annual energy costs 
($1.12–$1.78)  and product  prices ($0.61–$2.19  after discount)  drawn 
from those of CFL light bulbs presented  in the national  stated choice 
experiment.  
After exiting the scanner,  subjects  completed  the full stated choice 
task used in the national  survey (see below; Supplementary  Fig. 1). 
Subjects  also reported  basic demographic  information  (e.g., age, house- 
hold income),  and completed  individual  diﬀerence  measures  of pro- 
environmental  attitudes  ( Dunlap  et al., 2000 ) and delay discounting  
( Kirby and Marakovic,  1996 ).

Table 1 
Common  terms used throughout  this paper and their deﬁnitions.  We note that there are traditional  terms that are widely used, but are not technically  or biologically  
precise; in this table, we emphasize  such terms and encourage  the avoidance  of their usage in future studies. 
Term Deﬁnition  
Tractography  / Fiber tracking Any computational  process that estimates  the anatomical  trajectories  of the white matter ﬁber pathways  from dMRI data. 
Note : The term “Fiber tracing ”and “Fiber tracking ”are also widely used. However,  we strongly suggest avoiding this term 
because “tracing ”is frequently  used in the context of ex vivo tracer injections,  and “tracking  ”refers to following  a moving 
object while white matter ﬁbers do not move. 
Streamline  A set of ordered points in 3D space, encoding  a trajectory  estimated  through performing  tractography  (see Fig. 1 (b)). Note : 
The term “ﬁber ”is also widely used. However,  we strongly suggest avoiding this term because “ﬁber ”is in reference  to 
biology, while “streamline  ”implies  the digital reconstruction  of such. 
Tractogram  A set of streamlines,  often generated  in such a way as to cover the entire white matter of the brain in order to capture any 
possible white matter connections.  This can be referred to as a “whole-brain  tractogram  ”(see Fig. 1 (c)). 
Steamline  cluster/ Streamline  connection/  
Streamlines  within an edge/ White matter 
parcel A set of streamlines  resulting from the subdivision  of a tractogram.  Such sets can result from a variety of methods for 
dividing the tractogram;  hence there are several names in use for them. While such a set is often called a “ﬁber bundle, ”
“ﬁber tract, ”or “ﬁber cluster ”in the literature,  to clarify that a set of streamlines  is a computational  data representation,  
we avoid using the word “ﬁber ”in this paper. 
Fiber Bundle / Fiber Tract / Fiber Fasciculus  / 
Fiber Pathway These terms have biological  meanings  as a set of white matter ﬁbers (axons) forming a corticocortical  or corticosubcortical  
connection  in the brain ( Schmahmann,  Schmahmann,  Pandya, 2009 ). In the neuroimaging  literature,  these terms are 
commonly  used instead to refer to white matter connections  reconstructed  using tractography.  Following  this practice, in 
this paper we will use the terms “ﬁber tract, ”“ﬁber bundle, ”“ﬁber fasciculus,  ”or “ﬁber pathway ”to refer to a white 
matter structure  that corresponds  to known anatomy with a traditional  name (e.g., the corpus callosum or the 
corticospinal  tract) (see Fig. 1 (d)). 
Brain Connectivity  In neuroimaging,  the somewhat  elusive and ambiguous  concept of brain connectivity  refers to measures  of the structural  
and/or functional  relationship  between diﬀerent brain regions ( Horwitz, 2003; Rossini et al., 2019; Sakkalis, 2011; Uddin, 
2013 ). 
Structural  Connectivity  A speciﬁc type of brain connectivity.  Two brain regions are structurally  connected  if a ﬁber tract physically  interconnects  
them. This is typically measured  in vivo in humans using dMRI. However,  there is no consensus  on how this should be best 
quantiﬁed.  Structural  connectivity  measures  (also called “weights ”or “strengths  ”) can include a variety of quantitative  
connectivity  measures  computed  from a speciﬁc set of streamlines  corresponding  to a pathway of interest (e.g. those 
connecting  two speciﬁc endpoints).  The goal is often to approximate  the true underlying  ﬁber density or number of axons 
( Jones, 2010 ; Smith et al., 2020a ). 
Connectome  / Brain Connectivity  Matrix A two-dimensional  matrix wherein the rows and columns correspond  to speciﬁc brain gray matter regions of interest 
(ROIs), and the value stored within each element of the matrix is the computed  connectivity  “strength  ”between  those 
regions corresponding  to that row & column ( Sporns, Tononi, Kötter, 2005 ) (see Fig. 1 (e)). Such data are described  
mathematically  as a graph. This matrix representation  is directly inspired by invasive axonal tract-tracing  experiments  in 
animals, where the results of multiple studies are expressed  as a quantitative  connectivity  matrix ( Wakker et al., 2012 ). 
Without further speciﬁcation,  we use “connectome  ”throughout  to implicitly  refer to the structural  connectome  constructed  
using dMRI tractography,  as opposed to those derived through other imaging modalities  (e.g., functional  MRI). 
Diﬀusion  Model A theoretical  model that connects the dMRI signal to salient features of tissue microstructure  at the cellular level 
( Novikov et al., 2018 ; Panagiotaki  et al., 2012 ; Yablonskiy  and Sukstanskii,  2010 ). This includes tissue microstructure  or 
biophysical  models such as Neurite Orientation  Dispersion  and Density Imaging (NODDI) ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) and Free 
Water (FW) ( Pasternak  et al., 2012, 2009 , as well as diﬀusion signal representations  that include the diﬀusion tensor 
( Basser and Pierpaoli,  1996 ), diﬀusion kurtosis ( Jensen and Helpern, 2010 ) and many others ( Afzali et al., 2020 ; 
Alexander,  2006 ). 
Microstructural  Measure Any parameter  extracted  from a diﬀusion model ﬁt in each voxel that provides information  regarding  the underlying  tissue 
microstructure  (e.g., the fractional  anisotropy  (FA) that describes  water diﬀusion anisotropy  ( Basser and Pierpaoli,  2011 )). 
Tractometry  / Proﬁlometry  / Tract-based  
morphometry  An along-tract  proﬁling analysis technique  to investigate  the distribution  of the microstructural  measures  along the ﬁber 
pathway ( Bells et al., 2011b ; O’Donnell  et al., 2009 ; Yeatman et al., 2012 ). 
vide a visualization  of many key concepts  that will be used in the paper 
( Fig. 1 ). 
Many quantitative  tractography  approaches  can be applied  to study 
the brain’s structural  connectivity  in health and disease.  The funda- 
mental goal of these analyses  is to estimate  quantitative  measures  of 
connectivity  (or microstructure)  of some pathway  (or pathways)  of in- 
terest. Quantitative  analyses  of tractography  can be categorized  into 
two main categories  or styles: tract-speciﬁc  analyses  and connectome-  
based analyses  (this categorization  is helpful but imperfect,  as some ap- 
proaches  blend aspects  of both analysis  styles). Tract-speciﬁc  analysis  
refers to research  that is typically  hypothesis-driven  and studies partic- 
ular anatomical  ﬁber tracts ( Alexander  et al., 2007; Levitt et al., 2020; 
Shany et al., 2017; Yeo et al., 2014 ). Tract-speciﬁc  analysis  has been 
increasingly  adopted,  particularly  for the study of local white matter re- 
gions in health and disease  ( Alexander  et al., 2007; Shany et al., 2017; 
Yeo et al., 2014 ). Connectome-based  analysis  refers to research  that is 
more data-driven  and generally  studies the structural  connectivity  of 
the entire brain ( Bastiani  et al., 2012; Ingalhalikar  et al., 2014; Sporns 
et al., 2005; Zalesky  et al., 2012 ). This type of analysis  aims to under- 
stand patterns  of whole-brain  anatomical  connectivity,  and therefore  
relies on tractography  performed  across the entire white matter.  In this paper, we ﬁrst provide  a brief introduction  to tractography  
( Section  2 ), then a review of methodology  for quantitative  tractogra-  
phy analysis  ( Sections  3 –5 ), followed  by a review of studies that use 
quantitative  tractography  analysis  to study the brain in health and dis- 
ease ( Section  6 ). For the methodology  review,  we organize  the paper 
according  to three main processing  steps that are common  across most 
approaches  for quantitative  analysis  of tractography.  The ﬁrst common  
step corrects  potential  biases in tractography  reconstruction  that may 
otherwise  be detrimental  to, or outright  preclude,  quantitative  analy- 
sis of such data; we refer to this as tractography  correction  ( Section  3 ). 
The second common  processing  step identiﬁes  white matter pathways  
(e.g., subdivisions  of the tractogram)  that are meaningful  for quantiﬁca-  
tion of brain connectivity;  we refer to this as tractography  segmentation  
( Section  4 ). The third common  step extracts  quantitative  indices that 
describe  the microstructure  and/or the “strength  ”of the brain connec-  
tions; we refer to this as tractography  quantiﬁcation  ( Section  5 ). In each 
section,  we aim to describe  methodological  choices,  their popularity,  
and their potential  pros and cons. Finally,  we review studies that have 
used quantitative  tractography  approaches  to study the brain’s white 
matter,  including  applications  in development,  aging, neurological  dis- 
orders, mental disorders,  and neurosurgery  ( Section  6 ).

connection  between  the two corresponding  ROIs (quantiﬁed  as the number of streamlines  in this case). 
2. Brief introduction  to tractography  
“Tractography  ”c a n refer to any computational  process  that esti- 
mates the anatomical  trajectories  of white matter ﬁber pathways  from 
dMRI data. There are many methods  available  to perform  tractography,  
including  traditional  streamline  tractography  based on the diﬀusion  ten- 
sor model ( Basser et al., 2000; Basser and Pierpaoli,  1996 ), which was 
originally  proposed  (as “hyperstreamlines  ”) for the visualization  of ten- 
sor ﬁelds in the computer  graphics  community  in 1993 ( Delmarcelle  and 
Hesselink,  1993 ). More recently,  many streamline  tractography  methods  
using advanced  diﬀusion  models have been proposed  and are under ac- 
tive development  ( Behrens  et al., 2007; Descoteaux  et al., 2008; Feng 
and He, 2020; Fernandez-Miranda  et al., 2012; Friman  et al., 2006; Jack- 
owski et al., 2005; Jeurissen  et al., 2014; Lazar and Alexander,  2005; 
Malcolm  et al., 2010; Reddy and Rathi, 2016; Tournier  et al., 2010; 
2003; Wasserthal  et al., 2019 ). Furthermore,  many alternative  tractog-  
raphy algorithms  have been proposed,  such as front evolution  ( Pichon 
et al., 2005; Sepasian  et al., 2012; Tournier  et al., 2003 ), geodesic  
(identifying  likely connection  trajectories  based on assumed  endpoints)  
( Jbabdi et al., 2008; 2007; Li et al., 2014; O’Donnell  et al., 2002; 
Schreiber  et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2009 ), atlas-based  ( Wasserthal  et al., 
2019; Yendiki  et al., 2011 ), diﬀerential  tractography  ( Yeh et al., 2019b ) 
and various  forms of “global  ” tractography  that simultaneously  ﬁt the 
entire tractography  reconstruction  to all image data (either by progres-  
sively forming  linked chains from a large set of randomly-initialized  
short segments  ( Christiaens  et al., 2015; Fillard et al., 2009; Kreher et al., 
2008; Mangin  et al., 2013; Mangin  et al., 2002; Reisert et al., 2011; Teil- 
lac et al., 2017 )or iteratively  perturbing  a set of candidate  trajectories  ( Battocchio  et al., 2020; Close et al., 2015; Lemkaddem  et al., 2014; Wu 
et al., 2012b ). Work is additionally  underway  to improve  tractography  
using machine  learning  ( Neher et al., 2017; Poulin et al., 2019; Sarwar 
et al., 2020; Wasserthal  et al., 2019; Wegmayr  et al., 2018 ). 
While a detailed  introduction  of tractography  methods  is out of 
the scope of this review,  we refer the readers  to these review papers 
( Jeurissen  et al., 2019; Neher et al., 2015; Rheault  et al., 2020b; Smith 
et al., 2020c ) that are speciﬁc  to tractography  algorithms.  
Many software  packages  are available  to perform  tractography  
research,  including  ANIMA  ( Descoteaux  et al., 2008 ), BrainSUITE  
( Shattuck  and Leahy, 2002 ), Camino  ( Cook et al., 2006 ), COMMIT  
( Daducci  et al., 2013; 2014; Ocampo-Pineda  et al., 2021; Schiavi  et al.,

2014 ), DMIPY ( Fick et al., 2019 ), DSI studio ( Yeh et al., 2013 ), DTIs- 
tudio ( Jiang et al., 2006 ), ExploreDTI  ( Leemans  et al., 2009 ), Fiber-

( Cui et al., 2013 ), SlicerDMRI  ( Norton et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020b ), 
TractSeg  ( Wasserthal  et al., 2018 ), and Tracula  ( Yendiki  et al., 2011 ). 
It is important  to note that tractography  is known to be sensitive  to 
the choice of the underlying  ﬁber tracking  algorithms,  which can fur- 
ther aﬀect any subsequent  quantitative  analyses  using the tractography  
data. On one hand, tractography  results may vary across the large set of 
available  diﬀusion  models ( Afzali et al., 2020; Alexander,  2006; Pana- 
giotaki et al., 2012; Yablonskiy  and Sukstanskii,  2010 ) and tractography  
methods  ( Basser et al., 2000; Behrens  et al., 2007; Descoteaux  et al., 
2008; Feng and He, 2020; Fernandez-Miranda  et al., 2012; Friman  et al., 
2006; Jackowski  et al., 2005; Jeurissen  et al., 2014; Lazar and Alexan-

der, 2005; Malcolm  et al., 2010; Reddy and Rathi, 2016; Tournier  et al., 
2010; 2003; Wasserthal  et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, tractography  
results can also be sensitive  to the choice of parameters  (such as seed- 
ing and stopping  thresholds)  within a certain algorithm  ( Chamberland  
et al., 2014; Côtéet al., 2013; Gong et al., 2018; Moldrich  et al., 2010; 
Xie et al., 2020 ). While many research  studies have been performed  to 
compare  diﬀerent  tractography  algorithms  ( Bastiani  et al., 2012; Fillard 
et al., 2011; Petrov et al., 2017; Pujol et al., 2015; Sinke et al., 2018; 
Wilkins  et al., 2015; Zhan et al., 2015 ), there is no consensus  on “the 
best algorithm.  ”",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5958, 5961), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(15318, 15321), match='\n3.'>"

deposits  ( Honig et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003 ), but could be a potential  
mechanism  through  which cardiovascular  disease  directly  impacts  brain 
health ( Honjo et al., 2012 ). To better understand  the potential  role of 
atherosclerosis  in cognitive  impairment,  we sought to compare  (1) cog- 
nitive performance,  (2) central hemodynamic  changes,  and (3) patterns  
of functional  brain activity  using functional  near infrared  spectroscopy  
(fNIRS)  in older adults with and without  carotid atherosclerosis  during 
an incongruous  Stroop color-word  task. 
The participants  in this work were part of the Insight 46 neuroscience  
sub-study  of the National  Survey of Health and Development  (NSHD).  
NSHD is an ongoing  British birth cohort study where social, lifestyle,  
cognitive  and physical  data from over 5000 individuals  born within the 
same week in 1946 has been assessed  over the course of the participants’  
lives ( James et al., 2018; Kuh et al., 2011; 2016 ). A sub-sample  of 502 
NSHD participants  volunteered  for the Insight 46 study, which is de- 
signed to explore  preclinical  dementia  and the causes/consequences  of 
cerebrovascular  amyloid  pathology  on brain health through  a battery  of 
clinical,  neurosychological,  imaging,  biomarker,  genetic,  and vascular  
assessments  ( Lane et al., 2017; Mason et al., 2020 ). Insight 46 provides  
a powerful  opportunity  to investigate  the mechanisms  of early cogni- 
tive decline  as many participants  in this study (aged 72 - 73) likely ex- 
hibit subclinical  pathophysiological  changes  such as amyloid  pathology  
and atherosclerosis  yet have a low risk of overt dementia  ( Prince et al., 
2014 ). 
The extensive  phenotyping  protocol  performed  as part of the Insight 
46 study involves  psychometric  testing using fNIRS ( Mason et al., 2020 ). 
fNIRS is an optical technique  whereby  changes  in concentration  of oxy- 
genated  hemoglobin  (O2Hb)  and deoxygenated  hemoglobin  (HHB) in 
the cerebral  microvasculature  of the cortical  surface can be detected  
( Bunce et al., 2006; Scholkmann  et al., 2014 ). As fNIRS is non-invasive  
and relatively  insensitive  to motion,  it can be used to evaluate  hemody-  
namic changes  arising from neurovascular  coupling  (NVC) during a va- 
riety of cognitive  tasks in a naturalistic  environment  ( Pinti et al., 2017; 
Udina et al., 2020 ). NVC refers to the localised  increase  in blood ﬂow 
that occurs in response  to a cognitive  stimulus,  and is commonly  used 
as a surrogate  for neuronal  activity.  
In this work, we assessed  fNIRS-based  measures  of brain activity  
in older adults during the Stroop color-word  task, which is a well- 
established  method  for evaluating  executive  function,  speciﬁcally  in 
the ability to inhibit automatic  responses  ( Scarpina  and Tagini, 2017; 
Stroop,  1935; Vendrell  et al., 1995 ). The degree of Stroop interference  
(both in terms of response  time and the number  of errors made) not only 
increases  as a function  of normal  ageing ( Davidson  et al., 2003 ), but is 
exacerbated  by conditions  such as cognitive  impairment  and dementia  
( Amieva  et al., 2004; Laguë-Beauvais  et al., 2013; Spieler et al., 1996 ). 
Here, we use the presence  of ultrasound-diagnosed  bilateral  carotid 
plaques  as an indicator  of moderately  severe atherosclerotic  burden,  and 
assess whether  there are any diﬀerences  in performance,  hemodynam-  
ics, and/or brain activation  patterns  in atherosclerotic  individuals  com- 
pared with age-matched  controls.  We hypothesize  that atherosclerotic  
individuals  will perform  signiﬁcantly  worse than the healthy  controls  
on the Stroop task in terms of both time to complete  the task and the 
number  of errors made. NVC is identiﬁed  in regions  where there is a 
concurrent  increase  in O2Hb concentration  and decrease  in HHB con- 
centration.  We aim to compare  fNIRS-measures  of changes  in O2Hb and 
HHB between  groups between  corresponding  anatomical  brain regions  
to determine  the strength  and location  of NVC. We hypothesize  that the 
presence  of bilateral  carotid plaques  will be associated  with a signiﬁcant  
reduction  in NVC primarily  in the prefrontal  cortices  when comparing  
the incongruous  with the nominal  Stroop test. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Participant  recruitment  
Participants  were selected  from 184 participants  (aged 72 - 73) who 
attended  an Insight 46 clinic between  October  2018 - March 2020. Re- search Ethics Committees  in England  and Scotland  provided  approval  
for NSHD ( Hardy et al., 2016; Kuh et al., 2011; 2016; Lane et al., 2017 ). 
The National  Research  Ethics Service  Committee  London  (REC refer- 
ence 14/LO/1173)  approved  the Insight 46 sub-study.  All participants  
provided  written  informed  consent  to participate  and for their data to 
be stored. Exclusion  criteria  for the study included:  a Mini-Mental  State 
Exam (MMSE)  below 24, established  cardiovascular  disease  at age 53, 
heart attack by the age of 69. 
2.2. Investigations  
The Insight 46 protocols  have been previously  described  
( Mason et al., 2020 ). All participants  completed  a health and lifestyle  
questionnaire  and underwent  measurements  of height and weight,  
blood pressure,  and blood tests. Cholesterol/high  density  lipoprotein  
(HDL) ratio was calculated  for each participant  from the most recently  
available  data from the NSHD database.  The MMSE score from each par- 
ticipant  was also obtained  from the most recently  available  data from 
the NHSD database  to conﬁrm  that participants  had normal  cognitive  
function.  An EPIQ 7G ultrasound  scanner  (Philips  Healthcare,  Andover  
MA, USA) with a linear array transducer  (L12-3)  was used to check for 
the presence  of plaques  in the left and right carotid arteries.  A plaque 
was deﬁned  as a focal structure  that encroaches  into the arterial  lumen 
by at least 0.5 mm or 50% of the surrounding  intima-media  thickness  
or a region of intima-media  thickness  > 1.5 mm ( Touboul  et al., 2012 ). 
Echocardiography  was performed  using an EPIQ 7G ultrasound  scan- 
ner with an X5-1 transducer.  A 3-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG) was 
recorded  concurrently  with all ultrasound  examinations.  In addition,  
a standard  12-lead  resting ECG was performed  in the supine position.  
All abnormal  ﬁndings  (presence  of carotid plaques,  dilated atria, atrial 
ﬁbrillation,  left bundle branch block, aortic valve calciﬁcation,  left 
ventricular  hypertrophy,  low voltage  QRS etc.) were recorded  in the 
electronic  case report form. 
Findings  on vascular  ultrasound,  echocardiography,  and 12-lead  
electrocardiography  (ECG) were used to categorize  the study partici-  
pants based on their cardiovascular  health at the time of their second 
Insight 46 clinic visit. Participants  were tagged with at least one label as 
shown in Table 1 depending  on the number  and type of incidental  ﬁnd- 
ings from the cardiovascular  assessment.  Participants  with label 0 (no 
incidental  ﬁndings)  were classiﬁed  as ‘Healthy’  and participants  with 
label 3 (more severe atherosclerosis,  with plaque detected  on both the 
left and right carotid artery) were categorized  into the ‘Plaque’  group. 
Note that participants  with unilateral  plaques  were excluded  from fur- 
ther analysis.

3.6. Benchmarks  
To have a comprehensive  understanding  of the challenges  in the 
EEG-based  biometrics  competition,  we divided  the benchmark  test into 
three levels. 
(1) Oﬄine  evaluation  aims to reveal the challenge  of the compe-  
tition with the increasing  population  size and cross-session,  and 
cross-task;  
(2) Mock online test aims to evaluate  the performances  of diﬀerent  
baseline  models without  information  leakage.  
(3) Online  submission  provides  an example  code and the baseline  
score in the public. 
3.6.1. Oﬄine evaluation  
For oﬄine evaluation,  three analyses  were performed  to show the 
challenge  of the increasing  population  sizes, cross-session,  and cross- 
task tests in this EEG-based  biometrics  competition.  These analyses  were

performed  on the data from 20 subjects  in the calibration  set and enroll- 
ment set, whose subject ID of the second session was known.  To avoid 
any possible  information  leakage,  all the analyses  were limited to these 
20 subjects,  not any data and label information  from the testing set has 
been used. The intruder  was not considered.  The train/test  pipeline  and 
performance  metric for these analyses  were detailed  as follows:  (1) Testing  on increasing  population  sizes: To evaluate  the inﬂu- 
ence of increasing  population  sizes on the performance  of EEG- 
based biometrics,  we performed  a within-task  and cross-session  
testing the number  of subjects  was increased  from 2 to 20 with 
the step of 2 subjects.  To avoid training  bias, subjects  were ran- 
domly selected  10 times for each number  of subjects.  The epochs

11 intruders).  
from diﬀerent  EEG tasks were used for the testing separately.  For 
each task, the data from the ﬁrst session was used to train, and 
the data from the second session was used to test. 
(2) Testing  across tasks: To compare  the performance  between  
within and cross tasks, we performed  cross-session  testing with 
a population  size of 20. EEG data of a particular  task from one 
session (session  1/session  2) was used to train the model, and 
EEG data of another  task from the other session (session  2/ses- 
sion 1) was used to test. And then the training  set and the testing 
set would be exchanged  Since AEP, SEP and VEP are in the same 
runs, we treated them as one condition/task,  EP (i.e., Evoked  Po- 
tential).  Also, the term ME (Motor execution)  was used to repre- 
sent the LH, RH, and RF conditions.  
(3) Testing  across sessions:  To compare  the performance  between  
within and cross sessions,  we performed  the within-task  test with 
a population  size of 20. To make a fair comparison  of the perfor- 
mance between  within-session  and cross-session  tests, the train- 
ing set was the ﬁrst half of the epochs in the ﬁrst session,  which 
was the same for the within-session  tests and cross-session  tests. 
For the within-session  test, the testing set was the second half 
of the epochs in the ﬁrst session.  For the cross-session  tests, the 
testing set was all epochs from the second session.  
In the oﬄine evaluation,  𝐴𝑐 𝑐 was adopted  as the performance  met- 
ric of the identiﬁcation  task, which is the larger the better, and 𝐸 𝐸 𝑅 
was used for the veriﬁcation  task, which is the smaller  the better 
( Maiorana,  2021b ; Bidgoly  et al., 2022 ; Kang et al., 2018 ). 
3.6.2. Mock online test 
To evaluate  the performances  of diﬀerent  models without  any infor- 
mation leakage  from the testing set, mock online test was performed  on 
the 20 subjects  in the true calibration  set and enrollment  set. Similar  to 
the dataset composition  of the online competition,  we divided  these 20 
subjects  into the mock enrollment  set, calibration  set, and testing set. 
• The mock enrollment  training  set consisted  of epochs from the ﬁrst 
sessions  of the ﬁrst 18 subjects  (Sub001  - Sub018).  
• The mock calibration  set consisted  of epochs from the ﬁrst sessions  
of the ﬁrst 10 subjects  (Sub001  - Sub010).  
• The mock testing set consisted  of epochs from the second session of 
another  10 subjects  (Sub011-  Sub020),  in which Sub019  and Sub020  
were set as intruders.  The epochs from the ﬁrst session of Sub019  and 
Sub020  were not used. For mock online test, the performance  metrics,  Accuracy  ( 𝐴𝑐 𝑐 ), 
𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  , 𝑆 𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦  , 𝑆 𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦  , 𝐹 1 − 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 . 𝑇 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 , 𝑇 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 and the ﬁnal 
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 were applied  for both identiﬁcation  and veriﬁcation  tasks. As is 
shown in Fig. 6 , 𝐴𝑐 𝑐 , 𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 , 𝑆 𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦  , 𝑆 𝑝𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑖𝑡𝑦 , and 𝐹 1 − 𝑠𝑐 𝑜𝑟𝑒 
were adopted  to comprehensively  evaluate  the prediction  result, which 
is the larger the better. 𝑇 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and 𝑇 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 were the evaluation  of the time 
consumption  for training  and testing,  which is the smaller  the better. 
More speciﬁcally,  𝑇 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 represents  the training  time of the classiﬁer  by 
the epochs from Sub11-Sub18  in the ﬁrst session.  𝑇 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 represents  the 
testing for all epochs of Sub11-Sub20  in the second session.  Finally,  the 
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 is the overall accuracy  considering  both tasks, which decides  the 
ranking  of diﬀerent  baseline  models in the mock online test, the larger 
the better.

Fig. 1. Bundle-o-graphy  workﬂow.  Given an input tractogram  the ﬁrst step aims to reduce the number of streamlines  needed to represent  pathways  between  pairs 
of regions. Additionally,  each streamline  is parameterized  using a subset of the initial points to approximate  their trajectory.  The second step is characterized  by 
the shift from streamline  to bundle-based  representation.  Here a volume is assigned  to each streamline,  allowing  to mimic the contribution  of a set of aligned ﬁbers 
centered  around the original trajectory.  Finally the bundle-based  conﬁguration  is optimized  by adapting  their shape and geometry  following  a MCMC optimization  
approach.  
tify the optimal  subset of streamlines  from a pre-computed  set of can- 
didates,  constructed  using standard  tractography  algorithms,  that are 
most compatible  with the measured  DW-MRI  data; for this reason,  they 
are sometimes  referred  to as ﬁltering  methods  ( Daducci  et al., 2016 ). 
Diﬀerent  formulations  exist; for instance,  in SIFT/SIFT2  ( Smith et al., 
2013; 2015 ) streamlines  are selected  based on the agreement  between  
their trajectories  and the local ﬁber orientation  distributions,  whereas  
the full measured  DW-MRI  data is considered  in COMMIT/COMMIT2  
and LiFE ( Daducci  et al., 2015; Pestilli et al., 2014; Schiavi  et al., 2020 ). 
These discriminative  methods  allowed  reducing  the computational  cost 
required  to perform  global tractography  dramatically,  and showed  great 
potential  to further improve  the quality of the reconstructions,  notably  
alleviating  the problem  of false positives  as well as improving  the bio- 
logical interpretability  of the tractograms  ( Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg,  
2011; Schiavi  et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020 ). However,  unlike gen- 
erative methods,  they assume  a static input conﬁguration,  i.e. shape / 
position  of the candidate  streamlines  is ﬁxed and cannot be modiﬁed,  
which means that the quality of the reconstructions  remains  indissol-  
ubly bounded  to the quality of the algorithm  used to build the candidate  
pathways.  
In this work, we present  a hybrid method  which allows inheriting  
the strengths  of both generative  and discriminative  approaches.  Our so- 
lution tackles tractography  reconstruction  from a diﬀerent  perspective:  
the idea is to move away from streamline-based  tracking  with the aim to 
directly  reconstruct  bundles  of them; for this reason we call it bundle-o-  
graphy . Thanks  to a convenient  parameterization,  we can model groups 
of coherent  streamlines  using a minimal  set of parameters  which, in 
turn, allows us to extend a state-of-the-art  discriminative  method,  i.e. 
COMMIT  ( Daducci  et al., 2015 ), with the possibility  of eﬃciently  adapt- 
ing the conﬁguration  of the bundles  as in generative  approaches.  Our 
experiments  conducted  both on synthetic  and real data clearly indicate  
the potential  of our solution  for improving  the anatomical  accuracy  of 
the reconstructions.  
2. Methods  
The general  structure  of the algorithm  is presented  in Fig. 1 
and the general  workﬂow  takes inspiration  from our previous  
work ( Battocchio  et al., 2021 ). Bundle-o-graphy  takes as input a trac- 
togram  that can be the computed  using any tractography  algorithm,  or it 
can be the combination  of diﬀerent  reconstructions.  As ﬁrst step, we di- 
vide the input tractogram  based on a GM parcellation.  Each connection  
is then clustered  to reduce the number  of streamlines  by keeping  only 
the most representative  ones, which are parameterized  using splines.  As 
second step, the resulting  ﬁbers are used as prior to represent  fascicles  of coherent  streamlines  aligned  along each pathway,  hence introducing  
the concept  of bundle-based  representation.  The set of bundles  consti- 
tutes the conﬁguration  to optimize  using an MCMC iterative  approach,  
that allows to adapt their shape and extent along with the possibility  to 
add and remove  entire connections.  The conﬁguration  is globally  eval- 
uated and the process  is driven by a Bayesian  framework  to ﬁnd the 
optimal  conﬁguration  that best explains  the observed  signal. 
In the following,  we provide  more details about each stage of the 
algorithm.  
2.1. Streamline  reduction  and simpliﬁcation  
Streamline  reduction  is performed  based on hierarchical  clustering,  
following  the approach  implemented  by Schiavi  et al. (2020) . We ﬁrst 
divide the streamlines  with respect to anatomical  information,  in par- 
ticular based on the regions  they connect  given a cortical  and sub- 
cortical  brain parcellation  ( Fig. 2 A). Secondly,  each group of stream-  
lines is clustered  based on geometrical  criterion,  in our case represented  
by their average  euclidean  distance.  To this aim, we exploit QuickBun-  
dle ( Garyfallidis  et al., 2012 ) ( Fig. 2 B) to reduce the number  of stream-  
lines needed  to represent  connections  between  regions.  The clustering  
threshold  can be manually  chosen by the user and for our tests, we set it 
to 3 mm. Thanks  to this procedure  we can simplify  the bundle represen-  
tation and reduce the tractogram  complexity.  In particular,  by removing  
unwanted  redundancy  we are able to downsize  the input tractogram  us- 
ing, on average,  only the 2% of the initial set of streamlines.  
The resulting  streamlines  are then simpliﬁed  to minimize  the num- 
ber of parameters  needed  to represent  each trajectory,  as in the work 
of Lemkaddem  et al. (2014) , using the Douglas-Peucker  reduction  algo- 
rithm ( Douglas  and Peucker,  1973 ), which selects the minimal  subset 
of coordinates  given an approximation  threshold  ( Fig. 2 C). We reduce 
the number  of coordinates  to represent  each streamline  using between  
4 and 6 control points, in line with previous  works ( Jbabdi et al., 2007; 
Lemkaddem  et al., 2014 ). The set of points is then interpolated  using 
a particular  class of cubic B-splines,  named Catmull-Rom  ( Catmull  and 
Rom, 1974 )( Fig. 2 D), characterized  by several desirable  properties.  First 
of all, they preserve  the starting  and ending points, i.e. the ﬁrst and last 
points remain the original  ones, meaning  that the original  connectivity  is 
preserved  giving the fact that the reduced  streamlines  connect  the same 
regions.  Secondly,  the interpolated  trajectories  intersect  all the control 
points, which permits  a better supervision  of their spatial position  and 
to avoid the reconstruction  of pathways  outside  white matter regions.

Fig. 2. Streamline  reduction  workﬂow:  the ﬁrst step implies separating  the input tractogram  into subsets based on a cortical and subcortical  regions segmentation.  
Fig. 2 A is an example  showing  a set of projection  ﬁbers segmented  based on Freesurfer  atlas. Each connection  is than clustered  ( Fig. 2 B) keeping only the representative  
streamlines  for each cluster. These are simpliﬁed  using Ramer-Douglas-Peucker  algorithm  ( Fig. 2 C) which reduces the number of points needed to approximate  the 
streamline  trajectories.  Finally these coordinates  are interpolated  using cubic b-splines  ( Fig. 2 D). 
2.2. Bundle representation  
Once the input tractogram  has been reduced  and simpliﬁed,  we as- 
sign a volume  to each streamline  by exploiting  a feature embedded  in 
COMMIT.  In particular,  each tract is considered  as the centroid  of a 
cylinder,  with constant  radius, extending  along the whole trajectory.  
Following  COMMIT  formulation,  the signal contribution  of a streamline  
can be computed  based on the trajectory,  i.e the voxel it traverses,  and 
the response  function  adopted.  To extend the contribution  of a stream-  
line to the neighbor  voxels we create a set of replicas  displaced  equidis-  
tantly over concentric  circles of increasing  radius centered  around each 
point of the ﬁber. These are computed  internally,  meaning  that no fur- 
ther streamlines  are added to the conﬁguration.  Starting  in correspon-  
dence of the initial point, all circles lie on a plane that is always or- 
thogonal  to the streamline  direction.  Each point of the replicas  is then 
computed  based on Frenet-Serret  frames ( Frenet, 1852; Serret, 1851 ) 
which allows to compute  the displacement  of the replicas’  following  
points along the streamline  trajectory.  The circles discretization,  i.e., 
the number  of replicas  created,  and the number  of circles used to sample 
the space are empirically  ﬁxed. The signal contribution  corresponding  
to the bundle is computed  considering  all the voxels traversed  by the 
centroid  and its replicas.  While the signal contribution  is constant  along 
the trajectory,  it can vary as we move outward  from the center to take 
care of uncertainty  at the boundaries  of the bundle.  To do so we imple- 
mented  a blurring  function  , used to radially  scale the signal contribution,  
shown in Fig. 3 and deﬁned  as follows:  
𝑃 ( 𝑥 ) = ⎧ 
⎪ 
⎨ 
⎪ ⎩ 1 if 𝑥 < 𝜎𝐶 , 
exp ( 
− ( 𝑥 − 𝜎𝐶 ) 2 
2 𝜎2 
𝐺 ) 
otherwise.  (1) 
Based on Eq. 1 , the signal contribution  of the bundle core, which 
extent is modulated  by the parameter  𝜎𝐶 , is not scaled, while the signal 
corresponding  to the replicas  falling farther is exponentially  reduced  
depending  on the distance  𝑥 from the center according  to a Gaussian  
damping  function  regulated  by 𝜎𝐺 . A more detailed  description  of the 
bundle creation  process  can be found in Daducci  et al. (2021) . Following  this implementation,  bundle simulation  turns into modeling  the space 
of inﬂuence  of a streamline  which requires  only the parameter  𝜎𝐶 while 
𝜎𝐺 is empirically  ﬁxed.

lated to the human brain. As the tail of the axon radii distribution  may 
vary between  humans  and other mammals  ( Biedenbach  et al., 1986; Lee- 
nen et al., 1982 ), 𝑟 eﬀfor humans  may be shifted with respect to other 
species.  This shift may be further reinforced  by the reduced  capability  
to resolve small axons in human MRI systems  when compared  to pre- 
clinical  MRI systems  ( Drobnjak  et al., 2016; Nilsson  et al., 2017; Veraart  
et al., 2020 ). For human brain, the current  gold standard  for the vali- 
dation of 𝑟 eﬀ( Alexander  et al., 2010; Horowitz  et al., 2015; Innocenti  
et al., 2015; Veraart  et al., 2020 ) stems from neuroanatomical  studies ( Aboitiz  et al., 1992; Caminiti  et al., 2009; Graf von Keyserlingk  and 
Schramm,  1984; Liewald  et al., 2014 ) of small ensembles  of axons (100- 
1000 axons),  aiming to evaluate  the arithmetic  mean radius ( 𝑟 arith ) on 
manually  annotated  electron  microscopy  images (EM). As 𝑟 arith is deter- 
mined by the bulk of the axon radii distribution,  it can be expected  that 
estimates  of 𝑟 arith are less sensitive  to the ensemble  size as compared  to 
𝑟 eﬀ. For 𝑟 eﬀ, however,  small-ensemble  estimates  can strongly  under- or 
overestimate  𝑟 eﬀ( Mordhorst  et al., 2021 ) of typical MRI voxels, because  
the tail of the axon radii distribution  is insuﬃciently  sampled.  
Albeit high-resolution,  large-scale  light microscopy  (lsLM) cannot re- 
solve small axons as accurately  as EM, an lsLM-based  approach  might be 
appropriate  to generate  a histological  gold standard  for the validation  
of MRI-based  radius estimation  in human brain tissue. Because  of the 
large ﬁeld-of-view  of lsLM, covering  cross-sections  of 1 mm 2 or larger, 
it is possible  to capture  large ensembles  of axons including  10 5 to 10 6 
axons per section and thus sample the tail of the axon radii distribu-  
tion more accurately.  Moreover,  lsLM has the advantage  of being fast, 
cheap and simple to perform  compared  to EM. As the assessment  of 
axon radii on large ﬁeld-of-view  microscopy  data renders  manual  anno- 
tation infeasible,  automated  approaches,  e.g., methods  based on convo- 
lutional  neural networks  (CNN), are required.  So far, CNN-based  meth- 
ods based on large two- or three dimensional  scanning  or transmission  
electron  microscopy  (SEM/TEM)  sections  have been trained  on images 
of perfusion-ﬁxed  mice or rats ( Abdollahzadeh  et al., 2021; Zaimi et al., 
2018 ). However,  it is unlikely  that the models generated  in these studies 
translate  well to immersion-ﬁxed  human brain tissue with higher tissue 
degradation.  
In this study, we investigate  the potential  of lsLM and CNN-based  
segmentation  to map the distribution  of axon radii in a human corpus 
callosum  specimen.  We quantify  the capability  of the proposed  method  
to estimate  the MRI-visible  𝑟 eﬀand 𝑟 arith , which is commonly  reported  
in neuroanatomical  studies,  by evaluating  the estimation  errors on six 
lsLM sections.  While reference  data for the frequency-weighted  𝑟 arith 
can be generated  through  manual  annotation  with reasonable  eﬀort, 
the tail-weighting  of 𝑟 eﬀintroduces  the necessity  to accurately  capture  
the tail of the axon radii distribution  and thus investigate  larger ensem- 
bles of axons than can be realistically  annotated.  To address  this chal- 
lenge, we merge manually  annotated  radii from diﬀerent  sources  into 
composite  axon radii distributions,  combining  the accurate  resolution  of 
the bulk of axon radii in EM with representative  sampling  of the tail of 
the axon radii distribution  on large-ﬁeld-of-view  lsLM subsections.  Ad- 
ditionally,  we investigate  whether  our method  is capable  of capturing  
anatomy-related,  spatial variation  of 𝑟 arith and 𝑟 eﬀin the presence  of low- 
frequency  image intensity  variation,  e.g., due to staining  heterogeneity.  
Finally,  we analyze  the potential  error due to individual,  outstandingly  
large axons in 𝑟 eﬀ. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Ensemble  mean axon radii 
For a discrete  axon radii distribution  of 𝐵individual  radii with 𝑛 ( 𝑘 ) 
axons with radius 𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) in bin 𝑘 , the arithmetic  mean radius can be deﬁned  
as 
𝑟 arith = 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 𝑤 arith , ( 𝑘 ) ⋅𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) 
𝑤 arith , ( 𝑘 ) = 𝑛 ( 𝑘 ) 
𝐵 (1) 
The MRI-visible,  eﬀective  mean radius ( 𝑟 eﬀ) ( Burcaw  et al., 2015; 
Sepehrband  et al., 2016; Veraart  et al., 2020 ) can be estimated  from the 
intra-axonal  signal of dMRI. Clinical  acquisition  employs  pulse-gradient  
spin echo dMRI sequences  with wide pulses, i.e. using pulse widths 
2  L. Mordhorst,  M. Morozova,  S. Papazoglou  et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118906

𝑟 eﬀ= 4 √ √ √ √ 𝐾 ∑

𝐵 ⋅𝑟 5 
( 𝑘 )

𝐵 ∑𝐾 
𝑗=1 𝑛 ( 𝑗 ) 𝑟 2 
( 𝑗 ) . (2) 
While 𝑟 arith is frequency-weighted  ( 𝑤 arith , ( 𝑘 ) ) and therefore  determined  
by the bulk of the axon radii distribution,  𝑟 eﬀis weighted  ( 𝑤 eﬀ, ( 𝑘 ) ) to- 
wards the tail of the axon radii distribution  because  𝑤 eﬀ, ( 𝑘 ) scales with 
the ﬁfth power of 𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) . Each radius 𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) denotes  the radius of a circular  
approximation  of the axonal body of a myelinated  axon with equivalent  
area ( West et al., 2016 ) (hereafter  denoted  as circular  equivalent).  
2.2. Axon radii ranges 
Throughout  this manuscript,  we generated  composite  axon radii dis- 
tributions  by combining  axon radii distributions  from diﬀerent  sources  
at particular  thresholds.  As a consequence,  we partitioned  the axon radii 
distribution  into three parts: 
•Large axons ( 𝑟 ≥ 1 . 6 μm ) represent  the tail of the axon radii distri- 
bution and therefore  have a strong contribution  towards  the tail - 
weighted  𝑟 eﬀ. The threshold  was chosen so that the estimated  𝑟 eﬀ
was decreased  by 50 % when axons above this threshold  were re- 
moved from the pooled axon radii ensemble  of the corpus callosum  
lsLM sections  evaluated  with a prototype  of the proposed  method.  
•Small axons ( 𝑟 < 0 . 3 μm ) are below the resolution  limit of lsLM. 
•Medium-sized  axons ( 0 . 3 μm ≤ 𝑟 < 1 . 6 μm ) constitute  the bulk of the 
axon radii distribution  together  with small axons.

2015; Parker et al., 2015; Sandiego  et al., 2015; Savli et al., 2012; 
Smart et al., 2019 ). To protect patient conﬁdentiality,  individual  par- 
ticipant  maps were averaged  within studies before being shared.  Each 
study, the associated  receptor/transporter,  tracer, number  of healthy  
participants,  age, and reference  with full methodological  details can be 
found in Table S1. In all cases, only scans from healthy  participants  
were included.  Images were acquired  using best practice  imaging  pro- 
tocols recommended  for each radioligand.  Altogether,  the images are 
an estimate  of receptor  densities  and we therefore  refer to the mea- 
sured value (i.e. binding  potential,  tracer distribution  volume)  simply 
as density.  PET images were all registered  to the MNI-ICBM  152 non- 
linear 2009 (version  c, asymmetric)  template,  then parcellated  to a par- 
cellation  with 68 and 219 cortical  regions,  as well as 15 subcortical  
regions,  according  to the Lausanne  atlas ( Cammoun  et al., 2012; De- 
sikan et al., 2006 ). Receptors  and transporters  with more than one mean 
image of the same tracer (i.e. 5-HT 1 B , D 2 , mGluR 5 , and VAChT)  were 
averaged  together  in a manner  that weights  each image by the num- 
ber of participants  in the cohort. Tracer images are highly consistent  
across cohorts  (see Fig. S1 in Hansen  et al. (2021) ). In some cases, im- 
ages of multiple  tracers for the same receptor  were available.  In these 
cases, we show the tracer with the larger number  of participants  in the 
main text, but we ﬁnd consistent  results when analyses  are repeated  
for alternative  tracers (Fig. S9). Finally,  each tracer map correspond-  
ing to each receptor/transporter  was z-scored  across regions  and con- 
catenated  into a ﬁnal region ×receptor  matrix of relative  densities.  This 
data was presented  and used originally  in Hansen  et al. (2021) and is 
available  in neuromaps  ( https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ) 
( Markello  et al., 2022 ). 
Autoradiography  data acquisition  
In vitro receptor  autoradiography  data were originally  collected  and 
processed  as described  in Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) . Fif- 
teen neurotransmitter  receptor  densities  across 44 cytoarchitectonically  
identiﬁed  areas in three post-mortem  brains were acquired  from Supple-  
mentary  Table 2 of Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) (see Table S2 
for a complete  list of receptors  included  in the autoradiography  dataset).  
Detailed  information  concerning  the standard  incubation  protocols  es- 
tablished  over the last 25 years at Julich Research  Centre and neces- 
sary for labeling  the receptors  is provided  in Supplementary  Table of 
Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) (see also Palomero-Gallagher  and 
Zilles (2018) ; Zilles et al. (2002a,b)  ). Note that GABA A and GABA A∕BZ 
refer to the same receptor,  but that GABA A∕BZ refers speciﬁcally  to 
GABA A receptors  containing  the allosteric  benzodiazepine  binding  site, 
as opposed  to receptors  containing  only the GABA neurotransmitter  
binding  site. To best compare  PET data analyses  with the autoradiogra-  
phy dataset,  a region-to-region  mapping  was manually  created  between  
the 44 available  cortical  regions  in the autoradiography  dataset and the 
34 left hemisphere  cortical  Desikan  Killiany  regions.  In only one case 
(the insula) was there no suitable  mapping  between  the autoradiogra-  
phy data and the Desikan  Killiany  atlas. As such, the 44-region  autora-  
diography  atlas was converted  to 33 Desikan  Killiany  left hemisphere  
regions.  Finally,  receptor  densities  were z-scored  and averaged  across 
laminar  layers, to create a single map of receptor  densities  across the 
cortex (for results across three laminar  layers, see Fig. S2). 
Microarray  gene expression  
Regional  microarray  expression  data were obtained  from six post- 
mortem  brains provided  by the Allen Human  Brain Atlas (AHBA;  
http://human.brain-map.org/  ) ( Hawrylycz  et al., 2012 ). Since only two of the six brains included  samples  from the right hemisphere,  main anal- 
yses were conducted  on the left hemisphere  only. All processing  was 
performed  using the abagen toolbox  ( https://github.com/netneurolab/  
abagen  ( Markello  et al., 2021 )). These data were processed  and mapped  
to parcellated  brain regions  at 34 and 111 left hemisphere  cortical  grey 
matter nodes according  to the Lausanne  anatomical  atlas ( Cammoun  
et al., 2012; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). For completeness,  data were also par- 
cellated  to 15 bilateral  subcortical  regions.  Due to the coarse subcortical  
parcellation,  suﬃcient  probes were available  for both hemispheres.  
Microarray  probes were reannotated  using data provided  by 
Arnatkevi  či ū t ėet al. (2019) . A single microarray  probe with the high- 
est diﬀerential  stability,  Δ𝑆 ( 𝑝 ) , was selected  to represent  each gene 
( Hawrylycz  et al., 2015 ), where diﬀerential  stability  was calculated  as: 
Δ𝑆 ( 𝑝 ) = 1 (𝑁 
2 )𝑁−1 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝑁 ∑
𝑗= 𝑖 +1 𝑟 [ 𝐵 𝑖 ( 𝑝 ) , 𝐵 𝑗 ( 𝑝 )] (1) 
Here, 𝑟 is Spearman’s  rank correlation  of the expression  of a single probe 
𝑝 across regions  in two donor brains, 𝐵 𝑖 and 𝐵 𝑗 , and 𝑁is the total 
number  of donor brains. Diﬀerential  stability  is the average  correlation  
across every pair of donor brains of a probe’s  expression.  This procedure  
retained  20 232 probes,  each representing  a unique gene. We repeat the 
analyses  using alternative  probe selection  methods  and ﬁnd consistent  
results (Fig. S10). 
Next, samples  were assigned  to brain regions  using MNI coor- 
dinates  generated  via non-linear  registrations  ( https://github.com/  
chrisﬁlo/alleninf ) by ﬁnding  the nearest  region, up to 2 mm away. 
To reduce the potential  for misassignment,  sample-to-region  match- 
ing was constrained  by hemisphere  and cortical/subcortical  divisions  
( Arnatkevi  či ū t ėe t al., 2019 ). If a brain region was not assigned  any 
sample based on the above procedure,  the sample closest to the cen- 
troid of that region was selected  in order to ensure that all brain regions  
were assigned  a value. 
Inter-subject  variation  was addressed  by normalizing  tissue sample 
expression  values for each donor across genes using a scaled robust sig- 
moid function  ( Fulcher  and Fornito,  2016 ): 
𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 1 
1 + exp (− ( 𝑥 𝑔 − ⟨𝑥 𝑔 ⟩) 
IQR 𝑥 ) (2) 
where ⟨𝑥 𝑔 ⟩is the median  and IQR is the normalized  interquartile  range 
of the expression  value of a single gene across regions.  Normalized  gene 
expression  values were then rescaled  to a unit interval:  
𝑥 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 = 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 − min ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) 
max ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) − min ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) (3) 
Gene expression  values were normalized  across tissue samples  using the 
same procedure.  Samples  assigned  to the same brain region were then 
averaged  separately  for each donor. Scaled regional  expression  proﬁles  
were ﬁnally averaged  across donors.  
Finally,  we repeat all analyses  using RNAseq  data collected  from 
the two donors with RNAseq  measurements  (see Fig. S1 and Fig. S3) 
( Hawrylycz  et al., 2012 ). Gene expression-receptor  density  associations  
across neurotransmitter  receptors  in both the PET and autoradiography  
datasets  remain consistent  whether  gene expression  is derived  from the

Gene-receptor  pairs 
With the notable  exception  of the GABA B receptor,  metabotropic  
neurotransmitter  receptors  are monomeric  structures,  and thus a sin- 
gle gene codes for the entire receptor.  Therefore,  the expression  of the 
receptor-coding  gene was correlated  with the density  of the receptor  
itself. The GABA B and ionotropic  receptors  are characterized  by being 
multimeric  protein  complexes,  so each receptor  was correlated  with mi- 
croarray  expression  of all possible  receptor  subunits.  Below, we outline 
each multimeric  case.

•GABA A is a pentamer  typically  composed  of three primary  subunits  
( 𝛼1 , 𝛽2 , and 𝛾2 ) but can be built out of a total of nineteen  diﬀerent  
subunits.  For simplicity,  we show results for the three primary  sub- 
units in the main text, but results for the remaining  sixteen subunits  
can be found in Fig. S12. 
•GABA B , a multimeric  metabotropic  receptor,  is composed  of two 
subunits.  We show both in the main analyses.  
•AMPA is a heterotetramer  that typically  consists  of two pairs of du- 
plicate subunits.  These two pairs can be formed  from any combina-  
tion of four subunits.  We show results for the gene whose expres-  
sion is most highly correlated  with AMPA density  in the main text 
( GRIA1 ). 
•NMDA is also a heterotetramer,  typically  composed  of two N1 and 
two N2 subunits,  although  there are four diﬀerent  N2 -encoding  
genes, as well as a third subunit  ( N3 ) for which there are two subunit-  
encoding  genes. The main analyses  use the expression  of the N1 - 
encoding  gene ( GRIN1 ). 
•Kainate  exists as both a homotetramer  and heterotetramer,  built 
from any of ﬁve subunits.  We show results for the gene whose ex- 
pression  is most highly correlated  with kainate  density  in the main 
text ( GRIK2 ). 
•𝛼4 𝛽2 is a pentamer  typically  composed  of two 𝛼4 subunits  and three 
𝛽2 subunits  ( Dani, 2015 ). However,  the ligand used for the autora-  
diograph,  epibatidin,  binds to any heteromeric  nicotinic  receptors  
that contain  both an alpha subunit  ( 𝛼2 –𝛼7 , 𝛼9 , 𝛼10 ) and a beta sub- 
unit ( 𝛽2 –𝛽4 ). The most abundant  such receptor  in the brain is the 𝛼4 𝛽2 
receptor,  so we focus on gene expression  of the 𝛼4 and 𝛽2 subunits  
( CHRNA4  and CHRNB2  , respectively)  in the main text. 
Correlations  between  neurotransmitter  receptor  density  and multiple  
subunit  expression  were corrected  for multiple  comparisons  using the 
Benjamini-Hochberg  FDR correction  ( Benjamini  and Hochberg,  1995 ). 
Correlation  coeﬃcients  and corrected  𝑝 -values (see Null model ) for all 
subunits  can be found in Table S3 (PET, cortex) Table S4 (PET, subcor-  
tex), and Table S5 (autoradiography)  as well as in stand-alone  machine-  
readable  supplementary  csv ﬁles. 
Null model 
Spatial autocorrelation-preserving  permutation  tests were used to as- 
sess statistical  signiﬁcance  of associations  across brain regions,  termed 
“spin tests ”( Alexander-Bloch  et al., 2018; Markello  and Misic, 2021 ). 
Parametric  𝑝 -values were not used because  spatially  embedded  systems  
such as the brain violate the assumption  that observations  (brain re- 
gions) are independent  from one another.  We created  a surface-based  
representation  of the parcellation  on the FreeSurfer  fsaverage  left hemi- 
sphere surface,  via ﬁles from the Connectome  Mapper  toolkit ( https: 
//github.com/LTS5/cmp  ). We used the spherical  projection  of the fsav- 
erage left hemisphere  surface to deﬁne spatial coordinates  for each par- 
cel by selecting  the coordinates  of the vertex closest to the center of 
the mass of each parcel ( Vázquez-Rodríguez  et al., 2019 ). These par- 
cel coordinates  were then randomly  rotated,  and original  parcels were 
reassigned  the value of the closest rotated  parcel (10 000 repetitions).  
Parcels for which the medial wall was closest were assigned  the value of 
the next most proximal  parcel instead.  The procedure  was performed  at 
the parcel resolution  rather than the vertex resolution  to avoid upsam-  
pling the data, and only to the left hemisphere.  In the autoradiography  
dataset,  null correlations  were computed  ignoring  the insula and regions  
resampled  to the insula, for a maximum  of three ignored  brain regions.  
All reported  𝑝 -values for expression-density  correlations  are one-tailed.  
Structural  connectivity  
Following  the procedure  described  in de Wael et al. (2018) , we 
obtained  diﬀusion  weighted  imaging  data for 326 unrelated  partic- 
ipants (age range 2235 years, 145 males) from the Human  Con- 
nectome  Project (HCP; S900 release ( Van Essen et al., 2013 )). DWI data was pre-processed  using the MRtrix3  package  ( Tournier  et al., 
2019 ) ( https://www.mrtrix.org/  ). More speciﬁcally,  ﬁber orientation  
distributions  were generated  using the multi-shell  multi-tissue  con- 
strained  spherical  deconvolution  algorithm  from MRtrix ( Dhollander  
et al., 2016; Jeurissen  et al., 2014 ). White matter edges were then re- 
constructed  using probabilistic  streamline  tractography  based on the 
generated  ﬁber orientation  distributions  ( Tournier  et al., 2010 ). The 
tract weights  were then optimized  by estimating  an appropriate  cross- 
section multiplier  for each streamline  following  the procedure  proposed  
by Smith et al. (2015) and a connectivity  matrix was built for each par- 
ticipant  using the 68-region  Deskian-Killiany  parcellation  ( Cammoun  
et al., 2012; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). Collating  each individual’s  structural  
connectome  was done using a group-consensus  approach  that seeks to 
preserve  the density  and edge-length  distributions  of the individual  con- 
nectomes  ( Betzel et al., 2019 ). The binary density  for the ﬁnal whole- 
brain structural  connectome  was 31 . 2% . Edges were weighted  by the 
average  log-transform  of non-zero  streamline  density,  scaled to values 
between  0 and 1. Detailed  information  regarding  data acquisition  and 
pre-processing  is also available  elsewhere  ( Glasser  et al., 2013; Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ).

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118987,"2. Methodological  advances  in gradient  mapping  
The remarkable  growth  in our capacity  to map local and whole- 
brain cortical  gradients  as novel ways to study both subregional  as well 
as macroscale  brain organization  has been tied to the introduction  of 
new analytic  techniques.  These include  methods  to derive gradients  
( Guell et al., 2018 ; Haak et al., 2018 ; Margulies  et al., 2016 ; Vos de 
Wael et al., 2020 ), to align them to one another  ( Benkarim  et al., 2021 ; 
Nenning  et al., 2015 , 2020 ; Vos de Wael et al., 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), to 
analyze  gradient-derived  features  ( Haak et al., 2018 ; Langs et al., 2015 ; 
Tian et al., 2020 ), and to assess their associations  to neural as well as 
non-neuronal  spatial maps ( Alexander-Bloch  et al., 2018 ). A series of pa- 
pers in this special issue provide  useful additions  to the growing  arsenal  
of gradient  analysis.  
Describing  gradients  requires  a class of techniques  that can char- 
acterize  gradual  changes  in features.  Bajada et al. (2020) introduce  
the Vogt-Bailey  (VB) index, which quantiﬁes  across the cortical  man- 
tle on how sharply  inter-areal  boundaries  are deﬁned  and released  
open tools for VB index calculation  and gradient  mapping  ( https://  
github.com/VBIndex/  ). Arguing  for potential  beneﬁts  of a gradient  per- 
spective  for functional  cartography,  Haak and Beckmann  (2020) out- 
line that gradient  models may capture  both functional  heterogeneity  
as well as functional  multiplicity  across the cortical  mantle,  and thus 
complement  arealization  approaches  that posit discrete  boundaries  and 
assume  functional  uniformity  within regions.  In Glomb et al. (2020) , 
the authors  present  a graph signal processing  framework  that, ap- 
plied to EEG data, identiﬁes  harmonic  basis functions  to compactly  
describe  neurophysiological  brain activity.  These harmonics  are or-

dered by the degree of smoothness/variation  along the cortex, lead- 
ing to a multi-scale  representation  of brain connectivity.  They demon-  
strate that the sparse harmonics  representation  with only a few com- 
ponents  can track large-scale  cortical  activity  during a face detection  
task. Dohmatob  et al. (2021) study the predictability  of task fMRI con- 
trast data from resting fMRI. They demonstrate  that the combination  of 
data from multiple  parcellations  is the best representation  of local func- 
tional gradients,  oﬀering  highest  performance  in rest-to-task  mapping.  
Using a sparse matrix factorization  algorithm  trained  on multiple,  di- 
verse fMRI datasets  Dadi et al. (2020) , Dadi and colleagues  identify  a 
novel dictionary  of ﬁne-grained  high-dimensional  functional  modes for 
fMRI representation.  
Building  on the description  of fundamental  patterns,  a major chal- 
lenge is to characterize  meaningful  population  variance.  To advance  the 
analysis  of data across multiple  individuals,  Nenning  et al. (2020) pro- 
pose a joint embedding  procedure.  Comparing  a joint embedding  ap- 
proach applied  to resting-state  fMRI data to conventional  orthonor-  
mal/Procrustes  alignment,  they demonstrate  higher discriminability  of 
individual  subjects,  higher overlap  between  resting-state  fMRI derived  
topographies  and task-fMRI  activations,  as well as an enhanced  predic- 
tion of age. Overall,  these ﬁndings  suggest  that joint embedding  may en- 
hance the study of inter-individual  diﬀerences  in a gradient  setting,  and 
thus potentially  enhance  its ability to serve as biomarkers.  In a similar 
vein, Hong et al. (2020) evaluate  strategies  to improve  the reproducibil-  
ity, reliability  and predictive  validity  of resting-state  fMRI gradients.  
Their study provides  several recommendations  to enhance  reproducibil-  
ity and reliability,  and they demonstrate  that the low-dimensional  con- 
nectivity  gradient  approaches  can outperform  conventional  edge-based  
analyses  in terms of predicting  phenotypic  scores based on the human 
connectome  dataset.  
In addition  to deriving  lower dimensional  representations  of func- 
tional or structural  data, the ﬁeld is increasingly  exploring  new for- 
mal ways to contextualize  MRI-derived  measures  with other mark- 
ers of neural architecture.  Patel et al. (2020) present  a virtual histol- 
ogy approach,  relating  diﬀerent  MRI measures  with post mortem  gene 
expression  data. They report that many MRI measures,  including  T1 
and T2 relaxation  times, T1w/T2w  ratio, MWF, MTR, FA and cortical  
thickness  reﬂect expression  proﬁles  of genes speciﬁc  to CA1 pyrami-  
dal cells; genes enriched  in processes  related to dendritic  arborization.  
In Burt et al. (2020) , the authors  present  an autocorrelation  preserv-  
ing null model and corresponding  open access software  ( https://github.  
com/murraylab/brainsmash  ), which can help to statistically  evaluate  
the correspondence  between  gradients  and other aspects  of brain or- 
ganization  while controlling  for autocorrelation.  Expanding  even fur- 
ther upon the search for correspondence  of diﬀerent  imaging  features,  
Haueis (2021) advocates  for the use of formal multi-scale  models,  which 
could provide  a mechanistic  link between  microcircuit  organization  and 
macrolevel  brain function.  
2.1. Advancing  multiscale  neuroanatomy  and structure-function  
exploration  
By oﬀering  a continuous  perspective  to assess subregional  hetero- 
geneity,  to arrange  cortical  areas along axes of whole-brain  organiza-  
tion, and to interrogate  structure-function  relationships,  gradient  map- 
ping may advance  cortical  cartography,  and thus inform and comple-  
ment established  perspectives  on cortical  arealization  ( Genon et al., 
2021 ; Eickhoﬀet  al., 2018a ). The Special Issue includes  several papers 
that provide  important  proof of principle  for the utility of continuous  
representations  in characterizing  cortical  areas and networks.  
On a whole-brain  scale, gradients  appear to map the global rela- 
tionships  between  distributed  functional  systems  as well as how spa- 
tial features  of speciﬁc  systems  map are situated  within broader  pat- 
terns of organization.  And while sensory  systems,  such as the visual and 
auditory  domains,  have long been the focus of research  into domain-  
speciﬁc  hierarchies  —o f t e n  described  as stepwise  processing  streams  —the methodologies  and frameworks  aﬀorded  by a gradient-based  per- 
spective  enable insight into other domains.  For example,  the somatosen-  
sory system demonstrates  three processing  hierarchies  extending  away 
from the central sulcus ( Saadon  Grosman  et al., 2020 ). The authors  com- 
bine tactile body stimulation  and fMRI measurements  to identify  func- 
tional gradients  in somatosensory  areas. By stratifying  response  patterns  
with respect to laterality  and selectivity,  they furthermore  show corre- 
spondence  between  gradients  and a functional  hierarchy  of somatosen-  
sory representations.  Lefco et al. (2020) examine  gradients  of fronto- 
parietal  network  organization,  combining  analysis  of visual attention  
and visual short-term  memory  fMRI tasks with resting-state  fMRI con- 
nectomics.  Their ﬁndings  reveal ﬁne-scale  gradients  in functional  con- 
nectivity  within the frontoparietal  visual network.  
Focussing  on the insula, a paralimbic  cortical  region, 
Royer et al. (2020) study microstructural  gradients  based on myelin-  
sensitive  MRI analysis.  They report dominant  axes of subregional  
microstructural  organization,  one running  in anterior-posterior  di- 
rection and one diﬀerentiating  the dorsal anterior  subdivision  from 
the remaining  insular cortex. In addition,  they show associations  
to underlying  histological  characteristics  and large-scale  functional  
network  connectivity,  suggesting  that microstructural  variations  can 
help to understand  functional  diversity  in integrative  hub regions  
such as the insula. Assessing  another  nexus in the human limbic 
system,  Kharabian  Masouleh  et al. (2020) study gradients  of structural  
covariance  in the hippocampus,  a structure  in the mesiotemporal  lobe. 
They demonstrate  a principal  gradient  running  along the hippocampal  
long axis that closely follows  its main axis of functional  diﬀerentia-  
tion, and a second gradient  that runs along dorsal ventral axes that 
reﬂects  hippocampal  microstructural  diﬀerentiation.  Also investigating  
the architecture  of paralimbic  areas, Waymel  et al. (2020) associate  
diﬀerent  functional  gradients  with meta-analytical  activations  from 
episodic  memory  and olfactory  tasks, and show that the ﬁrst, sensory-  
transmodal  functional  gradient  relates most strongly  to episodic  
memory  processing,  whereas  the ﬁfth functional  gradient  describes  
a piriform-isocortical  pattern  related most to olfaction.  The authors  
interpret  their ﬁndings  in the context  of the ‘dual origin’ theory 
( Sanides,  1962 ), which posits that cortical  evolution  emanated  along 
progressive  rings of laminar  diﬀerentiation  from origins in the piriform  
and parahippocampal  cortex. Taking a cortex-wide  perspective  on 
the interplay  between  microstructure,  connectivity,  and hierarchical  
organization,  Vezoli et al. (2021) review laminar-speciﬁc  projection  
patterns  and their association  to cortical  hierarchies.  Their ﬁndings  
provide  evidence  for a dual counter  stream architecture,  which incorpo-  
rates distance-dependent  feedback  and feedforward  pathways  through  
supra- and infragranular  layers, respectively.  
Despite  a focus of prior work on cortical  organization,  several stud- 
ies in the special issue also investigate  subcortical  structures  as well 
as white matter architecture,  which are thought  to be key aspects  to 
fully understand  whole brain organization  and dynamics  ( Shine et al., 
2019a , 2019b ). Yang et al. (2020) derived  thalamic  functional  gradients  
based on resting-state  fMRI, identifying  a ﬁrst medio-lateral  and a sec- 
ond anterior-posterior  gradient.  They furthermore  show that the ﬁrst 
gradient  reﬂects  known thalamic  subnuclear  divisions,  while the sec- 
ond gradient  was found to relate to established  associations  between  the 
thalamus  and cortical  intrinsic  functional  communities  as well as cog- 
nitive ontologies.  Also studying  thalamic  subregional  organization  and 
its link to cortex-wide  function,  Muller et al. (2020) show that diﬀerent  
neuronal  subpopulations  of the thalamus  diﬀerentially  relate to corti- 
cal gradients,  time scales, and dynamics.  They show that core neuronal  
populations  (expressing  parvalbumin)  innervate  more strongly  granular  
cortical  layers and project more closely to sensory/unimodal  regions,  
while matrix populations  (expressing  calbindin)  innervate  supragranular  
layers more diﬀusely  and correlate  more closely to higher/transmodal  
regions  with longer time scales. Cona et al. (2021) carry out a meta- 
analysis  of neuroimaging  studies that investigates  cortical  representa-  
tions for space and time. They identify  a set of distributed  regions,  in- 
3  Editorial NeuroImage  251 (2022) 118987 
cluding  insular,  pre-SMA,  opercular  and intraparietal  regions,  and ob- 
serve a gradient  of activation  values related to time vs space process-  
ing. Assessing  interactions  between  cortical  functional  organization  and 
white matter architecture,  Friedrich  et al. (2020) map the principal  
sensory-transmodal  functional  gradient  to the midsection  of the cor- 
pus callosum,  a major pathway  connecting  both cortical  hemispheres.  
Transmodal  gradient  values are found to be represented  on the genu, 
the anterior  part of the callosum,  while sensory  and motor regions  are 
represented  more posteriorly,  suggesting  a potentially  mirrored  topog- 
raphy of cortical  function  and inter-hemispheric  structural  connectivity.  
2.2. A coordinate  system to understand  brain dynamics  and cognitive  
hierarchies  
The challenge  of linking features  of brain organization  across scales 
is crucial for a mechanistic  account  of brain dynamics  and their relation  
to behavior.  Following  up on initial ﬁndings  that the functional  as well 
as microstructural  gradients  ( Paquola  et al., 2019b ; Huntenburg  et al., 
2017 ) may tap into primate  cortical  hierarchies  ( Mesulam,  1998 ) and 
time-varying  neural architecture  ( Chaudhuri  et al., 2015 ; Gao et al., 
2020 ), several studies in the Special Issue examine  the continuous  fea- 
tures underlying  functional  dynamics  and cognitive  hierarchies.  
Youseﬁ and  Keilholz  (2021) utilize dynamic  rs-fMRI  analysis  
to demonstrate  how intrinsic  functional  activity  propagates  along 
macroscale  functional  gradients,  suggesting  that these axes may play 
a role in constraining  functional  dynamics.  Park et al. (2021c ) derive 
cortex-wide  structural  connectivity  gradients  from diﬀusion  MRI trac- 
tography,  and show associations  to dynamic  functional  transitions  es- 
timated  from resting-state  fMRI via hidden Markov  models.  Notably,  
structural  gradient  information  helps explaining  transitions  between  
sensorimotor  states and between  sensorimotor  and transmodal  states, 
but not between  transmodal  states. Also aiming at predicting  functional  
dynamics  from neurostructural  features,  Liu et al. (2020) conduct  a 
transcriptome-connectome  association  study. Leveraging  a multivariate  
approach,  the authors  show that transcriptional  proﬁles  explain  approx-  
imately  28% of the variation  in this spatial layout of functional  net- 
work dynamics.  Mitra et al. (2020) propose  a framework  for computing  
probabilistic  ﬂow in brain activity  and demonstrate  how ﬂow probabil-  
ities change across rest as well as task states. They furthermore  demon-  
strate that their probabilistic  perspective  captures  both intra- and inter- 
network  dynamics.  
In addition  to the emerging  consensus  that gradients  may represent  
important  patterns  of intrinsic  brain organization,  it remains  to be in- 
vestigated  how far these patterns  constrain  state-to-state  variation  in 
brain function.  In several studies,  the axes described  by functional  gra- 
dients are used to describe  task-evoked  patterns  of activations  and de- 
activations.  Investigating  the link between  intrinsic  neural function  and 
task-evoked  activity,  Ito et al. (2020) show that across multiple  tasks, 
the magnitude  of regional  task-evoked  activity  is high in unimodal  ar- 
eas, but low in transmodal  areas. In contrast,  task-state  functional  con- 
nectivity  is signiﬁcantly  reduced  in unimodal  areas relative  to trans- 
modal areas. Also pointing  to hierarchy-dependent  shifts in localized  vs 
distributed  processing,  the negative  relationship  between  localized  task 
activity  and distributed  connectivity  is associated  with the principal  gra- 
dient of macroscale  function.  Viviani  et al. (2020) assess brain gradients  
of functional  activation  and deactivation  in association  cortices  during a 
social decision-making  task. The authors  identify  two distinct  networks  
were diﬀerentially  recruited,  depending  on whether  the social decision  
making  was informed  by sensory  vs contextual  cues. Notably,  these dis- 
tinct networks  are centered  at the junction  of externally-and  internally  
oriented  systems,  such as the default mode network.  Two studies from 
the same group further contribute  to the notion that the principal  func- 
tional gradient  may capture  the spatial layout of networks  implicated  in 
higher order and semantic  processing.  In Lanzoni  et al. (2020) , the au- 
thors study semantic  cue integration  using task fMRI. They observe  max- imal activation  for the convergent  cue condition  at the heteromodal  de- 
fault mode end of the principal  gradients.  These ﬁndings  suggest  that the 
default mode network  as being the apex of the sensory-transmodal  hier- 
archy supports  states of information  integration  that constrain  ongoing  
cognition.  Wang et al. (2020) contextualize  task-fMRI  patterns  during a 
semantic  judgment  task and demonstrate  the strongest  response  when 
input overlapped  with long-term  memory,  particularly  at the transmodal  
apex. These ﬁndings  furthermore  provide  support  that the cortical  hi- 
erarchy  captured  by the principal  functional  gradient  may serve as an 
organizational  axis of controlled  semantic  cognition.  
Given the ability to characterize  ongoing  function,  a further 
step is to investigate  associations  with complex  internal  states. 
McKeown  et al. (2020) combine  experience  sampling  techniques  with 
resting-state  fMRI connectivity  gradient  analyses  and show inter- 
individual  diﬀerences  in patterns  of ongoing  thought  related to subtle 
shifts in macroscale  gradient  organization  during wakeful  rest. Looking  
at state-dependent  functional  changes,  Cross et al. (2021) assess func- 
tional connectivity  gradients  derived  from fMRI measures  during cogni- 
tive tasks in individuals  after either a normal  night of sleep, after 24 h 
of sleep deprivation,  or after a morning  recovery  nap. Despite  ﬁnding  
evidence  for state-dependent  changes  in overall functional  connectivity  
strength,  the authors  identify  relatively  consistent  functional  gradients,  
suggesting  that main axes of functional  organization  may be relatively  
preserved  across diﬀerent  vigilance  states.

tation of brain anatomy  and an accurate  diﬀerentiation  between  corti- 
cal, subcortical,  and deep structures,  they are used in combination  with 
functional  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (fMRI) and Diﬀusion-Weighted  
Imaging  (DWI) acquisitions,  as reference  for the visualization  of cerebral  
functional  and structural  connectivity  ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ). 
In the pervasive  use of T1-weighted  images in neuroscience  a recur- 
rent requirement  is the segmentation  of the diﬀerent  tissues ( Balafar 
et al., 2010; Despotovi  et al., 2015; Yushkevich  et al., 2006 ), usually  
after removal  of the skull. The selection  of the target tissues may be 
dependent  on the purpose.  One of the most common  choice concerns  6 
tissues ( Avants et al., 2015; Kuklisova-Murgasova  et al., 2011; Orasanu  
et al., 2016; Weiss et al., 2021 ): cerebrospinal  ﬂuid, white matter,  cor- 
tical gray matter,  deep gray matter,  cerebellum  and brainstem.  The ac- 
curacy of segmentation  for white and gray matter is the most crucial for 
structural  and functional  brain connectivity  studies in neuroscience.  
Manual  segmentation  of the human brain tissues is usually  carried 
out by an expert, often a radiologist  or a specialized  clinician.  The pro- 
cess requires  detecting  the anatomical  structures  in the data and labeling  
them according  to a predeﬁned  set of target tissues.  The task is generally  
performed  by operating  slice by slice on 2D images despite the source 
images being volumes.  
Manual  brain tissue segmentation  is quite common  in clinical  prac- 
tice and can be considered  as the gold standard  ( Morey et al., 2009 ). 
Nevertheless,  there are several drawbacks  ( Heye et al., 2013 ). First of 
all this activity  is extremely  time consuming  and, even worse, involves  
the costly time of experts  ( Balafar et al., 2010; Despotovi  et al., 2015 ). 
Long sessions  of segmentation  increase  the intra operator  variability  and 
the probability  of error. An additional  source of variability  is the bias of 
the single operator  that may produce  large diﬀerences  in the outcome  
( Cherbuin  et al., 2009 ). 
On the other hand, automated  methods  for tissue segmentation  pro- 
vide more consistent  and reproducible  results even though not neces- 
sarily accurate.  Diﬀerently  from the manual  approach  where error is 
more incidental,  with automated  methods,  we may have systematic  er- 
rors. There are several tools for automated  tissue segmentation  widely 
adopted  by the scientiﬁc  community  such as FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ), SPM ( Ashburner  and Friston,  2000 ), FreeSurfer  ( Dale et al., 
1999 ), ANTs ( Tustison  et al., 2013 ). They don’t require  user interaction  
but rely on anatomical  priors of the human brain tissues.  This is the rea- son why their performance  is quite accurate  on healthy  individuals  with 
normal  and preserved  brain anatomy.  
However,  the meaningful  role of anatomical  priors in tools for au- 
tomated  tissue segmentation  is one of the reasons  for their lower ac- 
curacy in clinical  practice,  speciﬁcally  in the case of severe lesions or 
highly distorted  cerebral  anatomy.  This is, for example,  the case of Age- 
nesis of Corpus Callosum  (ACC), among the most common  brain malfor-  
mations.  In these patients,  the absence  of the corpus callosum  (a thick 
WM structure  that represents  the largest commissural  tract between  the 
two cerebral  hemispheres)  causes an important  reorganization  of the 
brain with peculiar  anatomical  features  (colpocephaly,  deep interhemi-  
spheric  ﬁssure,  abnormal  morphology  of the hippocampi,  presence  of 
Probst bundles  along the mesial surface of the brain, absence  of cin- 
gulum gyri etc.). Other examples  are malformations  of cortical  devel- 
opment  (MCDs),  where the regular  pattern  of cortical  gyriﬁcation  and 
sulcation  is focally or diﬀusely  altered.  The patterns  may be extremely  
variable,  from cases of high or complete  reduction  of the number  of gyri 
(pachygyria  and lissencephaly)  to cases of increased  and tiny, small gyri 
(polymicrogyria).  
Moreover,  brain tissue segmentation  may be even harder in children  
and young adults. In these cases, in addition  to modiﬁcations  of brain 
anatomy  induced  by congenital  malformations  or acquired  conditions  
(e.g. severe hydrocephalus,  encephalomalacia  or pre and postnatal  brain 
insults),  the normal  growth  of the brain and the modiﬁcation  of the MRI 
signal of the diﬀerent  tissues (e.g. the increase  of fat related to myeli- 
nation and the decrease  of water content)  make the task more complex.  
For this reason,  we focus our attention  on T1-weighted  images drawn 
from a paediatric  population,  where individual  ages are up to 21 years 
( Hardin et al., 2017 ). 
The heterogeneity  of brain distortions  is a source of complexity  for 
a model-based  approach  to tissue segmentation.  The task might become  
even more diﬃcult  because  of the occurrence  of several distortions  at 
the same time. In addition,  there is a lack of literature  on tissue segmen-  
tation in the presence  of meaningful  alteration  of brain structure  ( Roy 
et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2019 ). 
Automated  methods  to tissue segmentation  are not limited to model- 
based approaches  despite the fact that the most common  tools are driven 
by anatomical  priors of brain structure  ( Dale et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 
2001; Ashburner  and Friston,  2005; Tustison  et al., 2013; Tustison  et al., 
2  G. Amorosino,  D. Peruzzo, D. Redaelli et al. NeuroImage  260 (2022) 119486 
2014; Puonti et al., 2016 ). Recently  there has been a growing  eﬀort to 
investigate  a data-driven  approach.  The cast of tissue segmentation  as a 
supervised  learning  problem  is quite straightforward,  and the evolution  
of the deep learning  techniques  is providing  promising  and eﬀective  
results ( Ito et al., 2019b; Khalili et al., 2019; Weiss et al., 2021; Zhang 
et al., 2021 ). 
Nevertheless,  the applications  of deep learning  are not addressing  
the speciﬁc  cases of distorted  brains because  the acquisition  of a large 
collection  of annotated  examples  becomes  a tough constraint.  Lately, 
an interesting  investigation  has been carried out by training  a convo- 
lutional  learning  model on a sample of healthy  individuals  and subse- 
quently  operating  the inference  of tissue segmentation  a on few brains 
with malformations  ( Amorosino  et al., 2020 ). The empirical  results are 
really promising.  The intuitive  idea is to not limit the segmentation  of 
tissues by their structure  expectation  but also to exploit the information  
encoded  in the signal intensity  of T1-weighted  images.  
Our contribution  is a benchmark  to support  an open investigation  
on how the tissue segmentation  of distorted  brains can be improved  by 
adopting  a supervised  learning  approach.  We formulate  a precise deﬁni- 
tion of the task and propose  an evaluation  metric for a fair and quantita-  
tive comparison.  The training  sample is composed  of almost one thou- 
sand healthy  individuals.  Data include  both T1-weighted  MR images 
and their labeling  of brain tissues.  The test sample is a collection  of sev- 
eral tens of individuals  with severe brain distortions.  The alterations  of 
brain structures  are not homogeneous  and can be aggregated  into four 
main categories  according  to the etiology  and characteristics  of brain 
distortion.  Each category  has a diﬀerent  level of complexity  concerning  
the task of tissue segmentation.  As part of the benchmark,  we present  a 
baseline  as a reference  method  ( Amorosino  et al., 2020 ) to carry out the 
tissue segmentation  with a deep learning  approach  ( Ronneberger  et al., 
2015 ). 
The proposed  benchmark  comprises  a dataset,  both training  and 
test, published  on BrainLife,  an open science  platform  for secure neu- 
roscience  data analysis  ( Avesani  et al., 2019 ). In addition,  we provide  
the code to reproduce  on cloud infrastructure  the preprocessing  of data, 
the results of the baseline  method,  and the evaluation  metric. 
In the following  Section,  we formulate  the deﬁnition  of the task for 
tissue segmentation  according  to a supervised  learning  approach.  Sub- 
sequent  Sections  will illustrate  the dataset structure,  the annotation  pro- 
cess, a baseline  method,  and the related empirical  results.  
2. Problem  statement  
In this section,  we formulate  the problem  of brain tissue segmenta-  
tion as a supervised  learning  task. We ﬁrst introduce  the type of MR 
images for the recording  of brain structures  and at the end, we deﬁne a 
common  metric to quantify  the accuracy  of the segmentation  results.  
2.1. T1-w MRI image 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI) is usually  concerned  with 
single-channel  grayscale  images represented  as 3D scalar matrices  of 
voxels, namely  volumetric  pixels, distributed  on a 3D regular  grid 
( Zwanenburg  et al., 2016 ). The voxel value is proportional  to the MR 
signal intensity  of the appropriate  acquired  portion  of the space, which 
is representative  of the characteristics  of the biological  tissue at that 
point ( Cercignani  et al., 2021 ). MR images have a variable  contrast  and 
resolution  depending  on diﬀerent  factors such as the parameters  of se- 
quence,  the magnetic  ﬁeld strength,  and the scan time of the acquisi-  
tion ( Symms,  2004; Bloomﬁeld  et al., 2017 ). One of the most widely 
used MR images is the 3D T1-weighted  (T1-w) image ( Ai et al., 2021 ). 
The T1-w images show an excellent  contrast  between  the main brain 
structure  as white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal  
ﬂuid (CSF) ( Bloomﬁeld  et al., 2017 ; Yan et al. (2020) ). The T1-w acqui- 
sition sequences  are designed  to weigh the image on the T1 relaxation  
time, characteristic  of the tissue type ( Stanisz et al., 2005 ). Tissues  with a longer relaxation  time, such as CSF, have a lower signal and there- 
fore have a darker color ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Instead,  WM has a more 
intense  signal and therefore  has a color tending  to white. The GM has 
an intermediate  signal between  WM and CSF that has a grayish  color 
( Henderson,  1983 ). In Fig. 1 .A are shown 5 slices of a T1-w brain image 
in axial projection.  
2.2. Brain tissue segmentation  
We deﬁne brain tissue segmentation  as the parcellation  of the im- 
age into homogeneous  non-overlapping  brain regions  ( Despotovi  et al., 
2015 ). A set of labels are deﬁned  according  to the number  of targeted  
anatomical  structures.  The voxels encoding  the same type of tissue are 
assigned  to the correspondent  label. The segmented  image has the same 
dimension  as the original  image, where the value of a voxel is the label 
code, usually  an integer,  instead  of the signal intensity.  
The recorded  T1-w images include  not only the brain but the whole 
head and the neck as well. For this reason,  a brain mask is generally  
computed  to perform  the extraction  of brain volume  before the segmen-  
tation task ( Bloomﬁeld  et al., 2017 ). All the voxels outside  the brain are 
considered  background,  and their values are usually  set to 0. The eval- 
uation of the segmentation  task is restricted  to the voxels of the brain 
only. 
Given a 3D image 𝑋 = ( 𝑣 1 , 1 , 1 , …, 𝑣 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 , …, 𝑣 𝐼,𝐽,𝐾 ) where 𝑣 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∈ℝ , 
its segmentation  is a three dimensional  volume  of the same size 𝑌 = 
( 𝑣 1 , 1 , 1 , …, 𝑣 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 , …, 𝑣 𝐼,𝐽,𝐾 ) where 𝑣 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∈𝐿 = {1 , …, 𝑙} .

and motor cortex (between  4 and 8 Hz) modulates  the phase of low- 
frequency  activity  in auditory  areas ( Park et al., 2015 ). This modula-  
tion may reﬂect a domain-general  mechanism  extending  beyond  speech 
processing  with the motor system orchestrating  sensory  processing  in 
time ( Morillon  and Baillet, 2017 ). Whether  the motor system provides  
domain-general  temporal  predictions  or richer domain-speciﬁc  informa-  
tion about articulatory  features,  is however  still unclear.  Indeed,  top- 
down motor inﬂuences  may exploit action circuits  to implement  an in- 
ternal ‘simulation’  of movements  ( Morillon  et al., 2019 ; Arnal and Gi- 
raud 2012 ; Schubotz  2007 ). 
To investigate  this relevant  question,  we designed  an EEG ex- 
periment  where participants  listened  to auditorily  presented  sen- 
tences. The sentences  were obtained  from a publicly  available  dataset 
( Canevari  et al., 2015 ) in which acoustic  data is synchronized  with artic- 
ulatory  data recorded  via electromagnetic  articulography  (EMA).  EMA 
uses miniaturized  sensor coils placed on articulators  (lips, jaws, tongue)  
to measure  accurate  position  data with a high sampling  frequency  dur- 
ing speech production.  Of key relevance  to the current  research  is that 
the EMA provides  the accurate  description  of speech articulators  that is 
essential  to uncover  whether  motor information  contributes  to the rep- 
resentation  of speech in the listener’s  brain. To this end, we used the Par- 
tial Information  Decomposition  (PID) method  ( Williams  and Beer 2010 ; 
Ince, 2017 ) that is designed  to separate  unique,  redundant  (shared),  or 
synergistic  (complementary)  information  provided  by two source sig- 
nals (here speech envelope  and kinematic  data) about a third target sig- 
nal (here brain activity).  We thus tested whether  articulatory  kinematics  
is encoded  during listening  and conveys  information  about speech that 
cannot be obtained  from the speech envelope  alone, i.e. unique neu- 
ral information  about kinematics  or synergistic  neural representation  of 
speech envelope  and kinematics  (a better prediction  of the neural re- 
sponse from both modalities  simultaneously).  Our hypothesis  was that, 
if speech-related  neural entrainment  entails also a domain-speciﬁc  mo- 
tor process,  entrainment  to speech kinematics  will be observed.

1. Introduction  
Functional  connectivity  (FC) has emerged  over the past two decades  
as a technique  to investigate  the functional  anatomy  of human brain 
networks  and the eﬀects of psychological,  pathological  and perceptual  
manipulations,  therapeutic  treatments,  and disease  states on brain func- 
tion ( Baliki et al., 2012 ; Biswal et al., 1995 ; Crowther  et al., 2015 ; 
Khalili-Mahani  et al., 2017 ; Raichle  et al., 2001 ). A network  of brain re- 
gions, which we term the descending  pain modulatory  network  (DPMN),  
has been well-studied  during simultaneous  experience  of phasic painful 
heat stimuli,  concurrent  painful heat and distracting  stimuli,  during 
mind-wandering,  placebo  analgesia,  and altered pain states such as 
brush allodynia  ( Becerra  et al., 2006 ; Bingel et al., 2006 ; Eippert  et al., 
2009 ; Kucyi et al., 2013 ; Linnman  et al., 2012b ; Moulton  et al., 2007 ; 
Petrovic  et al., 2002 ; Valet et al., 2004 ). We consider  a cortical  or sub- 
cortical  brain region to be part of the DPMN if it is diﬀerentially  acti- 
vated during pain modulation  and has relatively  high concentrations  
of μ-opioid  receptors  ( Henriksen  and Willoch,  2008 ). Demonstrating  
the potential  clinical  importance  of the DPMN,  enhanced  FC within the 
DPMN during placebo  analgesia  and motor cortex stimulation  is posi- 
tively related to magnitude  of analgesia  experienced  ( Bingel et al., 2006 ; 
Eippert  et al., 2009 ; Garcia-Larrea  and Peyron,  2007 ; Meeker  et al., 
2019 ); additionally,  there is a reduction  of FC of the DPMN in chronic  
pain patients  compared  to pain-free  controls  ( Linnman  et al., 2012b ; 
Yu et al., 2014 ). In healthy  individuals,  coactivation  of the PAG and 
ACC during the experience  of phasic pain coupled  with analgesic  cogni- 
tive manipulations,  such as placebo,  results in enhanced  FC between  
these regions  accompanied  by a reduction  in perceived  pain inten- 
sity ( Bingel et al., 2006 ; Eippert  et al., 2009 ; Fairhurst  et al., 2007 ; 
Kucyi et al., 2013 ; Sprenger  et al., 2011 ; Valet et al., 2004 ). Several  
regions  in the ACC surrounding  the genu of the corpus callosum  have 
been implicated  in pain modulation,  therefore  we interrogate  three sep- 
arate ROIs in the region of the ACC including  pregenual  (pACC),  ante- 
rior subgenual  ACC (sACC) and supragenual  ACC (spACC)  ( Bingel et al., 
2006 ; deCharms  et al., 2005 ; Seymour  et al., 2005 ; Valet et al., 2004 ; 
Wiech et al., 2005 ). 
While several studies have evaluated  the network’s  FC during phasic 
painful stimuli there is a scarcity  of studies exploring  FC during pro- 
longed tonic pain ( Ayoub et al., 2021 ; Bingel et al., 2006 ; Kucyi et al., 
2013 ; Seminowicz  and Davis, 2007 ; Valet et al., 2004 ). Tonic pain states, 
such as those encountered  in chronic  pain syndromes,  display  unique 
perceptual  dynamics  and modeling  prolonged  tonic pain in healthy  par- 
ticipants  is a critical intermediate  step in understanding  the neurophys-  
iology of chronic  pain disorders  ( Baliki et al., 2006 ; Foss et al., 2006 ). 
To probe the functional  modulation  of relationships  within the 
DPMN during a prolonged  tonic painful stimulus  in a preclinical  human 
pain model, we acquired  resting state fMRI scans in pain-free  partici-  
pants before and after exposing  them to a potent topical capsaicin-heat  
pain (C-HP) model ( Anderson  et al., 2002 ; Meeker  et al., 2019 ), thereby  
capturing  pain-free  and prolonged  tonic pain resting states within a sin- 
gle imaging  session.  
In this report, we predicted  that prolonged  tonic pain would dis- 
rupt the coupling  between  the ACC and PAG since disruption  in FC 
between  ACC and PAG occurs in chronic  pain disorders  and the ACC 
displays  reductions  in local FC in chronic  pain ( Ke et al., 2015 ; Khalili-  
Mahani  et al., 2017 ; Li et al., 2016 ; Liu et al., 2012 ; Wei et al., 
2016 ; Wu et al., 2016 ). We further predicted  enhanced  FC between  
the AMYG and PBN during tonic pain compared  to the pain-free  state 
given the amygdaloparabrachial  transmission  pathway  and its role in 
pain response  and modulation  as evidenced  in rodent studies ( Chen and 
Heinricher,  2019 ; Kissiwaa  and Bagley,  2018 ; Raver et al., 2020 ; 
Roeder et al., 2016 ; Uddin et al., 2018 ). Finally,  we predicted  mod- 
ulation of a functional  connection  between  the PAG and parabrachial  
nucleus,  given primate  tractography  and rodent neurophysiology  impli- 
cating this pathway  in pain modulation  ( Chen and Heinricher,  2019 ; 
Mantyh,  1982a , 1983 ; Roeder et al., 2016 ). Support  for these predic- tions would add to the growing  body of evidence  of the association  of 
the DPMN to the perception  of tonic pain in healthy  humans.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Overview  
We report results from a total of 50 participants  enrolled  in one of 
two studies conducted  at University  of Maryland  Baltimore  (UMB) from 
October  2011 until December  2015. Study 1 set out to establish  the ef- 
fects of a prolonged  tonic pain stimulus  lasting several minutes  on the 
functional  organization  of the human brain ( Fig. 1 A). In the ﬁrst study, 
we conducted  experiments  provoking  pain in 18 healthy  participants  
(10 M; 2 left-handed)  aged 23 to 61 (median  = 30.5) by applying  10% 
capsaicin  cream under a warm thermode  on their left leg, which we 
term the capsaicin-heat  pain (C-HP) model to distinguish  it from previ- 
ous models using lower concentration  capsaicin  creams ( Anderson  et al., 
2002 ; Cavallone  et al., 2013 ; Meeker  et al., 2019 ; Petersen  and Row- 
botham,  1999 ). We conducted  a screening  session to eliminate  partic- 
ipants who did not develop  suﬃcient  heat allodynia  during the C-HP 
( Liu et al., 1998 ). Eligible  participants  then took part in an MRI session 
which was separated  by ≥ 13 days (median  = 39.5 (range = 13 to 88)) from 
the screening  session.  Using the C-HP model we maintained  a mild to 
moderate  pain intensity  with a 39 °C ( n = 11), 40 °C (6) or 41 °C (1) 
thermode.  The temperature  selected  for each participant  was based on 
that individual’s  thermal  heat pain sensitivity  evaluated  at screening  just 
prior to the C-HP exposure.  
In study 2, 40 participants  (17 M; median  age: 24; range 20–39) un- 
derwent  an MRI in which we employed  the C-HP model with a 38 °C 
( n = 4), 39 °C (2), 40 °C (6), 41 °C (8), or 42 °C (20) thermode  ( Fig. 1 B). 
From this group of participants,  3 males were excluded  from the current  
report because  they reported  pain ratings of 0 out of 100 during the last 
2 min of exposure  to the C-HP model (C-HP temperatures  for these par- 
ticipants  were all 42 °C). A further 4 males and 1 female were excluded  
due to having greater than 0.5 mm motion framewise  displacement  in 
at least 10% of the functional  MR time series (1 at 40 °C, 1 at 41 °C, 
2 at 42 °C). Resting  state fMRI results from study 1 and 2 are pooled 
together  and use the same MRI sequence  and protocol,  excepting  that 
scans were acquired  at diﬀerent  resolutions  (1.8 ×1.8 ×4 mm 3 versus 
3 mm 3 isotropic)  with diﬀerent  head coils (12- versus 32- channel).  All 
participants  provided  written  informed  consent,  and all procedures  were 
approved  by the UMB Institutional  Review  Board for the Protection  of 
Human  Subjects.  
2.1.1. Eligibility  criteria 
In study 1 exclusion  criteria  were: pregnancy;  history of brain injury 
with any period of unconsciousness;  illicit, or prescription  opioid, drug 
use; current  pain or history of chronic  pain; history of cardiac,  renal, 
hepatic,  or pulmonary  function  disorders;  history of cancer;  ambidex-  
trous ( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ); hospitalized  for a psychiatric  disorder  within last 
12 months;  pain intensity  rating less than 21 on a 0–100 NRS while ex- 
posed to the C-HP model. Illicit drug use was determined  with a urine 
drug screen for marijuana,  cocaine  methamphetamine,  amphetamines,  
ecstasy,  heroin, phencyclidine,  benzodiazepines,  methadone,  barbitu-  
rates, tricyclic  antidepressants  or oxycodone  (First Check TM ). 
In study 2, in addition  to eligibility  criteria  for study 1, we excluded  
left-handed  participants,  any individual  with any diagnosis  of psycho-  
logical or neurological  disorder  or participants  taking any psychoactive  
medications  (by self-report).  However,  in study 2 we did not exclude  
any individual  based on sensitivity  to the C-HP model. 
2.1.2. Psychophysics  and psychological  questionnaires  
During the initial session of each study, we measured  participants’  
warmth  detection  thresholds  (WDTs)  and heat pain thresholds  (HPTs) 
with a Medoc stimulator  (Pathway;  Medoc;  Ramat Yishai, Israel) using

Fig. 1. (A) In study 1, 18 participants  experienced  a pain-free  resting state scan and 40 min later experienced  the same resting state scan while experiencing  thermal 
allodynia  induced  by capsaicin.  (B) In study 2, 40 participants  experienced  a pain-free  resting state scan and then 40 min later experienced  the same resting state scan 
while experiencing  thermal allodynia  induced  by capsaicin.  Scans used in the analysis  in the present report are demarcated  in red. Abbreviations:  WDT –warmth

the method  of limits ( Greenspan,  2013 ). We placed the 3 ×3 cm con- 
tact area stimulator  on the lower left foreleg at a baseline  temperature  
of 32 °C. A program  increased  the temperature  at a ramp of 0.5 °C/s 
until the participant  pressed  a mouse button.  We instructed  the partic- 
ipant to press the button when they “felt a change in temperature  ”for 
WDTs or when the warmth  “becomes  painful ”for HPTs. At a single site, 
we measured  four trials for WDTs and HPTs. We took the average  of 
the last three threshold  determinations  for each participant.  In study 2, 
the protocol  for HPTs started with a baseline  of 30 °C, to accommodate  
sensitivity  changes  after capsaicin  exposure.

However,  single cell recording  in monkeys  provided  compelling  evi- 
dence at the neuronal  level that separate  populations  of neurons  within 
the FEF ( Awh et al., 2006 ; Bruce and Goldberg,  1985 ; Bruce et al., 1985 ; 
Cohen et al., 2009 ; Sato and Schall, 2003 ; Schall, 1991 ) (e.g., visual and 
movement  neurons)  drive attentional  location  selection  and gaze con- 
trol ( Schall, 2004 ; Thompson  et al., 2005 ). This dissociation  provided  
support  for the independence  between  overt and covert orienting.  
In contrast  to the two extreme  models of complete  dependence  
and complete  independence  between  overt and covert orienting,  a 
more moderate  model of an interdependent  relationship  has been pro- 
posed with resources  or computations  shared at certain but not all 
stages by overt and covert orienting  ( Belopolsky  and Theeuwes,  2012 ; 
Casteau  and Smith, 2019 ; Corbetta  et al., 1998 ; Hunt and King- 
stone, 2003 ; Jonikaitis  and Moore, 2019 ; Posner,  1980 ). It has been 
argued that this relationship  is supported  by a large-scale  functional  
segregation  of the FPN, with the IPS more involved  in orienting  and 
the FEF more involved  in t eye movement,  or supported  by a par- 
tial segregation  as diﬀerent  subdivisions  within regions  of the FPN 
(e.g., distinct  “overt ”a n d “covert  ”a r e a s  within the FEF and IPS) 
( Corbetta,  1998 ; Posner,  1980 ). In contrast,  single cell recording  stud- 
ies revealed  a continuum  of visual-movement  functions  among neu- 
rons within the FEF ( Moore et al., 2012 ), suggesting  that there might 
be an ﬁne-scale  interdependent  representational  coding by popula-  
tions of neurons  with diﬀerent  preferences  for overt and covert ori- 
enting within the regions  of the FPN. The neural mechanism,  i.e., 
whether  large-scale  functional  segregation  or ﬁne-scale  representational  
coding underlies  this interdependent  relationship,  however,  remains  
elusive.  
Methodological  data-analytic  techniques  for functional  magnetic  res- 
onance imaging  (fMRI) data provide  advanced  tools for the decoding  
of the representation  of diﬀerent  cognitive  processes  in functionally  
overlapping  regions  of the brain. Compared  to the conventional  uni- 
variate analysis  with general  linear modeling  (GLM) typically  used to 
identify  and localize  brain regions  involved  in a certain process,  mul- 
tivariate  pattern  analysis  (MVPA)  has a speciﬁc  advantage  in decod- 
ing multidimensional  representation  as patterns  of activation  in vox- 
els or regions  associated  with diﬀerent  processes  in a commonly  in- 
volved region or network  ( Davis et al., 2014 ; Haxby, 2012 ; Peelen and 
Downing,  2007 ; Peelen et al., 2006 ). Although  the millimeter-level  spa- 
tial resolution  of the voxels in fMRI is much lower than the below- 
millimeter  columnar  level neural population,  patterns  of voxel-wise  ac- 
tivation  in a brain area decoded  by MVPA can reﬂect the underlying  
columnar  level organization  of representational  codes for a speciﬁc  cog- 
nitive process  ( Boynton,  2005 ; Haynes  and Rees, 2005 ; Kamitani  and 
Tong, 2005 ; Misaki et al., 2013 ). Therefore,  the representation  ecoding  
of overt and covert orienting  in the FPN can be examined  using MV- 
PAu. Enhancement  of spatial resolution  of fMRI data acquisition  would 
facilitate  the detection  of the ﬁne-scale  pattern  of neural representation  
( Gardumi  et al., 2016 ; Mandelkow  et al., 2017 ; Swisher  et al., 2010 ). 
In this study, we designed  a cue-target  attention  task to manipulate  
visuospatial  overt and covert orienting  by instructing  participants  ei- 
ther to move their eyes or maintain  central ﬁxation  following  a location  
cue. In addition,  to examine  generalizability  of the decoding  of overt 
and covert orienting,  we also manipulated  the cue type: voluntary  “en- 
dogenous  ”c u e i n g  that follows  a goal-oriented  decision  to attend to a 
speciﬁc  location  versus reﬂexive  “exogenous  ”cueing  in which attention  
is captured  via a salient cue ( Müller and Rabbitt,  1989 ; Posner,  1980 , 
2016 ; Posner et al., 1985 ). Brain activation  associated  with the task ma- 
nipulation  was measured  using accelerated  multiband  fMRI, together  
with simultaneous  eye-tracking  to monitor  participants’  eye movement.  
A GLM was conducted  ﬁrst to test the involvement  of the FPN in overt 
and covert orienting.  MVPA was then performed  to test whether  the 
overt versus covert orienting  could be decoded  by voxel-wise  patterns  of 
activation  within the FPN in a trial-by-trial  manner,  and to estimate  the 
patterns  (i.e., the representation)  of voxels with diﬀerent  preferences  
to overt and covert orienting.  To further characterize  the topological  organization  of the representation  in space, we decomposed  the pattern  
into overt- and covert-preferred  clusters  of voxels by using Morse theory 
and its discrete  version  ( Delgado-Friedrichs  et al., 2015 ; Forman,  2002 ; 
Milnor,  1963 ) and then quantiﬁed  the interleaving  pattern  of the two 
types of clusters  using spatial statistics  ( Diggle et al., 1976 ; Gómez-  
Rubio, 2016 ; Loosmore  and Ford, 2006 ). 
The existence  of interdependent  representational  coding of overt and 
covert orienting  in the FPN would be supported  by the ﬁndings  that 
(1) the FPN was commonly  activated  in both overt and covert orient- 
ing to demonstrate  the shared resources  for these two types of orient- 
ing; (2) the pattern  of voxel-wise  activation  in the FPN could be de- 
composed  into overt- and covert-preferred  voxels, and (3) a successful  
classiﬁcation  of overt and covert orienting  could be achieved  by overt- 
and covert-preferred  voxels solely, and would be signiﬁcantly  improved  
when combining  the two types of voxels, to demonstrate  the distinct  and 
interactive  representation  within the FPN. The organization  of this rep- 
resentation  (i.e., large-scale  functional  segregation  or ﬁne-scale  repre- 
sentational  coding)  could be further examined  by quantifying  the topo- 
logical distribution  of overt- and covert-preferred  clusters  of voxels.

regions  of diﬀerent  communities  ( Sporns,  2013 ). There is now ample 
evidence  from a range of studies that demonstrates  brain network  re- 
conﬁguration  as a function  of cognitive  performance  ( Bassett et al., 
2011 , 2015 ; Braun et al., 2015 ; Fransson  et al., 2018 ; Hearne  et al., 
2017 ; Ito et al., 2020 ; Mohr et al., 2016 ; Patil et al., 2021 ; Shine & 
Poldrack,  2018 ). Hence, the ﬂexibility  of the brain to shift between  seg- 
regated  and integrated  states is inherently  important  in understanding  
brain function,  but the underlying  neural mechanism  that gives rise to 
the ﬂexibility  in brain states is poorly understood.  
Whilst there are numerous  structures  in the brain that shape in- 
trinsic cortical  variability,  the components  of the neuromodulatory  sys- 
tems are a primary  candidate  for enabling  the brain to ﬂexibly  shift 
network  topology  ( Mei et al., 2022 ; Müller et al., 2020 ; Munn et al., 
2021 ; Shine, Aburn, et al., 2018 ; Shine et al., 2016 , 2019 , 2021a ; 
Wainstein  et al., 2021 ). The neuromodulatory  systems  consists  of a 
range of autonomous  nuclei across the brainstem  and forebrain  that send 
diverse  anatomical  projections  throughout  the brain, wherein  they re- 
lease neurotransmitters  that engage second-messenger  cascades  within 
target neurons  that alter the receptivity  and/or excitability  of neu- 
rons ( Marder,  2012 ; Shine, 2019 ). The inﬂuence  of these regions  ul- 
timately  leads to large-scale  eﬀects on macroscopic  neural dynamics  
( Brown et al., 2011 ; Shine et al., 2021a ) that are known to facilitate  
novel dynamical  regimes  ( Aston-Jones  & Cohen, 2005 ; McGinley  et al., 
2015 ; Wainstein  et al., 2022 ).. In support  of this mechanism,  recent 
modelling  work established  that increasing  diﬀuse cortical  coupling  
across the brain –a feature that mimics  aspects  of the ascending  arousal  
system –resulted  in multi-stable  dynamics  that maximise  the temporal  
ﬂexibility  of brain states ( Müller et al., 2020 ). Despite  their substantial  
impact on the brain, their small size and strong interconnections  make 
the hubs of the neuromodulatory  system inherently  challenging  to study 
with traditional  neuroimaging  approaches  ( Alcedo & Prahlad,  2020 ). 
For these reasons,  the neuromodulatory  systems  are commonly  studied  
in isolation,  such that there is little understanding  of the interactions  be- 
tween diﬀerent  neuromodulatory  systems  and whether  diﬀerent  systems  
will work antagonistically  or synergistically  to facilitate  brain function.  
Whilst there are multiple  diﬀerent  neuromodulatory  systems  in 
the brain, the noradrenergic  and cholinergic  systems  are prime can- 
didates  for inﬂuencing  broad-scale  neural dynamics  and shifting  net- 
work topology  ( Shine, 2019 ) ( Fig. 1 B, E). The primary  cortically-  projecting  hubs of these systems  –t h e noradrenergic  locus coeruleus  
(LC) ( Carter et al., 2010 ) and cholinergic  nucleus  basalis of Meyn- 
ert (nbM) ( Lee & Dan, 2012 ) –a r e capable  of altering  oscillatory  
activity  across the brain: typically  by decreasing  low-frequency  syn- 
chronous  brain activity,  whilst concurrently  increasing  high-frequency  
brain activity  ( Castro-Alamancos  & Gulati, 2014 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Mena- 
Segovia  et al., 2008 ). This can ultimately  change the timescale  of neu- 
ral inﬂuences  on the brain network  ( Shine, 2019 ). Interestingly,  despite 
similar mechanisms  of action, the noradrenergic  and cholinergic  systems  
are associated  with distinct  cognitive  signatures:  the cholinergic  system 
has been implicated  in attentional  selection,  enhanced  cue detection,  
memory  encoding  and cognitive  speciﬁcity  ( Hasselmo  & Sarter, 2011 ; 
Noudoost  & Moore, 2011 ), whereas  the noradrenergic  system is involved  
in coordinating  arousal  ( Samuels  & Szabadi,  2008 ) optimizing  the bal- 
ance between  task-performance  ( Aston-Jones  & Cohen, 2005 ) salience  
detection  ( Sara & Bouret,  2012 ) and exploratory  behaviours  ( Sara & 
Bouret,  2012 ). 
The noradrenergic  and cholinergic  systems  also have diﬀerent  pro- 
jection patterns  in the brain. While the noradrenergic  LC sends vast 
projections  around the entire cortex ( Kim et al., 2016 ; Samuels  & Sz- 
abadi, 2008 ) ( Fig. 1 A), the cholinergic  nbM instead  projects  in a much 
more targeted  manner  to disparate  sites around the cerebral  cortex 
( Kim et al., 2016 ; Zaborszky  et al., 2015 ) ( Fig. 1 D). Based on these 
features,  we recently  proposed  that recruitment  of the noradrenergic  
system would shift the networks  of the brain into a state of increased  
network  integration  ( Shine, Aburn, et al., 2018 ; Shine, van den Brink, 
et al., 2018 ), whereas  the cholinergic  system has been implicated  in a 
relative  segregation  of network  topology  ( Zaborszky  et al., 2015 ). In 
previous  work, we have observed  evidence  for these network  eﬀects in 
7T resting state fMRI data ( Munn et al., 2021 ). In addition,  the LC is 
known to send projections  to the nbM that ultimately  excite the cholin- 
ergic nucleus,  however  the same is not true for the nbM, which can 
only aﬀect LC indirectly  through  shared targets ( Schwarz  & Luo, 2015 ; 
Zaborszky  et al., 1993 , 2015 ; Zaborszky  & Gombkoto,  2017 ). This “one- 
way ”connection  implies  a precise topological  relationship  between  the 
LC and nbM that likely provides  important  constraints  over how these 
two hubs impact evolving  brain dynamics.  
In addition  to altering  network  topology,  the noradrenergic  and 
cholinergic  systems  can also impact brain state dynamics  over time, 
2  N.L. Taylor, A. D’Souza, B.R. Munn et al. NeuroImage  260 (2022) 119455 
in a manner  that is well-captured  by the dynamical  systems  theory 
concept  of an attractor  landscape  ( John et al., 2022 ). Brieﬂy,  this ap- 
proach creates a low-dimensional  topological  representation  of changes  
in systems-level  neural dynamics  where the probability  of the occur- 
rence of a brain state (instantaneous  neural activity)  can be related to 
a statistical  ‘energy’  required  to reach that state –for instance,  a com- 
mon (rare) brain state would be associated  with a low (high) energy . 
Just like a contour  winds its way across the land, individual  trajecto-  
ries across the state space represent  unique individual  cognitive  states. 
Using this framework,  we found that following  phasic bursts of the LC, 
the attractor  landscape  was ﬂattened  (relative  to resting dynamics)  –
the brain entered  into a state that lowered  previously  high-energy  tran- 
sitions ( Fig. 1 C) ( Munn et al., 2021 ). In contrast,  phasic bursts of the 
nbM deepened  the local wells of the attractor  landscape  ( Fig. 1 F), sug- 
gesting that the brain was conﬁned  into a particular  state ( Munn et al., 
2021 ). Despite  these links, to date little research  has established  the 
relationship  between  these eﬀects and individual  diﬀerences  in white 
matter connections  strength  between  the noradrenergic  and choliner-  
gic hubs, and its role in governing  dynamic  brain topology.  Interest-  
ingly, cholinergic  neurons  in the basal forebrain  receive  extensive,  exci- 
tatory (i.e., G q -mediated)  synaptic  projections  from the LC, but do not 
send projections  back ( Hajszán  & Zaborszky,  2002 ; Smiley et al., 1999 ; 
Zaborszky  et al., 1993 ), implying  a dependent  topological  relationship  
whose functional  implications  remain poorly understood.  
Here, we investigated  the relation  of structural  connections  between  
hubs of the noradrenergic  and cholinergic  systems  and emergent  proper-  
ties of dynamic  functional  network  topology  and energy/attractor  land- 
scape topography.  Speciﬁcally,  we used an advanced  quantitative  ﬁ- 
bre tractography  analysis  of high-resolution  diﬀusion  weighted  imaging  
from the Human  Connectome  Project to estimate  the strength  of white 
matter connections  between  projection  hubs of the cholinergic  and no- 
radrenergic  arousal  systems.  We then used time-varying  functional  con- 
nectivity,  network  topology,  and energy/attractor  landscape  analyses  
to characterise  the relationship  between  ﬂexible  network  architecture  
and the strength  of structural  connectivity  between  the LC and nbM. 
Through  this approach,  we highlight  clear relationships  between  struc- 
ture and function  that travel through  neuromodulatory  intermediates  to 
shape and constrain  ﬂexible  network-level  signatures  of adaptive  brain 
function.  
2. Methods  
2.1. MRI acquisition  
We used the multi-modal  neuroimaging  data available  from the Hu- 
man Connectome  Project (HCP) ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ), which was 
acquired  using a 3T Siemens  ‘Connectom’  Skyra scanner  and included  
anatomical  T1-weighted  imaging,  structural  diﬀusion  MRI, and func- 
tional MRI data. Due to the computational  requirements  involved  in per- 
forming  rigorous  advanced  ﬁbre tractography,  we speciﬁcally  consid-  
ered 50 subjects  (Age range: 22-35, 29 females)  from the WU-Minn  HC 
( Van Essen et al., 2013 ) as a balance  between  computational  demands  
and a suitable  number  of subjects  to characterise  group behaviour.  The 
high resolution  T1-weighted  data were acquired  with 0.7 mm isotropic  
resolution,  TR/TE = 2400/2.14  ms, and ﬂip angle = 8°. The diﬀu- 
sion MRI protocol  consisted  of three diﬀusion-weighted  shells (b-values:  
1000, 2000 and 3000 s/mm 2 , with 90 diﬀusion-weighting  directions  in 
each shell) and 18 reference  volumes  (b = 0 s/mm 2 ). Each diﬀusion-  
weighted  image was acquired  twice, with opposite  phase-encoded  di- 
rection to correct for image distortion  ( Andersson  et al., 2003 ). The 
diﬀusion  MRI data was acquired  with 1.25 mm isotropic  resolution,  
TR/TE = 5520/89.5  ms, and ﬂip angle = 78°. For more details about 
the acquisition  protocol,  please refer to Van Essen et al., 2013 . For each 
subject,  14mins  of resting state fMRI data were acquired  using multi- 
band gradient-echo  imaging  (TR = 720ms,  echo time = 3",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5371, 5374), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(11157, 11159), match='3.'>"

1. Introduction  
For decades,  the cerebellum  was attributed  to have an exclusive  role 
in motor control.  Recently,  growing  evidence  suggests  a more general  
involvement  of the cerebellum  in the adaptive  control also of cogni- 
tive and emotional  processing.  In fact, morphometric  studies demon-  
strate signiﬁcant  cerebellar  atrophy  with age and in a number  of non- 
motor brain diseases,  e.g. schizophrenia,  autism or Alzheimer’s  disease  
( Diedrichsen  et al., 2015; D’Mello  et al., 2015; Han et al., 2020a; Lin 
et al., 2020; Marek et al., 2018; Okugawa  et al., 2003; Toniolo  et al., 
2018; Webb et al., 2009; Womer  et al., 2016 ). In healthy  humans,  the 
representation  of cerebral  networks  and cognitive  domains  has been in- 
vestigated  using functional  connectivity  ( Buckner  et al., 2011 ) as well 
as task functional  MRI ( King et al., 2019 ). These complementary  stud- 
ies have helped to increase  knowledge  about the role of the cerebellum  
in cognitive  and emotional  processes.  This notwithstanding,  the cere- 
bellum is crucial for motor control,  in particular  metric and power of 
target movements.  With regard to movement  disorders,  cerebellar  at- 
rophy is the characterizing  feature in ataxias,  which manifest  as ac- 
quired, genetic,  or sporadic  degenerative  diseases.  With clinical  fea- 
tures including  progressive  loss of balance,  coordination  deﬁcits,  and 
slurred speech,  ataxia patients  suﬀer substantial  restrictions  of mobil- 
ity and communicative  skills. In genetic  ataxies,  such as the worldwide  
most common  autosomal  dominantly  inherited  spinocerebellar  ataxia 
type 3 (SCA3),  the manifest  or ataxic stage of the disease  is preceded  
by a pre-ataxic  stage, in which neurodegeneration  is already  quantiﬁ-  
able, e.g., as cerebellar  atrophy,  while manifest  ataxia is not yet present  
( Faber et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Rezende  et al., 2018 ). Preventive  
interventions  that aim to silence the disease  gene in pre-ataxic  muta- 
tion carriers  oﬀer a promising  treatment  option prior to clinical  onset 
( McLoughlin  et al., 2018 ). Now, that the ﬁrst clinical  gene silencing  
trial has recently  started (ClinicalTrials.gov  Identiﬁer:  NCT05160558),  
there is an urgent need for non-invasive  biomarkers  to assess disease  
manifestation  and progression,  and to quantify  potential  treatment  ef- 
fects as clinical  scales lack sensitivity  during the pre-ataxic  stage. Accu- 
rate cerebellar  volume  estimation  from structural  MRI is a relevant  neu- 
roanatomical  marker.  However,  fast automated  determination  of cere- 
bellar volumes  is required,  as detailed,  manual  volumetry,  especially  
of sub-regions,  is too time-consuming.  Clearly,  automated  segmentation  
will beneﬁt various  study designs,  by reducing  workload  and by improv-  
ing reliability.  
In the present  work, we introduce  CerebNet  , an automated  method  to 
sub-segment  the cerebellum  at the lobular  level based on T1-weighted  
MRI. Our labels focus on a detailed  boundary  delineation  between  cere- 
bellar gray matter (CGM) and cerebellar  white matter (CWM)  captur-  
ing the branches  of CWM that reach into the cerebellar  cortex based 
on T1-weighted  MRI. Our deep learning  method  leverages  the Fast- 
Surfer approach  ( Henschel  et al., 2020 ) of multiple  2D networks  and 
minimal  pre-processing  to obtain detailed  boundary  segmentations.  
Since CerebNet  does not require  any preprocessing  steps and performs  
the localization  and segmentation  of 27 cerebellar  regions  in only 
12 seconds  per MRI, it is optimally  suited to also eﬃciently  process  
and screen in large data sets. With very labor-intensive  manual  ref- 
erence segmentation,  the methodological  challenge  is to achieve  high 
accuracy  and generalizability  despite a small reference  dataset.  To 
this eﬀect, we perform  extensive  pre-training  on representative  cross- 
study datasets  and apply several data augmentation  steps including  
realistic  non-linear  deformations  to ensure wide applicability.  More- 
over, we validate  our method  with respect to test-retest  reliability  and 
in an association  study of neuro-morphometric  cerebellum  markers  
across 109 SCA3 mutation  carriers,  including  42 pre-ataxic  participants,  
as well as 41 healthy  controls.  Results reveal stronger  group diﬀer- 
ences for CerebNet  consistent  with known patterns  of neurodegenerative  
changes.  1.1. Protocols  and anatomical  reference  
The Schmahmann  atlas ( Schmahmann  et al., 1999 ) is the standard  
anatomical  reference  for cerebellar  cortex sub-segmentation  protocols  
( Bogovic  et al., 2013b; Park et al., 2014 ) including  the “Spatially  Unbi- 
ased Infratentorial  Template  ”(SUIT)  ( Diedrichsen,  2006 ). It introduces  
a uniﬁed terminology  of the nomenclature.  Slices of the cerebellum  are 
directly  compared  with the corresponding  slices of MR images,  thus 
facilitating  the identiﬁcation  of anatomical  landmarks.  Brieﬂy summa-  
rized, the CGM is macroscopically  subdivided  into the midline  vermis 
and four hemispheric  lobes: the anterior,  posterior-superior,  posterior-  
inferior,  and the ﬂocculonodular  lobe. The anterior  and posterior  lobes 
are further subdivided  into lobules.  The vermis is subdivided  analo- 
gously to the hemispheres  except for the anterior  lobe. Like all previous  
protocols,  ours follows  the nomenclature  introduced  by Schmahmann  
( Schmahmann  et al., 1999 ) and our segmentation  is largely comparable  
to previous  protocols  ( Bogovic  et al., 2013b; Diedrichsen,  2006; Park 
et al., 2014 ). The protocols  for segmenting  the cerebellum  on MR im- 
ages diﬀer in the level of detail at which single anterior  lobules  and ver- 
mal subsegments  are distinguished  or aggregated  ( Bogovic  et al., 2013b; 
Diedrichsen,  2006; Park et al., 2014 ). Previous  work has largely only dif- 
fered in ﬁnding  an aggregation  compromise  in the level of detail for seg- 
ments I-V. We detail a comparison  between  the diﬀerent  segmentation  
protocols  as well as to related automated  segmentation  procedures  in the 
appendix  of our protocol  for manual  segmentation(  Heinz et al., 2022 ). 
It should be noted, that all previous  protocols  ignore the CWM strands  
projecting  into the cerebellar  cortex ( Bogovic  et al., 2013b; Diedrichsen,  
2006; Park et al., 2014 ) simplifying  the CGM/CWM  boundary  to a con- 
nection  line across the base of CWM strands.  In consequence,  details at 
the CGM/CWM  boundary  of the cerebellum  are not captured  by any of 
the previous  protocols.  To allow deeper analysis  of the GM/WM  bound- 
ary in the cerebellum,  we extend our protocol  by a ﬁne-grained  segmen-  
tation of CWM strands  projecting  into the cerebellar  cortex. To foster re- 
producibility  and extensibility,  we establish  and publish  our illustrated  
segmentation  protocol  online with this publication  ( Heinz et al., 2022 ). 
1.2. Automated  methods  for cerebellar  sub-segmentation  
Several  methods  have been presented  for segmenting  cerebellar  sub- 
structures  including  both semi-automated  ( Pierson  et al., 2002 ) and 
fully automated  ( Bogovic  et al., 2013c; Carass et al., 2018; Diedrich-  
sen, 2006; Han et al., 2020b ) approaches.  While previous  methods  re- 
lied on atlas-based  registration  ( Diedrichsen,  2006; Diedrichsen  et al., 
2009; Park et al., 2014; Plassard  et al., 2016; Romero  et al., 2017 ), ar- 
tiﬁcial neural networks  ( Powell et al., 2008 ), support  vector machines  
( Powell et al., 2008 ), level sets ( Bogovic  et al., 2013a ), active appear-  
ance models ( Price et al., 2014 ), and patch matching  ( Romero  et al., 
2017; Weier et al., 2014 ), recent work introduced  deep learning  ( Han 
et al., 2020b; 2019 ). 
The reference  method  “Spatially  Unbiased  Infra-tentorial  Tem- 
plate ”( S U I T )  ( Diedrichsen,  2006 ) pioneered  fully automatic  cere- 
bellum sub-segmentation  using non-linear  registration  to an atlas. 
Powell et al. (2008) compared  atlas registration  with fully connected  
neural network  and support  vector machine  segmentation  methods,  and 
demonstrated  superior  performance  of learning  approaches.  ACCLAIM  
( Bogovic  et al., 2013a ), which is based on the Multiple  object Geomet-  
ric Deformable  Model framework  ( Bogovic  et al., 2013c; Carass and 
Prince, 2016 ), adapts a random  forest for boundary  classiﬁcation  to 
produce  topologically  correct results.  The Multiple  Automatically  Gen- 
erated Templates  brain segmentation  algorithm  (MAGeT)  ( Chakravarty  
et al., 2013; Park et al., 2014 ) creates a template  library,  then non- 
linearly  registers  the target image to each template.  The ﬁnal segmen-  
tation is achieved  by fusing multiple  segmentations  using majority  vot- 
ing. The Cerebellar  Analysis  Toolkit  (CATK)  ( Price et al., 2014 ) adapts 
2  J. Faber, D. Kügler, E. Bahrami et al. NeuroImage  264 (2022) 119703 
Bayesian  active appearance  modeling  ( Patenaude  et al., 2011 ) to gener- 
ate statistical  models for shape and texture and their inter-relationship  
as priors. RASCAL  ( Weier et al., 2014 ) utilizes  a patch matching-based  
approach,  which improves  the multi-atlas  segmentation  fusion method  
of Coupe et al. ( Coupé et  al., 2011 ) via majority  voting for label fu- 
sion and nonlinear  registration.  CERES ( Romero  et al., 2017 ), another  
patch matching-based  segmentation  tool, employs  the Optimized  Patch- 
Match Label fusion (OPAL)  method  ( Giraud et al., 2016; Ta et al., 2014 ). 
CERES2  ( Carass et al., 2018 ) improves  upon CERES ( Romero  et al., 
2017 ) by adding a patch-based  boosted  neural network  method  for error 
correction.  CGCUTS  ( Yang et al., 2016 ) combines  multi-atlas  labeling  
and random  forest classiﬁcation  in the context  of a graph cut frame- 
work to produce  the segmentation.  Van der Lijn et al. ( van der Lijn 
et al., 2009 ) present  a method  that combines  an appearance  model 
and atlas registration.  Carass et al. ( Carass et al., 2018 ) summarize  
and compare  several cerebellum  sub-segmentation  methods,  highlight-  
ing CERES2  ( Carass et al., 2018; Romero  et al., 2017 ) as the most per- 
formant  ‘traditional’  (i.e. non deep-learning)  approach.  However,  while 
image processing  with CERES1  is supported  online, CERES2  is unavail-  
able to the scientiﬁc  community.  
The most recent cerebellum  sub-segmentation  tool, Anatomical  Par- 
cellation  using a U-Net with Locally  Constrained  Optimization  (ACA- 
PULCO)  ( Han et al., 2020b ), introduces  a two-step  deep learning  method  
with two 3D convolutional  neural networks  (CNNs)  to ﬁrst localize  and 
then sub-segment  the cerebellum,  outperforming  the challenge  winner 
CERES2  ( Carass et al., 2018 ) in a head-to-head  comparison.  Preprocess-  
ing steps include  bias ﬁeld inhomogeneity  correction  and registration  
to MNI space. However,  both the training  and the evaluation  procedure  
include  some short-comings,  e.g. by forcing nearest  neighbor  label inter- 
polation  both during training  and evaluation,  predominantly  reducing  
detail in ﬁne structures  such as thin CWM strands.  In fact, reported  per- 
formance  metrics  were calculated  entirely  in MNI space, which required  
lossy nearest  neighbor  interpolation  of manual  reference  labels to MNI 
space potentially  mischaracterizing  segmentation  performance.  
In contrast  to ACAPULCO,  our method  does not require  any prepro-  
cessing steps such as bias ﬁeld correction  or spatial (atlas) normaliza-  
tion/registration  during inference.  Moreover,  to increase  the anatomi-  
cal variety in our training  data, we employ  various  augmentation  ap- 
proaches,  e.g. we generate  realistic  non-linear  deformations  via cross- 
subject registration  of training  images to various  images from multiple  
datasets.  To further improve  the generalization  of our model we pre- 
train the model on a compiled  cross-study  dataset.  We examine  the eﬀect 
of data augmentations  such as non-linear  deformation  and pre-training  
in several experiments.  In our proposed  method,  the neural network  
architecture  follows  FastSurferCNN  , a 2.5D approach  in which three 2D 
networks  for each axial, coronal,  and sagittal  view are trained  and the ﬁ- 
nal 3D prediction  is created  by view-aggregation  ( Henschel  et al., 2020 ).

change via magnetization  transfer  (MT) MRI (see Priovoulos  et al. 2018 , 
2020 ) that is likely to indirectly  indicate  dopamine  synthesis  and stor- 
age capacity  of the measured  neurons,  or dopaminergic  cell integrity.  
MT-MRI  captures  signal related to neuromelanin,  a by-product  of cat- 
echolamine  (dopamine,  norepinephrine)  synthesis  produced  by tyro- 
sine hydroxylase.  Neuromelanin  is concentrated  in catecholamine  neu- 
ron cell bodies in rats ( Dahlström,  1964 ) and human tissue ( Nobin and 
Bjorklund,  1973 ; van Domburg  and ten Donkelaar,  1991 ) and is linked 
to high concentrations  of cytosolic  dopamine  in the substantia  nigra 
( Zucca et al., 2014 ) and VTA ( Yamashita  et al., 2016 ). Neuromelanin  
production  by dopamine  synthesis  can have a protective  eﬀect on the 
cells or, if overexpressed,  can indicate  cell death, as observed  in indi- 
viduals  with Parkinson’s  disease  ( Zucca et al., 2014 ). Thus, MT-MRI  sig- 
nal intensity  can be indicative  of dopaminergic  cell integrity  and previ- 
ous work has linked this measure  of integrity  to reward-related  learn- 
ing and motivational  ﬂexibility  ( Chowdhury  et al., 2013 ; Steiger and 
Bunzeck,  2017 ). Combined  with MT-MRI,  it is also important  to take 
advantage  of the improved  signal separation  aﬀorded  by high-ﬁeld  MRI 
as input data for sophisticated  machine  learning  algorithms  for fast, ro- 
bust and data-driven  region delineation  that does not rely on human 
perception  or manual  drawings.  
In this study we utilize quantitative  high-resolution  400 μm 3 7T MT- 
MRI and machine  learning  techniques  to detect putative  dopaminergic  
neurons  in a data-driven  manner,  to capture  VTA in human subjects  
with and without  depression  and anxiety  disorders.  We also collect ob- 
jective measures  of intrinsic  and extrinsic  motivation  (bias) and reward 
sensitivity  (sigma)  heuristics  ( Morris et al., 2020 ) outside  of the scan- 
ner in a dimensional  manner  to examine  transdiagnostic  relationships  
between  VTA dopaminergic  neuronal  integrity  and motivational  tone 
in humans.  We hypothesize  that higher VTA dopaminergic  neuron in- 
tegrity is related to higher motivational  tone within both intrinsic  and 
extrinsic  domains.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Participants  aged 18-55 were recruited  via the Depression  and Anx- 
iety Center for Discovery  and Treatment,  Icahn School of Medicine  at 
Mount Sinai (ISMMS).  Subjects  were recruited  from web-based  adver- 
tising, ﬂyers or clinician  referrals.  Participants  with mood and anxiety  
(MA) disorders  were included  if they met criteria  for major depressive  
disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  or both, as determined  by the 
Structured  Clinical  Interview  for DSM-5,  performed  by a trained  clinical  
rater. MA participants  were allowed  comorbidities  of other anxiety,  de- 
pressive  or stress-related  disorders,  as is highly common  in MA subjects  
( Aina and Susman,  2006 ; Lamers  et al., 2011 ), but were not included  if 
they had other psychiatric  disorders  such as obsessive-compulsive  dis- 
order, substance  or alcohol  use disorder,  schizophrenia.  Healthy  control 
subjects  were free of any current  or past psychiatric  disorder.  All sub- 
jects were free from a history of current  or past neurological  disorder,  
signiﬁcant  head injury, or medications  with known antidepressant  or 
anxiolytic  eﬀects at the time of the scan. Individuals  who met all inclu- 
sion and exclusion  criteria  were enrolled  in the study and completed  an 
MRI scan, self-reported  measures  of symptoms  and a cognitive  test of 
intrinsic  and extrinsic  motivation  on the same day. Self-reported  symp- 
tom measures  were performed  via a web-based  questionnaire  system 
(Redcap)  and included  demographic  information  as well as key ques- 
tionnaires  assessing  anhedonia:  the Temporal  Experience  of Please Scale 
(TEPS);  and anxiety  symptoms:  State-Trait  Cognitive  and Somatic  Anx- 
iety (STICSA).  General  depression  was also assessed  with the Quick In- 
ventory  for Depression  Scale (QIDS).  The study was approved  by the IS- 
MMS Institutional  Review  Board, all subjects  provided  written  informed  
consent  and were compensated  for their time. 
Fifty-one  subjects  were scanned  in total. Of those, 8 were excluded  
due to technical  error, motion or incomplete  scanning.  Motion  was de- termined  via visual inspection  of images,  judgement  of image blurri- 
ness and/or visible subject motion during scanning  that was not rec- 
tiﬁed by repeat scan. This left 43 for analysis,  comprising  22 HC 
(age = 30.9 ± 8.6; 7 male) and 21 MA participants  (age = 30.5 ± 8.6; 
11 male). Of the 21 MA subjects,  11 had primary  MDD with 6 of those 
having a comorbid  anxiety  disorder,  and 10 had primary  GAD with 7 
having a comorbid  depressive  disorder,  as determined  by the SCID. See

All participants  underwent  7T MRI scanning  (Magnetom,  Siemens,  
Erlangen,  Germany)  with a 32-channel  transmit  coil at the BioMedi-  
cal Engineering  and Imaging  Institute  (BMEII),  ISMMS,  New York. A 
T1-weighted  structural  dual-inversion  magnetization  prepared  gradient

communities  ( Power et al., 2011 ). The brain’s community  structure  has 
been studied  in relation  to networks  estimated  from task fMRI reported  
activations  ( Stanley  et al., 2014 ) and from intrinsic  functional  systems  
identiﬁed  at rest ( Betzel et al., 2016 ; Di and Biswal,  2015 ). It is now 
hypothesized  that modular  structure  is important  for specialized  brain 
function  ( Bertolero  et al., 2015 ). This hypothesis  is supported  by stud- 
ies that have shown correspondence  between  intrinsic  networks  at rest 
and activations  in task-based  paradigms  ( Crossley  et al., 2013 ; Di et al., 
2013 ), as well as reconﬁguration  of modular  networks  between  rest and 
task ( Cohen and Esposito,  2016 ; Hearne  et al., 2017 ; Smith et al., 2009 ). 
However,  the focus has remained  primarily  on cortical  community  struc- 
ture, with less work focused  on contributions  from major subcortical  
regions  ( Bell and Shine, 2016 ). 
The basal ganglia  and related structures  within the subcortex  are in- 
volved in a diverse  set of functions  though intra-subcortical  communi-  
cation as well as with cortical  regions.  Core regions  of the subcortex,  the 
striatum  and globus pallidus  are predominantly  associated  with motor 
functions  and reward ( Haber and Knutson,  2010 ; Lanciego  et al., 2012 ), 
while other subcortical  structures  (thalamus,  amygdala,  hippocampus)  
have roles in emotional,  memory,  and sensorimotor  functions  through  
various  subcortical  and cortico-subcortical  circuits  ( Child and Benar- 
roch, 2013 ; Choi et al., 2017 ; Janak and Tye, 2015 ; Nakajima  and 
Halassa,  2017 ; Sherman,  2017 ). Early understanding  of subcortical  
function  comes from studies that employed  electrical  stimulation  and 
tract tracing in nonhuman  models ( Haber et al., 1990 ; Olds and Mil- 
ner, 1954 ), as well as lesion studies of human patients  ( Ward et al., 
2013 ). As fMRI has become  increasingly  used to map subcortical  or- 
ganization  and function  noninvasively  in vivo, studies that focused  
on subcortical  FC have shown connectivity  between  the amygdala  nu- 
clei and hippocampus,  caudate,  and several cortical  regions  (prefrontal  
cortex, insula, and cingulate)  ( Janak and Tye, 2015 ; Tillman  et al., 
2018 ; Weis et al., 2019 ). Diﬀerential  FC proﬁles  of thalamic  nu- 
clei connectivity  to cortical  and subcortical  regions  have also been 
observed  ( Child and Benarroch,  2013 ; Nakajima  and Halassa,  2017 ; 
Sherman,  2017 ). In recent years, methods  have emerged  that focus on 
network  connections/edges  more so than on network  nodes (for review 
see ( Faskowitz  et al., 2021 )). Among  those, Faskowitz  et al. (2020) de- 
veloped  a framework  that represents  the network  as functional  in- 
teractions  of edges, which can be clustered  to reveal an edge com- 
munity  structure,  where each edge is assigned  a community  label 
( Faskowitz  et al., 2020 ; Jo et al., 2021 ). This edge community  struc- 
ture approach  oﬀers a novel avenue  for investigating  subcortico-cortical  
interactions  and communication.  
The edge FC model uses nodal BOLD time series to estimate  co- 
ﬂuctuations  among pairs of nodes, which can be interpreted  as time- 
dependent  pattens  of communication.  Therefore,  community  structure  
obtained  from these co-ﬂuctuation  edge time series identiﬁes  groups of 
edges that may support  similar communication  strategies  among con- 
necting  nodes and, when mapped  back onto a node-by-node  matrix,  re- 
veals an overlapping  community  structure.  Prior work ( Faskowitz  et al., 
2020 ; Jo et al., 2021 ; Zamani  Esfahlani  et al., 2020 ) has focused  on map- 
ping cortical  communities,  revealing  a distinction  between  primary  sys- 
tems (visual,  somatomotor,  dorsal and ventral attention,  and temporal  
parietal)  and heteromodal  systems  (control,  default mode, and limbic),  
without  considering  the roles and contributions  of subcortical  nodes. To 
address  this, we investigated  how subcortical  regions  contribute  to, af- 
fect, or are aﬀected  by cortical  modular  organization.  Our hypothesis  
is that the subcortex,  via edge community  structure,  will diﬀerentially  
interact  with diﬀerent  cortical  systems.  We also introduce  a novel mo- 
tif analysis  based on edges’ community  assignments,  which we refer to 
as “edge community  triads ”, and we leverage  this approach  to further 
probe subcortico-cortical  communication  patterns.  Edge community  tri- 
ads are three node subgraphs  consisting  of four types, based on the or- 
ganization  of edge communities.  Given to the role of the subcortex  in in- 
formation  integration,  we hypothesized  that triads which connect  a sub- 
cortical  node to two cortical  nodes via the same edge community  will be over-represented  relative  to other triad types. This would demonstrate  
that subcortico-cortical  communication  patterns  as estimated  by edge 
community  structure  from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)  capture  biologi-  
cally meaningful  information  about subcortico-cortical  organization.

and H 2 15 O are separately  administered  to the subject for measurements  
of OEF and CBF, respectively.  However,  the method’s  clinical  utility has 
been limited largely by high radiation  exposure,  long imaging  time, and 
the cost and complexity  of the experimental  setting.  As a potentially  
more practical  and noninvasive  alternative,  MRI-based  methods  have 
emerged,  such as arterial-spin-labeling  (ASL) ( Alsop et al., 2015 ) in con- 
junction  with quantitative  BOLD (qBOLD)  ( An and Lin, 2000 ; He and 
Yablonskiy,  2007 ) yielding  CBF and OEF, respectively,  on a pixel-by-  
pixel basis. Additionally,  methods  generally  referred  to as calibrated  
BOLD (cBOLD)  ( Blockley  et al., 2013 ) permit voxel-wise  estimation  of 
relative  changes  of CMRO 2 in response  to neural stimulation  by cali- 
brating  BOLD signal in two presumed  isometabolic  states of the brain 
( Davis et al., 1998 ). Recent dual-gas  calibration  approaches  further en- 
able measurements  of resting-state  CMRO 2 in absolute  physiologic  units 
( Gauthier  and Hoge, 2013 ; Wise et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless,  in cBOLD 
experimental  preparation  for gas administration  and subject discomfort  
from the procedure  are limiting  factors.  Furthermore,  some of the as- 
sumptions  made in the calibration  model remain arguable  (e.g., Grubb’s  
constant  ( Chen and Pike, 2010 ) and isometabolicity  of gas challenges  
( Englund  et al., 2020 ; Peng et al., 2017 )). 
qBOLD is a calibration-free  technique  and instead  directly  quanti-  
ﬁes the two critical determinants  of the BOLD signal, i.e., deoxygenated  
hemoglobin  (dHb) concentration  in venous blood ([dHb] v = C a (1-Y v )) 
and deoxygenated  blood volume  (DBV). Under the static dephasing  
regime ( Yablonskiy  and Haacke,  1994 ), the qBOLD model character-  
izes the MR signal evolution  at short and long time scales, and partic- 
ularly for the latter the RF-reversible  portion  of the transverse  relax- 
ation rate (R 2 ′ ) is linearly  proportional  to the two parameters  (Y v and 
DBV). Thus, the qBOLD method  typically  acquires  R 2 ′ -weighted  time- 
series data and then attempts  to separate  measured  R 2 ′ into Y v and 
DBV. However,  conventional  qBOLD presents  two major problems.  First, 
on the data acquisition  side, currently  practiced  R 2 ′ mapping  methods  
( Ni et al., 2015 ), generally  referred  to as GESSE (gradient-echo  sampling  
of spin-echo)  ( Yablonskiy,  1998 ), GESFIDE  (gradient-echo  sampling  of 
free-induction-decay  and echo) ( Ma and Wehrli,  1996 ), or ASE (asym- 
metric spin-echo)  ( An and Lin, 2003 ), commonly  rely on the spin-echo  
mechanism  applying  a 180°RF  pulse. Thus, the utility of these methods  
has been largely limited to 2D quantiﬁcations,  and their extension  to 
3D qBOLD would entail impractically  long scan times for 3D encoding.  
Second,  from the parameter  estimation  perspective,  the qBOLD model 
presents  limited parameter  sensitivity  ( Lee et al., 2018 ; Sedlacik  and 
Reichenbach,  2010 ). Speciﬁcally,  mutual coupling  between  Y v and DBV 
in the signal model renders  the quantiﬁcation  error-prone  and unsta- 
ble, resulting  in relatively  low reproducibility  of the method.  Further-  
more, in the original  qBOLD model, contribution  of non-heme  iron to 
R 2 ′ is not accounted  for (i.e., the relative  magnetic  susceptibility  of ex- 
travascular  tissue is approximated  to that of fully oxygenated  blood ∼
-0.1 ppm ( Yablonskiy  et al., 2013a )), which may result in erroneous  es- 
timates,  particularly  in deep brain structures  presenting  susceptibility  
values higher on the positive  side (up to + 0.2 ppm ( Lim et al., 2013 )) 
due to high non-heme  iron content  in the basal ganglia.  
More recently,  an approach  combining  qBOLD and quantitative  
susceptibility  mapping  (QSM) has been suggested  (referred  to as 
qBOLD + QSM ( Cho et al., 2018 )). The method  employs  a 3D multi- 
echo spoiled  gradient-echo  (GRE) pulse sequence,  a typical choice in 
QSM for local ﬁeld estimation  by means of phase analysis  ( Wang and 
Liu, 2015 ), and utilizes  R 2 ∗ -weighted  magnitude  images for qBOLD pro- 
cessing.  Compared  to the original  qBOLD method,  the parameter  esti- 
mation model was modiﬁed  such that non-blood  tissue susceptibility  
( 𝜒nb ) was explicitly  included  in the temporal  signal decay while four- 
pool decomposition  of voxel susceptibility  ( Δ𝜒) (i.e., deoxygenated  ar- 
terial and venous blood, fully oxygenated  blood, and non-blood  tissue 
( Zhang et al., 2015 )) was added as a constraint.  It was shown that 
qBOLD + QSM with 3D multi-echo  spoiled  GRE achieves  rapid 3D qBOLD 
scanning  while reducing  noise sensitivity  in the parameter  estimation  
( Cho et al., 2018 ). However,  a more recent analysis  ( Hubertus  et al., 2019 ) has revealed  that qBOLD + QSM yields overall higher measure-  
ment accuracy  in gray matter regions  with GESSE than that obtainable  
with multi-echo  spoiled  GRE. This would have resulted  from the fact 
that, unlike GRE, GESSE is able to extract R 2 ′ directly  from signal decay 
curves. 
In this work, we aimed to address  the above noted challenges  
in 3D qBOLD parameter  mapping,  i.e., high-speed  scanning  and 
robust quantiﬁcation.  To this end, in the data acquisition,  a re- 
cently developed,  scan-time  eﬃcient  3D R 2 ′ mapping  pulse sequence  
( Lee and Wehrli,  2021 ), termed ‘Alternating  Unbalanced  Steady-state-  
free-precession  Free-Induction-Decay  and Echo (AUSFIDE)’,  was em- 
ployed,  while in the qBOLD processing  pipeline,  parametric  infor- 
mation obtained  from AUSFIDE  (R 2 , R 2 ′ , Δ𝜒, macroscopic  magnetic  
ﬁeld inhomogeneity)  was fully integrated  into a prior-constrained  non- 
linear inverse  problem.  Additionally,  venous cerebral  blood volume  
(CBV v ) was separately  measured  using an in-house  developed  method  
( Lee and Wehrli,  2020 ), termed ‘velocity-selective  venous-spin-labeling  
(VS-VSL),  serving  as prior information  for DBV. The obtained  Y v maps 
along with separate  CBF measurements  enabled  3D CMRO 2 mapping  
across the entire brain. Numerical  simulations  and in-vivo experiments  
were performed  to evaluate  the performance  of the proposed  qBOLD 
method  in comparison  to the existing  techniques.  
2. Methods  
2.1. AUSFIDE-based  3D qBOLD 
One key challenge  that currently  practiced  qBOLD techniques  face is 
separation  of the four competing  mechanisms  that aﬀect temporal  signal 
decays across echoes collected:  R 2 (microscopic),  R 2 ′ from heme (R 2 ′ ,h ) 
and non-heme  (R 2 ′ ,nh ) iron contributions  (mesoscopic),  and background  
magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogeneity  ( ΔB 0 ; macroscopic).  Further,  extracting  
Y v and DBV from the measured  R 2 ′ ,h is generally  nontrivial  as noted in 
Introduction.  The following  subsections  along with Fig. 1 detail the pro- 
posed approach  in terms of data acquisition  and parameter  estimation  
so as to disentangle  the above confounders  and thereby  achieving  reli- 
able measurements  of the qBOLD parameters.  Symbols  used to represent  
parameters  and their corresponding  descriptions  are listed in Table 1 . 
2.1.1. Estimation  of preliminary  parameters  
The proposed  3D qBOLD protocol  consists  of two pulse sequences:  
AUSFIDE  ( Fig. 1 a) yielding  a set of volumetric  maps (R 2 , R 2 ′ , Δ𝜒, ΔB 0 ; 
Fig. 1 c), and additionally  VS-VSL  ( Fig. 1 b) leading  to voxel-wise  CBV v 
estimates  ( Fig. 1 d) across the entire brain. 
Based on the unbalanced  steady-state-free-precession  (SSFP) mech- 
anism ( Scheﬄer,  1999 ) generating  steady-state  signals in a number  of 
spin conﬁgurations,  AUSFIDE  deploys  SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO  mod- 
ules in an alternating  and time-symmetric  fashion  along the entire pulse 
train ( Fig. 1 a) for selective  acquisition  of SSFP signals in the 0th and - 
1st spin pathways,  respectively,  with a plurality  of gradient-recalled  sig- 
nals within each time-of-repetition  (TR). The decay rate of SSFP-FID  and 
SSFP-ECHO  signals along time is then expressed  by R 2 + R 2 ′ ( = R 2 ∗ ) and 
R 2 -R 2 ′ , respectively,  while temporal  evolution  of signal phase therein  is 
governed  by magnetic  ﬁelds both at voxel and larger scales. Thus, AUS- 
FIDE enables  quantiﬁcation  of R 2 and R 2 ′ from magnitude  data process-  
ing ( Fig. 1 c), and Δ𝜒and ΔB 0 from phase analysis  ( Fig. 1 d) (see Eq. [2] 
below for signal modeling).  This is a key advantage  over the currently  
practiced  qBOLD pulse sequences.  On one hand, compared  to the 2D- 
limited R 2 ′ measurement  techniques,  AUSIFDE  achieves  rapid 3D volu- 
metric scanning,  thus allowing  for additional  estimation  of Δ𝜒via QSM. 
On the other hand, compared  to multi-echo  3D spoiled  GRE, AUSIFDE  
is able to separate  R 2 ∗ into R 2 and R 2 ′ contributions  directly.  Additional  
components  in the AUSFIDE  sequence  include  3D z-shimming  gradients  
along the multi-echo  train ( Han et al., 2015 ) and the radial stack-of-  
stars k-space  sampling  scheme  ( Block et al., 2014 ) so as to make the R 2 ′

‘Alternating  Unbalanced  Steady-state-free-precession  (SSFP) Free-Induction-Decay  and Echo (AUSFIDE)’  (a) and ‘Velocity-Selective  Venous-Spin-Labeling  (VS-VSL)’  
(b) pulse sequences.  In AUSFIDE,  the SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO  modules  alternate  with each other across the entire pulse train while sampling  multiple  echoes 
decaying  with rate constants  R 2 + R 2 ′ and R 2 -R 2 ′ , respectively.  The VS-VSL method achieves  ΔB 0 -resistant,  selective  labeling  of venous blood by applying  saturation,  
inversion,  and VS modules  sequentially  before 3D fast spin-echo  readout.  Step II. Prior estimation:  The AUSIFDE  data are processed  in magnitude  and phase, leading 
to maps of R 2 and R 2 ′ (c) and Δ𝜔 0 ( = 𝛾ΔB 0 ) and Δ𝜒(d), respectively,  while the diﬀerence  between  control and tag VS-VSL images approximates  CBV v (e). Step III. 
qBOLD parameter  mapping:  Given acquired  time-series  AUSFIDE  images and preliminary  parametric  maps derived therefrom,  along with CBV v prior information,  
the constrained  nonlinear  inverse problem  in Eq. [6] is solved, yielding  solutions  for qBOLD parameters  (DBV and Y v ) and nonblood  contributions  to R 2 ′ and Δ𝜒
(see main text for details).  
mapping  relatively  immune  to large-scale  magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogeneity  
and physiologic  bulk ﬂuid motion,  respectively  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2021 ). 
In the VS-VSL  pulse sequence  ( Fig. 1 b), two magnetization  prepara-  
tion modules  are sequentially  applied  to respective  spatial positions  to 
null signals for both upstream  arterial  blood and cerebrospinal-ﬂuid,  fol- 
lowed by a control/tag  VS pulse train to sensitize  moving  spins, thereby  
ensuring  labeling  of venous blood only. Subsequently,  single-slab  3D 
fast SE with variable  refocusing  ﬂip angles and center-out  k-space  view 
ordering  schemes  is employed  to achieve  rapid and ΔB 0 -insensitive  sig- 
nal readout  with a minimal  loss of the labeled  venous blood population.  
In the quantiﬁcation,  a simpliﬁed  VS-VSL  signal model yields CBV v di- 
rectly from control/tag  diﬀerence  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2020 ). 
2.1.2. Prior-constrained  qBOLD model 
In the absence  of blood vessel network,  the signal evolution  of SSFP- 
FID (S F ) and SSFP-ECHO  (S E ) modules  in AUSFIDE  can be written  as: 
{ 𝑆 𝐹 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )= 𝑆 0 𝑒 −( 𝑅 2 + 𝑅 ′
2 ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )𝑒 − 𝑗Φ
𝑆 𝐸 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )= 𝜂𝑆 0 𝑒 ( 𝑅 2 − 𝑅 ′
2 ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (−Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )𝑒 𝑗Φ(2) 
where the subscripts  F and E represent  SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO,  TE is 
the echo time, S 0 is the baseline  steady-state  signal level of SSFP-FID,  
𝜂is the ratio of S E to S F at TE = 0, F VSF is the voxel-spread-function  
representing  ΔB 0 -induced  voxel signal modulations  ( Yablonskiy  et al., 
2013b ), and Φis the signal phase as a function  of total magnetic  ﬁeld 
(i.e., ΔB 0 + Δ𝜒-induced  local ﬁeld). Given the estimates  of ΔB 0 and the resultant  F VSF , the unknown  parameters  in Eq. [2], S 0 , 𝜂, R 2 , and R 2 ′ , 
can be jointly estimated  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2021 ). 
In the presence  of a blood vessel network,  heme iron and non-heme  
iron both perturb  local magnetic  ﬁeld, altering  the transverse  relaxation  
rate R 2 ′ made up of R ′ 2,h + R ′ 2,nh . In the qBOLD framework  aiming to re- 
solve the dHb-related  R 2 ′ (R ′ 2,h ) into Y v and DBV, the two sources  of R 2 ′ 
modulation  thus needs to be separately  taken into account.  Accordingly,  
Eq. [2] is modiﬁed  to: 
{ 𝑆 𝐹 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )= 𝑆 0 𝑒 −( 𝑅 2 + 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝛿𝜔 ) 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )𝑒 − 𝑗Φ
𝑆 𝐸 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )= 𝜂𝑆 0 𝑒 ( 𝑅 2 − 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝛿𝜔 ) 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (−Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )𝑒 𝑗Φ(3) 
Here, the term 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓( ⋅) is the qBOLD model representing  the eﬀect of 
dHb on the extravascular  tissue signal, 𝜁is DBV, and f( • ) characterizes  
the rate of signal decay as quadratic  and linear functions  of its argu- 
ment asymptotically  at short and long TEs, respectively  ( Yablonskiy  and 
Haacke,  1994 ). 𝛿𝜔 is the characteristic  frequency  due to the susceptibil-  
ity of deoxygenated  blood relative  to the surrounding  tissue, expressed  
by ( Cho et al., 2018 ; Yablonskiy  et al., 2013a ): 
𝛿𝜔 (𝑌 𝑣 , 𝜒𝑛𝑏 )= 1 
3 𝛾𝐵 0 (Δ𝜒0 𝐻𝑐𝑡 (1 − 𝑌 𝑣 )+ 𝜒𝑏𝑎 − 𝜒𝑛𝑏 )(4) 
where 𝛾is the gyromagnetic  ratio, 𝐵 0 is the static ﬁeld strength,  Δ𝜒0 is 
the susceptibility  diﬀerence  between  fully oxygenated  and fully deoxy- 
genated  red blood cells ( ∼4 𝜋×0 . 27 ppm ( Spees et al., 2001 )), and Hct 
is the blood hematocrit  level. 𝜒𝑏𝑎 is the susceptibility  of fully oxygenated  
blood, which can be calculated  by volume-weighted  combination  of sus-

blob/main/individualization/Individualization.py  . 
2.4. Preprocessing  
We chose a preprocessing  pipeline  in accordance  with our previous  
work benchmarking  preprocessing  pipelines  in data from young chil- 
dren ( Graﬀet  al., 2022 ). All preprocessing  was carried out using custom  
Python scripts that integrated  Nipype  functionality  ( Gorgolewski  et al., 
2011 ) using FSL version  6.0.0 ( Smith et al., 2004 ), ANTs version  3.0.0.0 
( Avants et al., 2011 ), and AFNI version  18.3.03  ( Cox, 1996 ). We prepro-  
cessed scans from the same individual  separately.  
EPI data preprocessing  consisted  of slice time correction,  rigid body 
realignment,  and skull stripping  using FSL slicetimer,  FSL MCFLIRT,  
and FSL BET respectively,  a linear regression  to remove  the mean and 
linear and quadratic  trends from each voxel, bandpass  temporal  ﬁl- 
tering (0.01 –0 . 0 8 Hz), and nuisance  regression.  We regressed  out 
the six head motion parameters,  along with the white matter,  cere- 
brospinal  ﬂuid, and global signal; both linear and quadratic  terms were 
included,  along with their temporal  derivatives  (4 regressors  per param- 
eter). Censoring  was carried out as part of the regression  step, where 
we censored  volumes  above a FD threshold  of 0.25 mm (based on FSL 
MCFLIRT)  and censored  only the identiﬁed  frames.  After censoring,  our 
shortest  scan had 273 volumes;  for all other scans volumes  274 on- 
ward (of volumes  uncensored)  were removed  to match scan lengths.  
As not only amount  but location  of censored  volumes  inﬂuences  con- 
nectome  stability  ( Power et al., 2015 ), we carried out a control analy- 
sis using an alternate  volume-length  matching  approach  where the 18- 
minute scan was divided  into 4.5-minute  quartiles,  and for each par- 
ticipant  their 273 volumes  were chosen sequentially  from each quad- 
rant, from uncensored  volumes.  This allowed  a more even distribution  
of volumes  included  across the 18-minute  scan. We used ANTs Regis- 
tration ( Avants et al., 2011 ) to warp the EPI image to a study-speciﬁc  
2  K. Graﬀ, R. Tansey, S. Rai et al. NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119367 
EPI template  ( Huang et al., 2010 ). This template  was produced  by tak- 
ing a reference  volume  from each fMRI scan, chosen as a volume  of low 
motion approximately  in the middle of the scan, warping  these refer- 
ences to MNI space, then averaging  them together  and smoothing  with 
a Gaussian  kernel. We smoothed  the study-speciﬁc  template  with a ker- 
nel of 𝜎= 3.0 mm, as we found this kernel best addressed  the trade-oﬀ
between  retaining  anatomical  information  and compensating  for imper- 
fect registration  of the reference  volumes  to MNI space. Functional  data 
used in the analysis  were not spatially  smoothed  prior to connectome  
generation.  
2.5. Connectome  generation  
Following  preprocessing,  each voxel was assigned  to one of 1095 
nodes (parcels)  within the MIST ATOM parcellation  ( Urchs et al., 2019 ). 
We used the MIST parcellation  due to its inclusion  of subcortical  regions,  
including  the cerebellum.  Each node was assigned  to one of 12 brain 
networks,  as deﬁned  by the MIST 12 parcellation:  Basal ganglia  and 
thalamus  (for brevity,  hereafter  referred  to as BG/thalamus;  39 nodes),  
auditory  network  and posterior  insula (auditory  network;  49 nodes),  
mesolimbic  network  (153 nodes),  default mode network  lateral (lateral  
DMN; 48 nodes),  visual network  (110 nodes),  default mode network  
posteromedial  (posteromedial  DMN; 56 nodes),  somatomotor  network  
(53 nodes),  default mode network  anteromedial  and left angular  gyrus 
(anteromedial  DMN; 84 nodes),  ventral visual stream and dorsal visual 
stream (visual stream;  78 nodes),  frontoparietal  network  (157 nodes),  
ventral attention  network  and salience  network  (ventral  attention  net- 
work; 132 nodes),  and cerebellum  (136 nodes).  
The time courses  for voxels in each node were averaged,  reducing  
the brain to 1095 time courses.  The Pearson  correlation  between  every 
pair of nodes was calculated,  generating  598 965 edges, which were 
Fisher z-transformed  to approximate  a normal  distribution.  
2.6. Self-stability,  between-subject-similarity,  and individualization  metrics 
Fig. 1 summarizes  how metrics  were generated.  Following  the 
approach  used by Finn et al. (2015) and related work ( Byrge and 
Kennedy,  2019 ; Kaufmann  et al., 2017 ; Miranda-Domingeuz  et al., 
2018 ), connectomes  were vectorized  and then each pair of scans was 
correlated.  These correlations  were also Fisher z-transformed  prior to 
being included  in statistical  models.  Connectome  metrics  were then cal- 
culated  as follows:  
1 Longitudinal  self-stability  was assessed  as the correlation  between  a 
participant’s  original  and follow up scan. 
2 Average-between-subject-similarity  was assessed  using the mean of 
each participant’s  correlation  to all scans from other participants.  
Both original  and follow-up  scans were used to generate  this aver- 
age (i.e., for each participant,  this value is an average  of 2 ×144 = 288 
correlations).  We considered  original  and follow-up  scans separately  
in a second model (see 2.8 . below).  
3 Developmental  individualization  was assessed  through  two metrics:  
a The ﬁngerprinting  match rate was calculated  by comparing  each 
scan against  every other scan and dividing  the number  of times 
a scan’s highest  correlation  was to the other scan from the same 
participant  by the total number  of scans, expressed  as a percent-  
age. Here we had 73 individuals,  each with two scans, for a de- 
nominator  of 146. Although  this metric has been used widely 
( Finn et al., 2015 ), it reduces  each scan to a binary score (match 
or no match),  thus limiting  its sensitivity,  and is necessarily  af- 
fected by sample size, since the larger the sample the more likely 
a scan will be compared  to a very similar scan ( Waller et al., 
2017 ). To address  this, we implemented  an additional  metric: 
b The diﬀerence  between  longitudinal  self-stability  and average-  
between-subject-similarity.  This metric can be thought  of as the 
extent to which a participant  is individualized  relative  to the group. We used this as our main developmental  individualiza-  
tion metric. 
Self-stability,  average-between-subject-similarity,  and developmen-  
tal individualization  were calculated  for the whole connectome  (all 598 
965 edges) and for the edges within individual  networks.  To account  
for diﬀerences  in network  size (number  of nodes in each network),  we 
conducted  network  size-matched  control analyses  by randomly  choos- 
ing 36 nodes (chosen  as it was close to but smaller  than the 39 nodes 
in our smallest  network)  from each network  and only using the (630) 
edges between  those nodes, sampled  1000 times. 
2.7. Cross-sectional  age associations  
We used a linear regression  to assess associations  between  age 
and self-stability,  average-between-subject-similarity,  and developmen-  
tal individualization.  For age, we used the participants’  average  of the 
age at the time of their initial scan and age at their follow up scan. 
We also included  motion (mean relative  FD, averaged  across the two 
scans), time between  scans, and sex as covariates.  Age associations  were 
calculated  for the entire connectome  and individual  networks.  As de- 
scribed  above, we also conducted  analyses  controlling  for network  size. 
For network-wise  analyses,  we used Bonferroni  correction  for multiple  
comparisons  across networks,  and present  levels of signiﬁcance  both 
with and without  the correction.  Since diﬀerent  networks  may have dif- 
ferent distributions  in the metric of interest  (independently  of age), we 
calculated  standardized  beta coeﬃcients.  Figures  also include  95% con- 
ﬁdence  intervals  around beta estimates.  
2.8. Longitudinal-between-subject-  similarity  analysis  
To assess changes  in similarity  with age, in addition  to using average-  
between-subject-similarity  in a cross-sectional  model, which parallels  
the individualization  and self-stability  models (i.e., with one value per 
participant),  we tested a second model. For each participant,  we calcu- 
lated mean between-subject-similarity  for both baseline  and follow-up  
scan separately  (giving two similarity  values for each participant,  rather 
than –as in Section  2.7 –one similarity  value per participant).  We then 
used a mixed-eﬀects  model to test the eﬀect of age on similarity,  includ- 
ing motion and sex as ﬁxed eﬀects and participant  identity  as a random  
eﬀect. 
2.9. Short-term  split-half  self-stability  
To facilitate  comparison  to prior work ( Vanderwal  et al., 2021 ; 
Kaufmann  et al., 2017 ), we examined  associations  between  age and 
short-term  self-stability  using mixed-eﬀects  models.  Short-term  self- 
stability  was assessed  using split-half  correlations:  for each scan we cal- 
culated  the functional  connectome  for the ﬁrst and second half of the 
scan separately,  then correlated  the vectorized  edges and Fisher z trans- 
formed  the result. Models  included  motion (mean relative  FD) and sex 
as ﬁxed eﬀects and participant  identity  as a random  eﬀect. 
To address  whether  short-term  self-stability  age eﬀects were driven 
by response  diﬀerences  between  the ﬁrst and second half of the scan or 
potential  autocorrelation  eﬀects, we carried out an additional  analysis  
where we randomly  divided  scan volumes  into two halves, randomized  
1000 times. We found the average  randomized  split-half  stability,  before 
carrying  out the same mixed eﬀects analysis.  
2.10. Magnitude  of longitudinal  change 
If longitudinal  stability  increases  with age, this may be related to the 
average  change in edge strength  (functional  connectivity;  FC) decreas-  
ing, i.e., a slowing  of developmental  changes.  To assess this, we calcu- 
lated the magnitude  of longitudinal  change by averaging  across edges 
the absolute  edge diﬀerences  for each participant’s  scan pairs, both for

Fig. 1. Summary  of methods.  The MIST ATOM parcellation  was applied separately  to both scans from each participant,  then functional  connectivity  was calculated  
between  all 1095 connectome  nodes. The 598 965 edges were then converted  into a vector. Between  all pairs of vectorized  connectomes  - both within and between  
participants  - the Pearson correlation  was calculated  to assess similarity.  For each participant,  metrics of interest were generated  from these similarity  values. 
Longitudinal  self-stability  was assessed  as the correlation  between  a participant’s  original and follow up scan (in ﬁgure, blue striped box). Short-term  self-stability  
was assessed  by dividing  scans into halves, generating  the functional  connectome  for the halves separately,  then calculating  the similarity  between  these halves 
(split green-white  boxes). Between-subject-similarity  was assessed  using the mean of each participant’s  correlation  to scans from other participants  (pink boxes), 
either using all correlations  from both scan 1 and scan 2 (average-between-subject-similarity)  or determining  scan 1 and scan 2 mean correlations  separately  
(longitudinal-between-subject-similarity).  Developmental  individualization  was assessed  as the diﬀerence  between  longitudinal  self-stability  and average-between-  
subject-similarity  (brown box).

the whole brain and across networks.  We then used a multiple  regression  
to assess the eﬀect of age on magnitude  of longitudinal  change control-  
ling for motion,  time between  scans, and sex, identically  to other age 
models.  
2.11. Within- and between-network  eﬀects 
In an exploratory  analysis,  we considered  between-network  con- 
nections  for all pairs of networks.  We controlled  for network  size 
by randomly  choosing  18 nodes from each of the two networks  and 
only using the (18 ×18 = 324) edges between  those nodes, averaged  
over 1000 random  samplings.  In this analysis,  when assessing  within-  
network  we randomly  chose two sets of 18 nodes, giving an identi- 
cal 18 ×18 = 324 edges. Reported  p-values  are derived  from using 
the entire set of between-network  edges, rather than a random  subset. 
While we report p-values  with and without  multiple  comparison  cor- 
rection for transparency,  given the large number  of network-network  
pairs we caution  against  over interpreting  signiﬁcance  or lack of 
signiﬁcance.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(11483, 11511), match=' Data and code availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(13486, 13492), match='  \n3. '>"

work, we followed  the proposed  QIBA standard  and analyzed  the pre- 
cision of many quantitative  MR biomarkers  used in the Calgary  Norma-  
tive Study (CNS) ( McCreary  et al., 2020 ). Bias was not evaluated  as it 
requires  knowledge  of the true value which is unknown  for most in-vivo 
imaging  ( Bartlett  and Frost, 2008 ; Kessler et al., 2015 ; Nakagawa  and 
Schielzeth,  2010 ; Sullivan  et al., 2015 ). 
Precision  eﬀectively  determines  the threshold  (or minimum  de- 
tectable  diﬀerence)  by which a true change in the QIB can conﬁdently  be 
detected.  QIB precision  is assessed  by the consistency  of repeated  mea- 
surements,  and it is often expressed  as repeatability  and/or reproducibil-  
ity ( Kessler et al., 2015 ; Sullivan  et al., 2015 ). In longitudinal  studies,  
QIB repeatability  and reproducibility  must be known to detect meaning-  
ful changes  in the biomarkers.  For the purposes  of this study, repeatabil-  
ity is the consistency  between  repeated  measurements  made under near- 
identical  conditions  over time where the QIB is expected  not to change 
( Bartlett  and Frost, 2008 ). Under these assumptions,  the QIB variability  
is inherently  due to the measuring  method.  Conversely,  reproducibility  
is deﬁned  as the consistency  between  repeated  measurements  evaluated  
under diﬀerent  conditions,  such as changes  in acquisition  centre, scan- 
ner ﬁeld strength,  manufacturer,  sequence  parameters,  or time of mea- 
surement  ( Sullivan  et al., 2015 ). Under these conditions,  the QIB repro- 
ducibility  encompasses  both the measuring  method  and other changes.  
Precision  performance  metrics  can be reported  as a numeric  quantity  or 
as a scaled index ( Barnhart  and Barboriak,  2009 ; Sullivan  et al., 2015 ). 
Numerically,  precision  performance  is often described  by the within-  
subject standard  deviation,  the repeatability  coeﬃcient  and the 95% 
conﬁdence  limits of agreements  ( Bartlett  and Frost, 2008 ). Relative  mea- 
sures of performance  are usually  reported  via within-subject  coeﬃcient  
of variation  (CoV) ( Brandmaier  et al., 2018 ) and the intraclass  correla-  
tion coeﬃcient  (ICC) ( Koo and Li, 2016 ). 
Although  repeatability  and reproducibility  are recognized  as es- 
sential for QIB development  and implementation  ( De Guio et al., 
2016 ; Hagiwara  et al., 2020 ; Keenan  et al., 2019 ), few studies 
have addressed  simultaneously  the associated  variability  in struc- 
tural imaging,  MR relaxometry,  susceptibility,  diﬀusion,  and perfusion.  
Lee et al. (2019) found a consistent  bias across vendors  but a high re- 
peatability  in T1 measures  at 3 T in two diﬀerent  scanners.  As in pre- 
vious work, good intra- and inter-scanner  reproducibility  were reported  
using two diﬀerent  3 T scanners  of the same vendor at a single centre 
( Gracien  et al., 2020 ). Buonincontri  et al. found excellent  repeatability  
(CoV of ∼2.5% for T1, ∼7% for T2) and good reproducibility  (CoV of 
∼6% for T1, ∼12% for T2) using ﬁngerprinting  in single MR vendor at 
1.5 T and 3 T ( Buonincontri  et al., 2019 ). Lower within subject variabil-  
ity was found for T1, and T2 (CoV 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively)  in brain 
regions  using synthetic  MR techniques  ( Fujita et al., 2019 ). Prohl et al. 
( Prohl et al. (2019) ) showed  good inter- and intra-scanner  reproducibil-  
ity (CoV of",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5399, 5402), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(3696, 3699), match=' 3.'>"

Fig. 1. Parallel between  multivariate  decoding  and feature-reweighted  RSA (FR-RSA).  (a) Multivariate  decoding  in fMRI can be described  as a linear reweighting  
of features  (e.g. voxels) to optimize  the linear readout of a binary target variable  (e.g. stimulus  category).  Voxel weights reﬂect their importance  for the ﬁnal 
classiﬁcation  objective.  (b) In classical  RSA, no reweighting  is applied,  which assumes  that all voxels are equally important.  Relative  to multivariate  decoding,  this 
underestimates  the linear information  contained  in multivoxel  activation  patterns.  (c) FR-RSA utilizes linear feature-reweighting  in order to best reﬂect pairwise  
(dis-)similarity  relative to a target RDM or RSM, thereby improving  the use of multivariate  information  present in the data. 
Ramirez  et al., 2020 ; Bobadilla-Suarez  et al., 2020 ), much less em- 
phasis has been placed on the contribution  of individual  features  in 
the computation  of representational  (dis-)similarities.  In fact, most RSA 
approaches  assume  that each feature is of equal importance  and will 
thus contribute  equally  to the ﬁnal (dis-)similarity  estimate.  This ‘equal 
weights’  assumption  is at odds with the idea that for a given comparison  
of RSMs, some features  may carry more information  than others. This 
has several important  consequences.  First, for computational  models,  
classical  RSA may underestimate  the correspondence  between  the model 
and a given brain region, even though the model may already  contain  
the relevant  representational  space for capturing  the brain response.  
This may lead not only to suboptimal  model performance,  but may 
also aﬀect diﬀerent  models to diﬀerent  degrees,  which in case of model 
comparisons  may lead to the selection  of an inferior  model ( Khaligh-  
Razavi and Kriegeskorte,  2014 ; Peterson  et al., 2016 ; Jozwik et al., 2017 ; 
Storrs et al., 2021 ). Second,  for brain data, classical  RSA may overem-  
phasize  the importance  of individual  brain measurement  channels,  treat- 
ing noisy channels  (e.g. voxels) as equally  important  as channels  that 
carry signal. This contrasts  with the intuition  used in multivariate  lin- 
ear decoding,  where each voxel’s importance  is reweighted  according  
to the contribution  to the ﬁnal classiﬁcation  task ( Fig. 1 a). Surprisingly,  
reweighting  of individual  brain measurement  channels  is not routinely  
applied  to the measurement  of representational  similarities.  This sug- 
gests large untapped  potential  for improving  the representational  corre- 
spondence  between  computational  models,  brain activity,  and behavior  
( Fig. 1 b,c). 
The aim of the present  study is twofold.  First, for the reweight-  
ing of computational  model units, we seek to broadly  validate  the de- 
gree to which feature-reweighted  RSA (FR-RSA)  can act as a general-  
purpose  method  to relate representational  spaces of models to those 
of brain and behavior.  To achieve  this aim, we systematically  apply 
FR-RSA  to representations  from deep neural networks  (DNN) on the 
one hand and relate them to diverse  publicly  available  neuroimaging  
and behavioral  datasets  on the other hand. Second,  for the reweight-  
ing of brain measurement  channels,  we demonstrate  the broad applica-  
bility of FR-RSA  applied  to fMRI data —voxel-reweighted  RSA —for im- 
proving  the correspondence  between  representational  similarities  de- 
rived from the brain and from models or behavior.  Previewing  our re- 
sults, we ﬁnd that reweighting  units of a DNN reliably  improves  the ﬁt 
between  model, brain, and behavioral  RSMs and indeed aﬀects which 
DNN is selected  as the best model of brain activity  ( Storrs et al., 2021 ). 
This generalizes  the utility of FR-RSA  to a broad set of neural network  
models,  brain imaging  methods,  behavior,  and stimuli.  Further,  when 
reweighting  is applied  to fMRI voxels, our results demonstrate  consis- tent and pronounced  improvements  of RSM correspondence.  This sug- 
gests that feature reweighting  applied  at the level of brain measure-  
ments may act as a general-purpose  method  for improving  the repre- 
sentational  correspondence  between  brains, models,  and behavior.  To 
facilitate  future use of this method,  we provide  a toolbox  to run FR-RSA  
in Python (https://github.com/ViCCo-Group/frrsa),  with recommenda-  
tions regarding  implementational  choices.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Datasets  and computational  models 
We sought to evaluate  the general  applicability  of feature-  
reweighted  RSA (FR-RSA),  both when (1) reweighting  individual  units 
of a computational  model, as has been done previously  with similar ap- 
proaches  (e.g. Peterson  et al., 2016 ; Jozwik et al., 2017 ; Storrs et al., 
2021 ) and (2) when reweighting  measurement  channels  of brain data, 
an approach  which to our knowledge  has not been carried out before. 
To this end, we used datasets  from several published  studies in which 
participants  had been exposed  to a range of object images ( Mur et al., 
2013 ; Cichy et al., 2016 , 2014 ; Bankson  et al., 2018 ; Cichy et al., 2019 ). 
The datasets  are centered  around four sets of natural  object images and 
reﬂect a combination  of functional  MRI data, magnetoencephalography  
data, and behavioral  similarity  judgments.  In addition,  for the object im- 
ages, we extracted  neural network  activations  as computational  models.  
Together,  this makes these datasets  well suited for evaluating  FR-RSA  
across a wide range of possible  analyses.  One of the published  studies 
( Bankson  et al., 2018 ) used a twin set of 84 natural  object images,  which 
were tested in separate  sets of participants  and which we thus treated 
as two separate  datasets.  Another  image set ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008b ; 
Mur et al., 2013 ; Cichy et al., 2014 ) consisted  of 92 images of human 
and non-human  faces and bodies, as well as natural  and artiﬁcial  ob- 
jects. Finally,  another  image set ( Cichy et al., 2016 , 2019 ) consisted  of 
118 natural  images.  All datasets  used in this work were part of studies 
with approval  by their respective  local ethics committee.  Details regard-  
ing which kinds of data were available  for which image set, as well as 
the task carried out by participants,  can be found in Table 1 . 
2.1.1. fMRI data 
For the fMRI data associated  with two of the image sets (92 and 118), 
we used voxel-wise  beta estimates  for each object. These were provided  
with the publicly  available  datasets  and had been estimated  by applying  
a general  linear model to the preprocessed  data. The original  studies 
used a Siemens  3T Trio scanner  with a 32-channels  head coil and, for

Overview  over the datasets  used in this study. For each image set, data from several measurement  modalities  were available.  For fMRI, we focused on data 
from early visual cortex (EVC) and higher visual cortex (HVC). The number of participants,  n, for every measurement  modality  is stated in parentheses.  Note 
that not all available  datasets  from these image sets were used in all analyses,  given the exceedingly  large number of possible  comparisons.

applying  these models to neuroimaging  data, especially  for personal-  
ized medicine  in psychiatry.  In this context,  harmonization  methods  
Fortin et al. (2018) ; Garcia-Dias  et al. (2020) ; Kia et al. (2020) have 
emerged  to remove  this undesired  variability  from the data. However,  
such harmonization  models estimate  their parameters  on the entire 
dataset,  or at least, on a great portion  of it containing  all sites. It is also 
a limitation  in the context  of personalized  medicine,  where MRI data 
coming  from new hospitals  would mean to re-train  the whole model 
before making  a new prediction.  Besides,  these methods  are also sensi- 
tive to the number  of samples  per site as some statistics  (mean or vari- 
ance) are estimated  for each site separately.  Other recent approaches  
Bashyam  et al. (2020a)  ; Dewey et al. (2020) ; Liu et al. (2021) ; Liu and 
Yap (2021) ; Robinson  et al. (2020) are integrating  DL to perform  image- 
to-image  translation  (e.g style transfer)  in order to bring all images in 
a common  debiased  space. Validating  such approaches  is often diﬃcult  
and it either relies on travelling  patients  (scanned  at multiple  sites), 
which is very costly, or on statistical  analysis  on the generated  images 
(e.g using Fréchet  Inception  Distance  Liu and Yap (2021) ) or directly  
by demonstrating  that biological  variables  are well preserved  (e.g age 
or sex Bashyam  et al. (2020a)  ; Robinson  et al. (2020) ). Other line of 
work Dinsdale  et al. (2021) directly  tries to remove  site information  via 
adversarial  attack while training  an encoder  to predict the biological  
variable  of interest  (e.g age or sex). In that case, the validation  pro- 
cedure simply consists  in evaluating  the encoder’s  capacity  to retain 
biological  and site information.  All these approaches  use diﬀerent  val- 
idation procedure  and they are hardly comparable  to one another  (as 
they generally  do not even use the same datasets  and modalities).  
As a result, we propose  the OpenBHB  Challenge  on brain age pre- 
diction with site-eﬀect  removal.  This challenge  is based on the large- 
scale ( 𝑁 > 5000 ) multi-site  brain MRI dataset OpenBHB  that contains  
both minimally  preprocessed  data along with VBM and SBM measures  
derived  from raw T1w MRI. All images in OpenBHB  have passed a semi- 
automatic  visual quality check, and the data are publicly  available  on 
the online IEEE Dataport  platform  . The challenge  consists  in learning  
a representation  of the data such that i) brain age variability  is pre- 
served and ii) site-related  information  is removed.  The submitted  mod- 
els should output a vector representing  input data such that brain age 
can be easily predicted  (i.e. through  linear evaluation)  and acquisition  
site signal is absent (i.e. random  chance for predicting  site with linear 
evaluation).  Thus, this challenge  is closely related to several hot topics 
in ML/DL,  such as representation  learning  driven by a supervised  signal 
Dufumier  et al. (2021b)  ; Khosla et al. (2020) , debiasing  and trustwor-  
thy AI Bahng et al. (2020) ; Barbano  et al. (2021) ; Cadene  et al. (2019) ; 
Clark et al. (2019) ; Tartaglione  et al. (2021) . To evaluate  the submit-  
ted models,  we propose  a novel metric computed  on two test sets: an 
internal  test that contains  images from the same sites as training  and and 
external  test including  images from distinct  sites. We hope this challenge  
will facilitate  the benchmarking  of ML and DL models for both brain age 
prediction  and site-eﬀect  removal  through  a representation  learning  ap- 
proach.  
We plan to extend OpenBHB  with additional  subjects,  longitudinal  
data and other modalities  (e.g., resting-state  functional  MRI and diﬀu- 
sion MRI) that bring complementary  structural  and functional  informa-  
tion to the current  T1w images.  
In summary,  in this paper our main contributions  are: 
•OpenBHB,  a new large-scale  ( 𝑁 > 5000 ) brain MRI dataset publicly  
available  that includes:  
•preprocessed  quasi-raw,  VBM and SBM T1w data; 
•a visual quality check; 
•a training,  validation  and test splits used for the OpenBHB  chal- 
lenge; 
•a new challenge  for brain age prediction  with site-eﬀect  removal.  
•a leader-board  for the comparison  of submitted  models with a new 
metric. 
•an online platform  to submit the trained  models.  2. OpenBHB  dataset

OpenBHB  aggregates  10 publicly  available  datasets,  namely  IXI 1 , 
ABIDE 1 2 , ABIDE 2 3 , CoRR Zuo et al. (2014) , GSP Buckner  et al. (2014) , 
LOCALIZER  Orfanos  et al. (2017) , MPI-Leipzig  Babayan  et al. (2019) , 
NAR Nastase  et al. (2021) , NPC Sunavsky  and Poppenk  (2020) , and RBP 
Follmer  et al. (2018) ; Li and Clariana  (2019) . Currently,  OpenBHB  is fo- 
cused only on Healthy  Controls  (HC) since the main challenge  consists  
in modeling  the (normal)  brain development  by building  a robust brain 
age predictor.  As a result, we only included  HC from ABIDE 1 and 2, 
and we left out the subjects  with Autism Spectrum  Disorders  in the cur- 
rent release.  OpenBHB  contains  𝑁 = 5330 3D T1 brain MRI scans from 
HC acquired  on 71 diﬀerent  acquisition  sites with eventually  multiple  
acquisition  protocols  per site (see Table 1 ). As highlighted  in the map 
accompanying  Table 1 , the subjects  included  in OpenBHB  come from 
European-American,  European,  and Asian genetic  backgrounds,  promot-  
ing more diversity  in OpenBHB.  To manage  redundant  images,  one ses- 
sion per participant  has been retained  along with its best-associated  run, 
selected  according  to image quality.  We also provide  the participants  
phenotype  as well as site and scanner  information  associated  with each 
image, which essentially  includes  age, sex, acquisition  site, diagnosis  
(in our case only HC), MRI scanner  magnetic  ﬁeld, and MRI scanner  set- 
tings identiﬁer  (a combination  of multiple  information  composed  of a 
subset of the repetition  time, echo time, sequence  name, ﬂip angle, and 
acquisition  coil). Some widespread  confounds  are also proposed,  such 
as the Total Intracranial  Volume  (TIV), the CerebroSpinal  Fluid Volume  
(CSFV),  the Gray Matter Volume  (GMV),  and the White Matter Volume  
(WMV).  
The overall age and sex distributions  for OpenBHB  are plotted Fig. 2 . 
It should be noticed  that sex distribution  is globally  well balanced  for 
all age bins. Age distribution  contains  2 main modes centered  around 
10 years old (during  synaptic  pruning)  and 25 years old with a long tail 
above 40 until 88 years (and fewer samples  in this range). 
Additionally,  we performed  appearance  analysis  from VBM data, as 
it preserves  cortical  and sub-cortical  information  from raw images (as 
opposed  to SBM) and ROI measures  can be derived  easily to reduce data 
dimensionnality.  Speciﬁcally,  we represented  the t-SNE visualization  of 
ROI extracted  from VBM data in Fig. 3 per study. This plot clearly sug- 
gests that age and site eﬀect are driving  the representation,  thus justify- 
ing the objective  of the OpenBHB  challenge.  Datasets  with both a large 
number  of sites and a large age range cover wider regions  in t-SNE space 
than others (e.g CoRR covers almost all regions  while GSP and IXI cover 
only middle and upper regions;  even if they are lifespan,  they only in- 
clude 6 sites together  vs 18 sites for CoRR). This is even more obvious  
with MPI-Leipzig  that covers mostly small left and upper regions  while 
it is also lifespan.  
2.2. Preprocessing  and derived anatomical  features  
All data are preprocessed  uniformly  with container  technolo-  
gies comprising  quasi-raw,  CAT12 VBM, and FreeSurfer  (see 
Fig. 2.2 ), which allows us to control the diﬀerent  software  ver- 
sions over time. The project hosting  the codes is freely accessible  
at https://brainprep.readthedocs.io  . We conducted  a semi-automatic  
quality control (QC) guided with quality metrics  leading  to a selection  
of images that meet the quality criteria  for all three pre-processing  
pipelines  (see Fig. 5 and the detailed  QC per pre-processing  below).

Fig. 2. Demographic  description  of OpenBHB  (a) overall and (b) by study. Age histograms  show a peak distribution  for young adults (20–30 years old) with a 
long tail distribution  for older adults (60–80 years old). While age disparities  are observed  between  studies, the age remains  a poor site predictor  (see Table 3 ). All 
data-sets  are well-balanced  between  males and females.

Steps: Minimally  preprocessed  data were generated  using ANTS 
Avants et al. (2009) bias ﬁeld correction,  FSL FLIRT Jenkinson  and 
Smith (2001) with 9 degrees  of freedom  (no shearing)  followed  by aﬃne 
registration  to the 1 𝑚𝑚 3 MNI template,  and the application  of a brain 
mask to remove  non-brain  tissues in the ﬁnal images.  Quality control:  First, we computed  the correlation  between  each im- 
age and the mean of every other images in order to sort them by in- 
creasing  correlation  score. Then, images were manually  inspected  in- 
house following  this sorting and a ﬁrst threshold  was set to remove  
the ﬁrst 𝑘 images.  Additionally,  we used the average  correlation  (us- 
ing Fisher’s  z transform)  between  registered  images as a metric of

tor cortex, has been shown in one study to enhance  probabilistic  se- 
quence learning  performance  after targeting  the DLPFC ( Greeley  and 
Seidler,  2019 ); however,  opposite  eﬀects have been reported  in other 
studies ( Pesthy et al., 2017 ; Savic et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2015 ). 
In addition,  the DLPFC and its interactions  with the motor cortex 
were previously  investigated  at either the intra-hemispheric  or inter- 
hemispheric  level (rather than assessing  both levels) within single stud- 
ies ( Fujiyama  et al., 2016a ; Hasan et al., 2013 ). Moreover,  data inves- 
tigating  bilateral  DLPFC involvement  in inhibiting  or facilitating  corti- 
cospinal  neurons  after motor task performance  are scarce. Thus, there 
remains  a need to investigate  DLPFC plasticity  together  with DLPFC in- 
teractions  with the motor cortex in both hemispheres.  
According  to the model of brain dynamics  in motor sequence  learn- 
ing proposed  by Hikosaka  et al. (2002) , a sequence  of movements  is 
represented  in both a spatial coordinate  system and a motor coordinate  
system,  which correspond  to the main functions  of the DLPFC and M1, 
respectively.  Conceptual  models aﬃrming  the importance  of cognitive  
processes  in motor sequence  learning  suggest  that motor sequence  learn- 
ing involves  dual cognitive  processor  and motor processor  functions  
( Verwey,  1996 , 2001 ). Once participants  learn to associate  spatial cues 
with the pressing  of particular  buttons  in a speciﬁed  serial sequence,  
they exhibit faster response  times when the cues appear in sequence  
than when the cues appear in a random  order ( Willingham,  1998 ). For 
the present  study, we employed  a motor learning  task paradigm  called 
the serial reaction  time task (SRTT),  a four-choice  reaction  time task 
wherein  participants  were asked to learn a repeating  sequence  of button 
presses as fast as they can. The SRTT is a classic procedural  sequence  
learning  paradigm,  meaning  that it requires  a skill to be acquired  by 
practicing  a long sequence  embedded  in a stream.  Procedural  learning  
is a key means of achieving  high-level  motor skills ( Cohen et al., 1990 ; 
Robertson,  2007 ; Wilkinson  et al., 2015 ). 
Transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS) has been used in humans  to 
assess neurophysiological  responses  within non-motor  areas, and a dual- 
site paired-pulse  TMS technique  can be used to stimulate  the DLPFC 
immediately  prior to stimulating  the ipsilateral  or contralateral  M1 
( Ferbert  et al., 1992 ; Hasan et al., 2013 ; Ni et al., 2009 ). Thus, the dual- 
site paired-pulse  TMS technique  can be used to assess whether  excitabil-  
ity in M1 is enhanced  or inhibited  following  DLPFC activation  as well as 
to detect signs of corticocortical  interaction  plasticity  within the DLPFC 
following  motor sequence  learning.  
In the present  study, we sought direct evidence  of DLPFC–M1  plas- 
ticity changes  induced  by procedural  sequence  learning.  We conducted  
parallel  experiments  to investigate  procedural  sequence  learning–
induced  plastic changes  in interactions  of the left (L) and right (R) 
DLPFC with ipsilateral  and contralateral  M1 (L DLPFC–L  M1 and R 
DLPFC–L  M1 in experiment  1; and L DLPFC–R  M1 and R DLPFC–R  
M1 in experiment  2). The primary  aim of this study was to explore  
procedural  sequence  learning–induced  corticocortical  plasticity  in each 
hemisphere  of the DLPFC before and after participants  performed  the 
SRTT with their R (experiment  1) or L (experiment  2) hand. The DLPFC 
has inhibitory  inﬂuences  electrophysiologically  on both the ipsilateral  
and contralateral  M1 ( Ni et al., 2009 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). The DLPFC 
can send a faciliatory  output to ipsilateral  M1 during a motor selection  
task ( Hasen et al., 2013 ). In addition,  the L DLPFC–contralateral  M1 
interaction  is facilitated  during the preparation  of a bimanual  motor 
movement  ( Fujiyama  et al., 2016a ; Verstraelen  et al., 2020 ). Taking all 
this evidence  together,  we hypothesized  that DLPFC-induced  plasticity  
changes  aﬀecting  M1 would involve  a faciliatory  change in interactions  
that would induce lasting potentiation  of the motor output.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
A cohort of 60 right-handed  ( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ) participants  (mean 
age = 21.30 ± 2.00 years; 24 women)  with no history of neurological  or psychiatric  diseases  participated  in the study. Each participant  was 
involved  in only one of the two experiments  conducted  in this study. 
All participants  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and provided  
written  informed  consent  in accordance  with the Helsinki  declaration.  
This study, including  the TMS protocol,  was approved  by the ethics com- 
mittee of Shanghai  University  of Sport. 
2.2. Electromyographic  recordings  
Surface  electromyograms  were recorded  from the L and R ﬁrst dorsal 
interosseous  (FDI) muscle with 9-mm-diameter  Ag-AgCl  surface elec- 
trodes. The active and reference  electrodes  were placed over the FDI 
muscle belly and metacarpophalangeal  joint of the index ﬁnger, respec- 
tively. Ground  electrodes  were placed around the wrist and on the back 
of the hand to minimize  interference.  The signal was ampliﬁed  (1000 
×), bandpass  ﬁltered  (2.0–2.5  kHz; Intronix  Technologies  Model 2024F, 
Bolton,  Ontario,  Canada),  digitized  at 5 kHz by an analog-to-digital  
interface  (Micro1401;  Cambridge  Electronics  Design,  Cambridge,  UK), 
and stored in a computer  for oﬄine analysis.

Results of neuroimaging  datasets  aggregated  from multiple  sites may be biased by site-speciﬁc  proﬁles in par- 
ticipants’  demographic  and clinical characteristics,  as well as MRI acquisition  protocols  and scanning  platforms.  
We compared  the impact of four diﬀerent  harmonization  methods  on results obtained  from analyses  of cortical 
thickness  data: (1) linear mixed-eﬀects  model (LME) that models site-speciﬁc  random intercepts  (LME INT ), (2) 
LME that models both site-speciﬁc  random intercepts  and age-related  random slopes (LME INT + SLP ), (3) ComBat,  
and (4) ComBat with a generalized  additive  model (ComBat-GAM).  Our test case for comparing  harmonization  
methods  was cortical thickness  data aggregated  from 29 sites, which included  1,340 cases with posttraumatic  
stress disorder  (PTSD) (6.2–81.8  years old) and 2,057 trauma-exposed  controls  without PTSD (6.3–85.2  years 
old). We found that, compared  to the other data harmonization  methods,  data processed  with ComBat-GAM  was 
more sensitive  to the detection  of signiﬁcant  case-control  diﬀerences  ( X 2 (3) = 6",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(4472, 4475), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8465, 8467), match='3.'>"

The vervet monkey  from which the tissue originated  was cared 
for on the island of St Kitts and treated in line with a protocol  ap- 
proved by The Caribbean  Primate  Center of St. Kitts. The tissue was obtained  from the Montreal  Brain Bank and has also been studied  in

4. Results  
The Results section is organised  as follows.  First, we verify that it 
would be theoretically  feasible  to calculate  the diameters  of the XNH- 
segmented  axons by analysing  how SNR and gradient  strength  inﬂuence  
the upper and lower bounds  of measurable  diameter.  We proceed  to ver- 
ify the multi-shell  SMT-2 and PL descriptions  for diﬀerent  numbers  of 
shells, and investigate  the eﬀects of both Rican and Gaussian  distributed  
noise on the diameter  estimates.  The SMT-2 and PL formulations  im- 
plement  diﬀerent  assumptions  and degrees  of a priori knowledge.  We 
therefore  evaluate  whether  the assumption  of a known parallel  diﬀusiv-  
ity is valid, using both low and high 𝑏 -values.  Then, we present  segmen-  
tations of axons from the splenium  and a crossing  ﬁber region of the 
monkey  brain. In these, we investigate  the ability of the SMT-2,  SMT- 
3 and PL implementations  to estimate  the volume-weighted  diameters  
within real axonal geometries  for in/ex vivo diﬀusivities  and diﬀerent  
𝑏 − values, given by combinations  of diﬀerent  gradient  strengths  and dif- 
fusion times between  ∼1 0 − 40 ms.

Several  approaches  have been proposed  to explain  the map- 
ping between  structural  and functional  networks,  including  statis- 
tical associative  techniques  ( Mi š i će t al., 2016 ), biophysical  mod- 
els ( Breakspear,  2017 ; Deco et al., 2013 ; Honey et al., 2009 ; 
Robinson,  2012 ; Wang et al., 2019 ), structural  connectome  harmonics  
( Abdelnour  et al., 2014 , 2018 ; Becker et al., 2018 ; Rosenthal  et al., 
2018 ), network  communication  models ( Avena-Koenigsberger  et al., 
2018 ; Bazinet  et al., 2021 ; Goñi et al., 2014 ; Mi š i će t al., 2015 ), 
and deep learning  methods  ( Rosenthal  et al., 2018 ; Sarwar et al., 
2021 ). Among  these approaches,  those based on the eigenvectors  on 
the SC and network  communication  have attracted  mounting  interest  
recently  ( Abdelnour  et al., 2018 ; Atasoy et al., 2016 ; Becker et al., 
2018 ; Gabay et al., 2018 ; Surampudi  et al., 2018 ; Tewarie  et al., 2020 ; 
Wang et al., 2017 ). These approaches  incorporate  polysynaptic  com- 
munication  mechanisms  through  more than one structural  connection  
to account  for the ﬂow of information  between  not only directly  con- 
nected regions  but also intermediary  pathways  ( Atasoy et al., 2016 ; 
Seguin et al., 2020 ; Suárez et al., 2020 ). By working  on the structural  
embeddings,  network  communication  can be modelled  in a straight-  
forward  manner  based on random  walks on the SC ( i.e., signal dif- 
fusion through  the entire SC) or as combinations  of the structural  
eigenvectors  ( Tewarie  et al., 2020 ). As such, these techniques  allow 
for the modelling  of both mono- as well as polysynaptic  communica-  
tion mechanisms  to incorporate  increasingly  high-order  structural  in- 
teractions,  which may ultimately  reconstruct  a dense FC from a rel- 
atively sparse SC representation  ( Honey et al., 2009 ; Suárez et al., 
2020 ). 
Here, we propose  a novel approach  to predict FC from SC at the 
single-subject  level that models polysynaptic  signaling  mechanisms  via 
the diﬀusion  maps framework  ( Coifman  et al., 2005 ; Coifman  and La- 
fon, 2006 ). In particular,  we formulate  the problem  of predicting  FC 
from SC as a kernel fusion method,  where each kernel can be de- 
picted as a putative  intermediate  state while the brain is propagating  
information  through  the static white matter ﬁbers. These multi-scale  
diﬀusion  kernels  are implemented  as random  walks on the structural  
eigenspace,  by using the diﬀusion  maps framework  to identify  low di- 
mensional  components  describing  variance  in SC. As the length of the 
random  walks increases,  information  is propagated  through  increasingly  
longer indirect  paths. Since the functional  diﬀusion  coordinates  we at- 
tempt to synthesize  may have a diﬀerent  orientation  than their anal- 
ogous structural  coordinates,  we need a transformation  to align their 
low-dimensional  representations  in manifold  space. To do so, we for- 
mulate our task as a Riemannian  optimization  problem  over the product  
manifold  of rotations  ( Absil et al., 2009 ; Hu et al., 2020 ), where each 
rotation  is used to identify  the optimal  paths of a speciﬁc  length, and 
subsequently  build the corresponding  intermediate  diﬀusion  kernels.  Al- 
though polysynaptic  communication  mechanisms  are extensively  used 
to explain  FC, by learning  the rotation  matrices  in our approach,  in- 
formation  is not indiscriminately  spread through  the SC, but is rather 
propagated  in an informed  way through  the optimal  paths learned  from 
the training  data. The proposed  approach  is illustrated  in Fig. 1 . The 
workﬂow  was evaluated  on the prediction  of FC from SC at the indi- 
vidual level rather than group level. Results are reported  for two dif- 
ferent datasets,  namely:  326 unrelated  subjects  from the Human  Con- 
nectome  Project ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ) and 50 unrelated  subjects  
from the Microstructure-Informed  Connectomics  dataset ( Royer et al., 
2021 ). We used the proposed  approach  to: (i) study the relationship  
between  the length of the random  walks ( i.e., length of indirect  paths 
between  brain regions)  and prediction  accuracy  (quantiﬁed  via Pear- 
son’s correlation  coeﬃcient),  (ii) test the contribution  and identify  the 
weighting  schemes  to deﬁne the SC that best explain  the observed  
brain function,  (iii) perform  region- and network-speciﬁc  analyses  of 
FC prediction  as a function  of path length, and (iv) compare  the predic- 
tion performance  of the proposed  approach  with several state-of-the-art  
methods.  2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Datasets  
We evaluated  our proposed  approach  on diﬀusion  magnetic  reso- 
nance imaging  (dMRI)  and resting-state  functional  MRI (rs-fMRI)  data 
provided  by the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) repository  ( Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ), and on the Microstructure-Informed  Connectomics  
(MICs) dataset ( Royer et al., 2021 ). 
All MRI data used in this study were publicly  available  and 
anonymized.  For HCP, we used data from the minimally  processed  S900 
release.  Participants  who did not complete  full imaging  data and who 
had family relationships  were excluded,  resulting  in a total of 326 par- 
ticipants  (mean ± SD age = 28.56 ±",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5272, 5275), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(5617, 5620), match=' 3.'>"

( Tsvetanov  et al., 2021 ). Furthermore,  the slow haemodynamic  response  
means that fMRI is largely blind to neuronal  dynamics  above 0.1 Hz. 
More direct measures  of neural activity  can be obtained  by Elec- 
troencephalography  (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography  (MEG),  which 
measure  the electromagnetic  ﬁelds produced  by dendritic  dipoles  within 
active neurons  ( Hari and Puce, 2017 ; Stam, 2010 ). These can be sam- 
pled at a resolution  of milliseconds,  revealing  a rich repertoire  of neural 
dynamics,  including  oscillatory  rhythms  that occur at frequencies  be- 
tween 2 and 100 Hz, such as “alpha ”(8–12  Hz) and “gamma  ”(30 + Hz), 
some of which have also been implicated  in AD ( Engels et al., 2017 ; 
Giovannetti  et al., 2021 ; López-Sanz  et al., 2018 ; Mandal  et al., 2018 ; 
Osipova  et al., 2005 ; Stam et al., 2009 , 2006 ; Wang et al., 2017 ; 
Wiesman  et al., 2021 ). MEG oﬀers an advantage  over EEG in that the 
magnetic  ﬁelds are less distorted  and smoothed  by the brain-skull  in- 
terface than are electric  ﬁelds, resulting  in higher spatial resolution  
( Maestúet  al., 2019 ). We, therefore,  focus on MEG measures  of neural 
activity  (during  rest) to see if they provide  information  for MCI classiﬁ-  
cation that is complementary  to the structural  information  in sMRI. 
The general  advantage  of multimodal  integration  (combining  infor- 
mation from more than one neuroimaging  technique)  has been appre- 
ciated for many years, on the assumption  that each modality  reveals 
information  about somewhat  diﬀerent  aspects  of the underlying  neu- 
ral circuity  ( Engemann  et al., 2020 ; Henson  et al., 2011 ; Kumral  et al., 
2020 ; Nentwich  et al., 2020 ; Schouten  et al., 2016 ) and consistent  with 
ﬁndings  that combining  multiple  modalities  can improve  AD classiﬁ-  
cation ( Patel et al., 2008 ; Polikar  et al., 2010 ). For example,  using 
various  diﬀerent  machine  learning  techniques,  Patel et al. (2008) and 
Polikar  et al. (2010) have demonstrated  that combining  EEG and sMRI 
improved  diagnosis  of AD versus controls  compared  to using individual  
modalities  alone. However,  the EEG data in these studies were collected  
during an auditory  oddball  paradigm,  rather than the more common  
resting-state  used here. Colloby  et al. (2016 ) is the only study we could 
ﬁnd that combined  resting-state  EEG and sMRI, but they focused  on 
distinguishing  relatively  late cases of AD versus Lewy-body  dementia,  
rather than distinguishing  MCI versus healthy  controls,  as done here (a 
study by Farina et al. 2020 ). 
Neuroimaging  produces  many measurable  properties  (or “features  ”) 
from each participant,  such as ∼100,000  voxels in an sMRI image or 
∼1000,000  timepoints  in ∼300 sensors  in MEG, which normally  exceed 
the number  of participants  (typically  ∼100). Identifying  which features  
are important  for classifying  AD, therefore,  beneﬁts  from machine  learn- 
ing techniques  ( Wolfers  et al., 2015 ), such as kernel-based  approaches.  
A kernel is a square matrix containing  a measure  of the similarity  be- 
tween every pair of participants  in their feature values. Classiﬁcation  
based on kernels  rather than raw data is robust and eﬃcient  for high- 
dimensional  pattern  classiﬁcation  ( Schölkopf  and Smola, 2018 ; Shawe-  
Taylor and Cristianini,  2004 ). Here we used Multiple  Kernel Learning  
(MKL) ( Gönen and Alpayd ı n, 2011 ), which optimises  the weighting  of 
kernels  from each modality,  which is generally  better than simply con- 
catenating  features  across modalities,  particularly  when the modalities  
diﬀer in the number  of features  and/or those features  are incommensu-  
rate (such as volume  in mm 3 for sMRI versus magnetic  ﬁeld power in fT 2 
for MEG) ( Donini et al., 2016 ; Hughes  et al., 2019 ; Korolev  et al., 2016 ; 
Liu et al., 2018 ; Peng et al., 2019 ; Wee et al., 2012 ; Youssofzadeh  et al., 
2017 ; Zhang et al., 2011 ). Adding  kernels  to the classiﬁcation  model is 
also a better way to accommodate  potentially  confounding  variables  
(such as the age of MCI and Control  cases) than is the more com- 
mon approach  of ﬁrst adjusting  the data (features)  for those variables  
( Dinga et al., 2020 ; Snoek et al., 2019 ). 
Most importantly,  we compared  results from combining  modalities  
at three diﬀerent  stages: early, intermediate  and late ( Fig. 1 ). By Early 
combination,  we refer to the simple concatenation  of the features  of each 
modality,  after normalizing  them by their standard  deviation  across par- 
ticipants  (i.e., to unit-less  quantities  with comparable  numerical  range). 
By Intermediate  combination,  we refer to the typical MKL approach  of 
optimizing  the weighting  of kernels  derived  from the features  of each modality  (or confound).  By Late combination,  we refer to the applica-  
tion of MKL to kernels  derived  from the class predictions  after classiﬁers  
are run on each modality  separately.  The latter is closer to the “ensem-  
ble learning  ”philosophy  ( Kuncheva,  2014 ) and the “stacking  ”approach  
used by Engemann  et al. (2020 ). 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
We included  resting-state  MEG and T1-weighted  structural  MRI data 
from the BioFIND  dataset ( Vaghari  et al., 2021 ), which includes  individ-  
uals with Mild Cognitive  Impairment  (MCI) and Healthy  Elder Controls  
(HEC) from two sites: the MRC Cognition  & Brain Sciences  Unit (CBU) in 
Cambridge,  England,  and the center for Biomedical  Technology  (CTB) 
in Madrid,  Spain. The CBU controls  were recruited  from the CamCAN  
sample ( www.cam-can.org  ) who are screened  to be healthy,  i.e., have 
MMSE (and indeed ACE-R)  scores above conventional  cut-oﬀs,  as well 
as other screening  described  in CamCAN  paper ( Shafto et al., 2014 ). The 
CTB controls  had a full neuropsychological  assessment  to conﬁrm  nor- 
mal cognition,  and the same type of MRI assessment  as that done in the 
MCI group, i.e., a radiologist  reported  MRIs as normal.  
In general,  the MCI diagnosis  was determined  with the intermediate  
probability  according  to the National  Institute  on Aging–Alzheimer  As- 
sociation  criteria  ( Albert et al., 2011 ), i.e., given by a clinician  based 
on clinical  and cognitive  tests, self- and informant-report,  and in the ab- 
sence of full dementia  or obvious  other causes (e.g., psychiatric).  More 
speciﬁcally,  for the CBU data, individuals  were diagnosed  with MCI af- 
ter referral  for symptoms,  mainly memory  problems  (i.e., they were not 
derived  by screening  of cognitively  asymptomatic  people).  The diagno-  
sis was made in a regional  memory  clinic, including  ACE/ACER  and 
MMSE tests as standard,  with a signiﬁcant  deﬁcit in memory  domain  
tests. PET and ﬂuidic Biomarkers  were not used as standard,  although  
all had structural  brain imaging  (usually  MRI in the clinic unless con- 
traindicated,  when a CT is occasionally  used) and clinical  follow-up  in 
support  of the diagnosis.  By deﬁnition  of MCI, suﬀerers  had functional  
independence  at the time of diagnosis.  sMRI was used to exclude  other 
pathologies  and to identify  features  consistent  with MCI/AD  pathology  
(e.g. MTL atrophy  without  mass lesion, high vascular  burden).  
For the CTB data, the diagnosis  of MCI was based on criteria  from 
Frisoni et al. (2011 ). It was based on a mixture  of clinical  and quantita-  
tive approaches,  but MMSE score was not the sole criterion.  The diag- 
nosis required  an impairment  in the memory  domain  and/or other cog- 
nitive functions,  but a ""memory  complaint""  was not required,  so some 
participants  showed  awareness  of their cognitive  problems  and others 
did not. Indeed,  for CTB data participants  were not aware of their cur- 
rent cognitive  status. Therefore,  they did not have to show cognitive  
complaints,  but memory/cognitive  failures  were reported  by close com- 
panions.  The only biomarkers  used systematically  were brain morphol-  
ogy (from MRI) and APOE. As a requirement  for the diagnosis  criteria,  
MCI cases were able to still perform  their daily living activities.  MRI 
(T1, T2 and/or FLAIR) was used to rule out a vascular  disorder,  and any 
other type of neurological  disease  (i.e., tumor, stroke, infection)  that 
could better explain  the cognitive  symptoms.  
After excluding  15 cases without  an MRI, and 2 with MRIs with den- 
tal artifacts,  there were 163 HEC and 144 MCI datasets.  A summary  of 
sample characteristics  is reported  in Table 1 , which includes  variables  
that could aﬀect MCI status (such as education)  or could aﬀect brain 
activity  in general  (such as time of day of testing)  or could aﬀect the 
MEG data speciﬁcally  (such as head motion or distance  from sensors).  A 
small number  of missing  values were imputed  using the mean from non- 
missing  values for each variable:  5 missing  values for MMSE (1.5% of 
cases, all MCI), 12 missing  values for Education  (",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5210, 5213), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(9368, 9370), match='3.'>"

Levakov  et al., 2020 ; Bashyam  et al., 2020 ). Despite  these advan- 
tages, their complex  architectures  restrict straightforward  interpreta-  
tions of which image features  drive their estimates,  known as the black- 
box problem  ( Samek et al., 2019 ; Samek et al., 2021 ). Several  meth- 
ods have been proposed  to open the black-box  ( Samek et al., 2021 ), 
such as perturbation  and gradient  techniques  ( Baehrens  et al., 2010 ; 
Simonyan  et al., 2014 ; Zeiler and Fergus 2014 ; Sundararajan  et al., 
2017 ; Zintgraf  et al., 2017 ; Smilkov  et al., 2017 ), which also have been 
applied  for BA predictions  ( Levakov  et al., 2020 ). While many of these 
methods  highlight  input areas or intermediate  feature maps that are rel- 
evant for the prediction,  they do not indicate  whether  this information  
increases  or decreases  the predictor  output.  For the continuous  case of 
BA estimates  this means that neither  the pace of ageing processes  (i.e., 
DBA), nor the state of their progression  (BA) can be inferred  from com- 
puted saliency  maps. Conversely,  the Layer-wise  Relevance  Propagation  
algorithm  (LRP) highlights  relevant  areas in the input (image)  that both 
favour and dismiss  corresponding  output decisions  ( Bach et al., 2015 ; 
Montavon  et al., 2018 ; Lapuschkin  et al., 2019 ). LRP has been success-  
fully used with DL in MRI-based  classiﬁcation  tasks ( Böhle et al., 2019 ; 
Eitel et al., 2019 ; Thomas  et al., 2019 ). However,  the biological  alter- 
ations that underlie  ageing are continuous  in nature, which raises more 
challenges  for both the DL model, and, consequently,  its interpretation.  
Here, we therefore  aimed to provide  a novel, openly available  anal- 
ysis pipeline  extrapolating  from a proof-of-concept  simulation  study to 
the implementation  of superior  CNNs on multi-modal  MRI with the ex- 
planation  algorithm  LRP. Speciﬁcally,  we asked which neurostructural  
features  drive individual  predictions  and whether  BA truly captures  bio- 
logical ageing processes.  On a group level we explored,  how DBA is mod- 
ulated by cardiovascular  risk factors,  and how this relationship  mani- 
fests in distinct  neural features.  Based on previous  ﬁndings,  we hypoth-  
esized that BA relies on grey matter atrophy  which include  (pre)frontal  
and mesiotemporal  cortex and cerebellum,  and that risk factors such as 
obesity,  hypertension  and type 2 diabetes  correlate  with higher DBA, re- 
ﬂected in augmented  vascular  pathologies  such as a higher white matter 
lesion load. Importantly,  opening  the black box of DL image analysis  is 
expected  to reveal novel features  of MRI-based  neuronal  properties  that 
contribute  to BA estimates,  and thus advance  our knowledge  of brain 
health in ageing.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Data acquisition  
The LIFE Adult study ( Loeﬄer  et al., 2015 ), a population-based  co- 
hort study, encompasses  dense clinical  screenings  of more than 10,000 
participants  coming  from the area of Leipzig,  Germany.  Among  oth- 
ers, the screening  included  measures  of height, weight,  blood pressure,  
blood-based  biomarkers,  cognitive  performance  and questionnaire  bat- 
teries on mental health, and lifestyle  (for more details see: Loeﬄer  et al., 
2015 ). 
2.1.1. Study sample and exclusion  criteria 
Of the more than 10,000 subjects  of the LIFE Adult study, 2637 par- 
ticipants  underwent  a 1-hour MRI recording  session at baseline.  Of those 
participants  with MR-scans,  621 participants  were excluded  mainly due 
to pathologies,  leaving  2016 subjects  for further analysis  (age range 
18–82 years, mean age = 57.32, median  age = 6",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5206, 5209), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(3990, 3992), match='3.'>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119652,"2. We analyzed  ERPs to T2 stimuli inside (short lag) and outside (long lag) the AB window  after carefully  calibrating  T2 stimuli 
to ensure equal visibility  ratings across lags. We found that the N170, the visual awareness  negativity  (VAN), and the P3b showed an increased  amplitude  for seen 
compared  to unseen face stimuli regardless  of stimulus  lag and that all these components  scale linearly with subjective  visibility.  These ﬁndings  suggest similar early 
and late mechanisms  of graded perceptual  awareness  within and outside the AB across perceptual  (N170, VAN) and post-perceptual  (P3b) processing  stages. 
1. Introduction  
The neural correlates  of consciousness  (NCC) have been deﬁned  as 
“the minimum  neural mechanisms  jointly suﬃcient  for any one spe- 
ciﬁc conscious  experience  ”( Koch et al., 2016 ). Over the last years, NCC 
and the question  of how a stimulus  enters consciousness  have been 
the object of a broad debate (e.g., Aru et al. 2012 , Koch et al. 2016 , 
Lamme  2018 , Morales  and Lau 2020 , Tononi and Koch 2008 ). One 
of the most frequently  used paradigms  to investigate  the NCC is the 
Attentional  Blink (AB), where two targets are rapidly  presented  in a 
stream of distractors,  each stimulus  lasting about 100 ms. Here, the 
processing  of the ﬁrst target (T1) leads to a ""blink"" of attention  and 
thus to unawareness  for a second target (T2) if it is presented  within 
200–500  ms after T1 ( Broadbent  and Broadbent,  1987 ; Chun and Pot- 
ter, 1995 ; Raymond  et al., 1992 ), henceforth  referred  to as the AB win- 
dow. The temporal  distance  between  T1 and T2 is typically  described  
as lag N, meaning  that the T2 is the N th stimulus  after T1. Several  au- 
thors propose  that early processing  of blinked  stimuli is not aﬀected  
( Breitmeyer,  2015 ; Harris et al., 2013 ; Luck et al., 1996 ; Sergent  et al., 
2005 ; Shapiro  et al., 1997 ), suggesting  a late locus of processing  im- 
pairments  (but see Eiserbeck  et al., 2021 ; Luo et al., 2010 ; Slagter et al., 
2016 ). 
Electrophysiological  studies provided  conﬂicting  outcomes  regard-  
ing which event-related  potential  (ERP) components  are the ear- 
liest to be modulated  by AB eﬀects. While no studies report P1 
eﬀects of awareness,  there are mixed results for the N1/N170  
stage, even though most studies did not ﬁnd awareness  eﬀects 
( Dell’Acqua  et al., 2014 ; Harris et al., 2013 ; Koivisto  and Revon-

1998 ; Luo et al., 2010 ; but see Eiserbeck  et al., 2021 and Meijs et al., 
2018 ). In contrast  to early ERP components,  there is more reliable  
evidence  for visibility  eﬀects during intermediate  (e.g., N2, N4, vi- 
sual awareness  negativity  (VAN); e.g., Batterink  et al. 2010 , Koivisto  
and Revonsuo  2008 , Lasaponara  et al. 2015 , Sergent  et al. 2005 ) 
and late processing  stages (P3; e.g., Dell’Acqua  et al. 2014 , 
Harris et al. 2013 , Kranczioch  et al. 2003 , 2007 , Lasaponara  et al. 2015 , 
Meijs et al. 2018 , Sergent  et al. 2005 , Vogel et al. 1998 ) in AB 
experiments.  
Especially  the so-called  Visual Awareness  Negativity  (VAN), a neg- 
ative ERP diﬀerence  between  aware and unaware  trials starting  about 
200 ms after stimulus  presentation  over occipital  and posterior  elec- 
trodes, is the most reliable  and earliest  NCC candidate  ( Dellert et al., 
2021 ; Eklund and Wiens, 2018 ; Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2010 ; Shafto 
and Pitts, 2015 ). Increased  negativities  within the VAN time window,  
(even though the label of this activation  diﬀers, e.g. N2) for seen vs. 
unseen trials have been reported  during the AB ( Eiserbeck  et al., 2021 ; 
Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2008 ; Lasaponara  et al., 2015 ; Meijs et al., 2018 ; 
Sergent  et al., 2005 ) and other designs  such as inattentional  blindness  
(e.g. Shafto and Pitts 2015 ) and occur independently  of task-relevance  
of stimuli ( Dellert et al., 2021 ; Koivisto  et al., 2016 ; Schlossmacher  et al., 
2020 ; Shafto and Pitts, 2015 ). The VAN seems to support  theories  such 
as the recurrent  processing  theory (RPT; Lamme,  2003 , 2006 , 2010 ), 
which suggest  that visual consciousness  emerges  in occipitotemporal  
cortical  areas at relatively  early stages of processing  ( Koch et al., 2016 ; 
Boly et al., 2017 , Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2010 ; Railo et al., 2011 ; 
Förster et al., 2020 ).

While these studies might support  speciﬁc  theoretical  accounts,  it is 
important  to consider  that the contrast  of aware and unaware  trials does 
not unequivocally  reveal NCC that directly  correspond  to the conscious  
percept:  they may alternatively  or additionally  reﬂect prerequisites  or 
consequences  of consciousness  ( Aru et al., 2012 ). However,  these results 
allow specifying  further experiments  and hypotheses  that might lead to 
a causal inference  of the neural basis of consciousness.  
Furthermore,  several ﬁndings  of previous  AB studies ( Sergent  et al., 
2005 ; Sergent  and Dehaene,  2004 ) have been interpreted  in the context  
of the global neural workspace  theory (GNWT;  Dehaene  et al., 1998 ). 
This theory states that consciousness  is the result of recurrent  long- 
distance  processing  between  sensory  and (fronto-)parietal  brain regions,  
the so-called  global workspace""  ( GW ; Baars, 1997 , 2005 ; Baars et al., 
1998 ). It is assumed  that once a stimulus  ignites this long-range  global 
interaction  between  prefrontal  and parietal  loops, it becomes  an object 
of in-depth  processing  allowing  consolidation,  consciousness,  and ac- 
cess to verbal report. Especially  the P3b has been assumed  to reﬂect 
this ""all-or-none""  ignition  process  ( Mashour  et al., 2020 ; Sergent  et al., 
2005 ; Sergent  and Dehaene,  2004 ). However,  in contrast  to the VAN, the 
P3b is now believed  to reﬂect mainly post-perceptual  processing  asso- 
ciated with task relevance  of stimuli ( Cohen et al., 2020a ; Dellert et al., 
2021 ; Pitts et al., 2014 , 2014 ; Schlossmacher  et al., 2020 ; Shafto and 
Pitts, 2015 ; Ye and Lyu, 2019 ). Furthermore,  even though there is some 
evidence  for an all-or-none  ignition  account  in the AB ( Asplund  et al., 
2014 ; Dehaene  et al., 2003 ; Sergent  et al., 2005 ; Sergent  and De- 
haene, 2004 ; Tang et al., 2019 ), there is also counterevidence  for 
a graded transition  between  non-conscious  and conscious  processing  
when using suited scales ( Eiserbeck  et al., 2021 ; Förster et al., 2020 ; 
Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2010 ; Railo et al., 2011 ). Furthermore,  the P3 
amplitude  has been shown to correlate  with the level of consciousness  
in the AB ( Lasaponara  et al., 2015 ), suggesting  even for this component  
a deviation  from the all-or-none  hypothesis.  
Other recent studies found that consciously  perceived  targets out- 
side the AB window  inﬂuence  the detection  of T2s inside the AB in 
a probabilistic  nature ( Lasaponara  et al., 2015 ; Meijs et al., 2018 ). In 
these studies awareness  was assessed  in an all-or-non  fashion.  This type 
of response  measurement  leaves the question  open whether  probabilis-  
tic enhancement  aﬀected  the frequency  of perception  in an all-or-none  
framework  or gradually  aﬀected  awareness,  which was then mapped  on 
a dichotomous  response  scheme.  
Thus, a further systematic  investigation  of the (non)graded  nature 
of NCC across experimental  conditions  is strongly  needed  and would be 
important,  at least for the GNWT,  whereas  RPT makes no precise predic- 
tions. In early versions  of the theory, consciousness  was formalized  as 
a dichotomous  phenomenon  ( Lamme,  2004 ). However,  more recently,  
it has been acknowledged  that several aspects  can modulate  the depth 
and path of the initial dynamic  feedforward  sweep (e.g., stimulus  prop- 
erties, salience,  temporal  and focused  attention,  task sets, expectation,  
brain state, etc.; Lamme,  2018 ). 
As outlined  above, there is substantial  heterogeneity  in previous  ERP 
ﬁndings  related to NCC during the AB, especially  regarding  the N1/170  
stage and the question  of graded NCC, and systematic  studies with large 
samples  are needed.  From a theoretical  point of view, it is vital to 
understand  better the role of diﬀerent  ERP components  in the transi- 
tion of stimuli into consciousness  depending  on speciﬁc  experimental  
conditions.  Diﬀerent  NCC for diﬀerent  experimental  procedures  would 
indicate  shortcomings  of any generalized  theory of perceptual  aware- 
ness. While we ( Dellert et al., 2021 ) and others ( Navajas  et al., 2013 ; 
Reiss and Hoﬀman,  2007 ; Rodríguez  et al., 2012 ; Shafto and Pitts, 2015 ; 
Suzuki and Noguchi,  2013 ) found that awareness  eﬀects for faces started 
in the N170 time window  using other experimental  procedures  than the 
AB, a direct comparison  between  AB and non-AB  methods  is missing.  
Given the AB paradigm’s  inﬂuence  on our interpretation  of NCC and 
theories  such as the global workspace  theory that assumes  late NCC to 
appear in an “all-or-none  fashion  ”, it is of great relevance  to investi-  
gate both the chronometry  of NCC and the (absence  of) linearity  of the NCC using suited designs  and large samples.  Furthermore,  comparative  
studies are needed  to understand  better whether  NCC are speciﬁc  to 
AB-related  phenomena  (for example  rather “late ”, rather “all-or-none  ”) 
or are generalizable  to other experimental  designs.  One possibility  is 
to compare  the NCC within the AB and outside  the AB. While several 
ERP studies presented  stimuli in- and outside  the critical AB window  
( Batterink  et al., 2010 ; Harris et al., 2013 ; Lasaponara  et al., 2015 ; 
Meijs et al., 2018 ; Vogel et al., 1998 ), they typically  did not contrast  seen 
and unseen T2s presented  outside  the window.  Classically,  the factor 
lag was used to manipulate  the degree of awareness  ( Vogel et al., 1998 ) 
and no further separation  of seen and unseen trials was performed.  In 
more recent studies,  seen and unseen trials were compared  within the 
AB but not outside  the AB due to an insuﬃcient  number  of unseen T2 
( Harris et al., 2013 ; Lasaponara  et al., 2015 ). However,  this comparison  
can be achieved  by limiting  perception  outside  the AB by other means 
than attention  such as reducing  stimulus  contrast.  
The present  study investigated  diﬀerent  ERP components  to detected  
and undetected  face stimuli within and outside  the AB window  to ad- 
dress these questions.  We used faces as T2 stimuli,  as electrophysiologi-  
cal correlates  of face processing  in the AB ( Luo et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 
2015 ) are already  well explored,  and faces allow us to investigate  dif- 
ferent well-described  ERP components.  
We calibrated  stimulus  contrasts  per lag to match the distribution  
of visibility  ratings across trials inside and outside  the AB window.  To 
ensure an accurate  trial-by-trial  assessment  of the subjective  aware- 
ness of our subjects,  we used the Perceptual  Awareness  Scale (PAS; 
Sandberg  and Overgaard,  2015 ). In contrast  to other studies using this 
scale for faces presented  in an AB design ( Eiserbeck  et al., 2021 ), we 
adjusted  the labels of the scale based on pilot measurements  to increase  
their validity  (see Method).  This procedure  allowed  us to compare  NCC 
due to a lack of attentional  resources  during the critical AB window  with 
NCC outside  the AB, in which the sensory  strength  of stimuli was re- 
duced without  confounding  this comparison  by diﬀerences  in frequency  
of seen and unseen trials. Furthermore,  based on a suited scale, we inves- 
tigated whether  ﬁndings  were related to graded perceptual  awareness.  
Based on the literature,  we hypothesized  a main eﬀect of detection,  re- 
gardless  of lag, on the VAN and the P3b, but no eﬀect on the P1. While 
eﬀects of the AB on ERPs during the N170 windows  are mixed, face per- 
ception  studies that used other designs  than the AB reported  increased  
N170 to detected  vs. undetected  stimuli.  Based on these outcomes  and 
the large sample of our study, we expected  that awareness  eﬀects start 
in the N170 window  and can be observed  regardless  of lag. We further 
assumed  that NCC scale linearly  given our analytical  procedures,  which 
included  a suited modiﬁed  scale to investigate  the graded nature of con- 
sciousness.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Fifty-six  healthy  volunteers  (38 female,  18 male) participated  in the 
electroencephalography  (EEG) experiment.  We did not perform  a sam- 
ple size calculation  a priori because  power estimates  based on previous  
studies were deemed  too unreliable.  Furthermore,  explorative  analyses  
were based on a post-hoc  split of an unknown  distribution  of ratings 
across levels of perceptual  awareness.  Thus, we made a conservative  es- 
timate of our statistical  power and aimed at recording  50 participants,  
i.e., about two to three times the sample size of comparable  studies 
( Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2008 ; Luo et al., 2010 ). Six additional  sub- 
jects were recorded  to compensate  for technical  problems  (see below).  
All participants  were right-handed,  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  
vision, and had no history of neurological,  cardiovascular,  and psychi- 
atric diseases  or structural  brain anomalies.  Participants  were excluded  
when the T1 criteria  ( > 70% correct identiﬁcation  over all runs) or the

used in accelerated  acquisitions  brings with it a ﬁxed penalty  of de- 
creased  signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR), and high acceleration  factors can 
introduce  severe artifacts  even with modern  receive  coil arrays, there- 
fore acceleration  alone cannot fully remove  the distortion  in EPI. For 
this reason,  EPI distortion  must be addressed  in post processing.  Con- 
ventionally,  post-hoc  correction  of the geometric  distortion  is performed  
based on an estimation  of the voxel shifts induced  by the B 0 magnetic  
ﬁeld inhomogeneity  during the image acquisition,  where the ﬁeld oﬀ- 
sets can be calculated  from a separately  acquired  B 0 map ( Jezzard  and 
Balaban,  1995 ). Another  approach  is based on the “reversed  gradient  ”
method  that, instead  of using an explicit  B 0 ﬁeld map, infers the distor- 
tion using a pair of two EPI scans acquired  with the phase-encoding  gra- 
dients played out with opposite  polarities,  resulting  in two images with 
equal magnitudes  of distortion  but in opposite  directions,  from which 
non-linear  image registration  can be used to simultaneously  estimate  
and correct the distortion  ( Andersson  et al., 2003 ; Bowtell  et al., 1994 ; 
Chang and Fitzpatrick,  1992 ; Holland  et al., 2010 ; Morgan  et al., 2004 ). 
While distortion  in the phase-encoding  and frequency-encoding  di- 
rections  have been thoroughly  considered  in previous  work, the distor- 
tion in the slice-encoding  direction  for 2D slice-by-slice  imaging  has un- 
til now received  little attention  ( Studholme  et al., 2000 ), but is becoming  
more important  as it may be increasingly  present  in modern  MRI appli- 
cations.  For example,  high-resolution  (sub-millimeter)  fMRI uses thin 
imaging  slices which are usually  acquired  by maximizing  slice-select  
gradient  strength;  however  once the maximum  strength  is reached,  a 
decrease  of the slice-encoding  gradient  bandwidth  is required  to fur- 
ther narrow  the range or excited  frequencies,  which could lead to the 
additional  geometric  distortions  and “slice bending  ”in the slice direc- 
tion. For conventional  slice-selective  pulses, slice thickness  (TH) is de- 
termined  by the slice-encoding  gradient  strength  (G z ) and slice-select  RF 
pulse bandwidth  (BW) such that TH = BW/ 𝛾G z . While the value of G z is 
usually  dictated  by the desired  slice thickness,  the RF pulse bandwidth  
is related to the pulse duration  ( D ) and the time-bandwidth  product  
(TBW),  i.e., TBW ≡D ⋅BW. In sub-millimeter  imaging,  because  G z typ- 
ically cannot be further increased,  the slice thickness  can be decreased  
by modifying  the RF pulse design either by reducing  TBW (which leads 
to degradation  of the slice proﬁle),  or by increasing  the pulse duration  
(which lowers SAR but increases  the minimal  echo time, TE). Thus, to 
decrease  slice thickness,  often one must resort to reducing  the RF ex- 
citation  pulse bandwidth.  While stronger  gradient  coils help to achieve  
distortion-free  thin slices, they bring a penalty  of increased  peripheral  
nerve stimulation  and potential  eddy currents.  High-resolution  fMRI 
is commonly  performed  at ultra-high  magnetic  ﬁeld strengths  ( ≥ 7 T) 
where susceptibility-induced  B 0 ﬁeld inhomogeneities  are stronger  than 
at conventional  ﬁeld strengths,  suggesting  that this imaging  modality  
may be particularly  vulnerable  to slice distortion.  In addition,  in many 
applications  a low slice-select  RF pulse bandwidth  may also be desirable  
to decrease  power deposition  (SAR). Slice distortion  due to ﬁeld inho- 
mogeneity  has previously  been reported  in MRI studies conducted  using 
conventional  ﬁeld strengths  as well (such as 1.5 T) ( Sumanaweera  et al., 
1993 ) and in the presence  of metal implants  where magnetic  suscepti-  
bility oﬀsets are substantially  higher than those between  diﬀerent  tissue 
types ( Hargreaves  et al., 2011 ; Hopper  et al., 2006 ; Lu et al., 2009 ). 
To characterize  this slice distortion  and present  a method  for cor- 
recting it, here we use a novel acquisition  that acquires  pairs of im- 
ages with reversed  polarity  of the slice-encoding  gradient  to create im- 
age pairs with equal slice distortions  in opposing  directions,  and then 
demonstrate  that typical 7T fMRI acquisitions  do suﬀer from noticeable  
geometric  distortion  in the slice-encoding  direction,  which will result 
in alignment  errors when registering  these data to other datasets,  e.g., 
to anatomical  reference  data typically  acquired  using 3D encoding.  Our 
method  is analogous  to the reversed-gradient  method  used for remov- 
ing distortion  in the phase-encoding  or frequency-encoding  directions,  
and here it is applied  in the slice-encoding  direction.  We demonstrate  a 
correction  of these slice distortions  with our method,  and evaluate  it us- 
ing both spin-echo  (SE) or gradient-echo  (GE) based data acquired  with slice gradients  and RF pulse (excitation  and refocusing)  bandwidths  that 
are matched  those used in the target fMRI protocol.  Because  we use, for 
correction,  the popular  topup method  implemented  in the FSL package  
( Andersson  et al., 2003 ; Smith et al., 2004 ), we have named our method  
overeasy  ( Blazejewska  et al., 2017 ). While we demonstrate  our approach  
using high-resolution  EPI data, it is applicable  to any 2D multi-slice  data 
suﬀering  from geometric  distortion  in the slice direction,  which becomes  
more pronounced  at higher spatial resolutions  and higher magnetic  ﬁeld 
strengths.  
2. Materials  and methods  
Seven healthy  volunteers  (4F/3M,  26 ± 7 y.o.) participated  in this 
study after providing  written  informed  consent  in accordance  with our 
institution’s  Human  Research  Committee;  the study protocol  was ap- 
proved by the Institutional  Review  Board of Massachusetts  General  Hos- 
pital. 
All data were acquired  on a whole-body  7T scanner  (MAGNETOM,  
Siemens  Healthcare,  Erlangen,  Germany)  equipped  with a “short-z  FOV ”
body gradient  coil (SC72) and an inhouse-built  32-channel  coil array for 
receive  and a single-channel  birdcage  coil for transmit  ( Keil et al., 2010 ). 
During each experimental  session multiple  EPI scans were acquired  fol- 
lowing standard  automatic  B 0 shimming.  
The overeasy  method  used in this study consists  of acquiring  pairs 
of EPI data with reversed  slice-select  gradient  polarity,  with appropri-  
ate shifting  of the RF pulse center frequency,  which causes the voxel 
displacement  direction  to alternate  between  the two acquisitions,  as il- 
lustrated  in Fig. 1 . Note that the images were not acquired  purely ax- 
ially, and were tilted somewhat  to be roughly  aligned  to the brain’s 
AC-PC axis, therefore  the slice-select  gradient  was not along a single 
gradient  axis thus the gradient  was a combination  of the physical  G x , 
G y and G z gradients.  Because  the only parameter  to change between  
this pair of images is the slice-select  gradient  polarity,  the diﬀerential  
distortion  between  these images is in the direction  perpendicular  to the 
slice plane. Because  these two images are acquired  immediately  after 
one another,  we assume  that the B 0 inhomogeneity  is identical  between  
the two acquisitions,  as is common  for reversed-gradient  methods.  For 
each scanning  session an additional  B 0 ﬁeld map was also obtained  for 
validation.  See Table 1 for details of the scanning  parameters.  
Both GE and SE variants  of the overeasy  acquisition  were tested, each 
with similar EPI readouts  and slice bandwidths.  The spin-echo  EPI may 
be advantageous  over gradient-echo  EPI at 7T because  of the potential  
for through-slice  dephasing  in the gradient-echo,  which could cause sig- 
nal loss exactly in those regions  that suﬀer the most from distortion.  
Each EPI scan consisted  of 5 repetitions  (for noise averaging)  and the 
two slice-encoding  polarity  scans were acquired  consecutively.  Both the 
SE and GE EPI data were acquired  near-axially  (see above) at 1.5 mm 
in-plane  resolution  and a slice thickness  of 1 mm using TBW = 2.6. To 
demonstrate  the eﬀect of slice bandwidth  on the slice distortion,  we ac- 
quired multiple  runs with RF pulse durations  D = 6, 8 and 10 ms (which 
corresponds  to BW = 433, 325 and 260 Hz, respectively),  and for a sub- 
set of four subjects  the GE data with TBW = 5.2 and 7.2 and D = 10 ms 
(BW = 520 and 720 Hz, respectively).  
(Recall that the distortion  in the slice-encoding  direction  in units of 
“slice-thicknesses  ”is characterized  by the slice-encoding  bandwidth  BW 
(e.g., if the slice-select  RF pulse bandwidth  is 260 Hz, and there is a 
local B 0 ﬁeld inhomogeneity  corresponding  to an oﬀset of 520 Hz, the 
resulting  slice displacement  or distortion  will be two slice-thicknesses,  
equivalent  to twice the thickness  of the slice); however,  the distortion  
in the slice-encoding  direction  in units of millimeters  is characterized  by 
the slice-select  gradient  amplitude  G z (see appendix  of Polimeni  et al., 
2018 ).) 
To test whether  the overeasy  method  could be used to simultane-  
ously estimate  slice-encoding  distortion  and phase-encoding  distortion,  
for a subset of 5 subjects  we also acquired  SE EPI data where we al- 
ternated  both the slice-select  gradient  polarity  and the phase-encoding

Fig. 1. ( A ) Explanation  of slice-encoding  distortion  due to local B 0 ﬁeld oﬀsets and the reverse-gradient  method applied to the slice-select  direction.  The slice-select  
gradient  establishes  a mapping  between  frequency  and position  along the slice-select  direction  (here, the z direction).  A given slice location  is excited by an RF pulse 
at the corresponding  frequency.  In the absence of local B 0 ﬁeld oﬀsets, either a positive z gradient  ( + G z ) or a negative  z gradient  ( − G z ) can be applied,  and the 
desired slice location  can be excited with an RF pulse using the appropriate  center frequency,  + 𝜔 RF or − 𝜔 RF , respectively.  In the presence  of local B 0 ﬁeld oﬀsets, the 
location  of the excited slice will be shifted, and the direction  of the shift will depend on the polarity of the slice-selective  gradient.  In this case, the direction  of the 
shift will depend on whether  the + G z gradient  or the − G z gradient  is used, and the magnitude  of the shift will depend on the local B 0 ﬁeld oﬀset Δ𝜔 as well as the 
gradient  amplitude  and the RF pulse bandwidth.  A desired slice location  without the shift is marked with purple, while actual slice locations  with the shift occurring  
in presence  of + G z and − G z are marked with green and red, respectively.  ( B ) Example  of distortion-induced  displacement  (z-shift) of the voxels in the slice-encoding  
direction  within a single axial slice, caused by local B 0 ﬁeld oﬀsets, for images acquired  with two opposite  slice-encoding  gradient  polarities.  In this example  the 
shift is largest in the region at the front of the brain (near the frontal sinuses),  and manifests  as a positive z-shift when using the + G z gradient  and a negative  z-shift 
when using the − G z gradient.  
gradient  polarity.  These data were acquired  with 2 mm in-plane  resolu- 
tion and 1-mm slice thickness  using TBP = 2.6 and D = 10 ms, with alter- 
nating phase-encoding  directions:  anterior-to-posterior  and posterior-to-  
anterior  (four datasets  in total). 
To allow us to directly  compare  the distortion-correction  results 
across all acquired  slice-encoding  bandwidths  and between  the SE and 
GE EPI data, for each subject all datasets  acquired  with positive  slice- 
encoding  gradients  were co-registered  together  and then all datasets  
acquired  with negative  slice-encoding  gradients  were co-registered  to- 
gether using rigid (i.e., 6 degrees  of freedom)  registration  calculated  us- 
ing the FLIRT tool of the FSL software  package  ( Jenkinson  et al., 2002 ; 
Jenkinson  and Smith, 2001 ). The voxel shift deformation  ﬁelds were 
calculated  for each reversed  slice-encoding  volume  pair using the topup 
reversed-gradient  method  as implemented  in FSL ( Andersson  et al., 
2003 ; Smith et al., 2004 ) from SE and GE data separately.  While 
topup is mainly intended  for correcting  distortion  along the phase- 
encoding  direction,  it is possible  to use this software  to correct dis- 
tortion in any encoding  direction,  therefore  no modiﬁcations  to the 
software  were needed.  The topup method  jointly performs  distortion  and motion correction  of the input dataset to account  for poten- 
tial distortion-independent  shifts between  volumes  acquired  with re- 
versed slice-encoding  gradient  polarities;  this eﬀectively  provides  a co- 
registration  across positive  and negative  slice-encoding  gradient  polarity  
volume  pairs, ignoring  only potential  motion in the targeted  direction  
of distortion.  Two distortion  correction  approaches  were evaluated  and 
applied  to GE EPI data: (1) using the voxel shifts in the slice direction  
estimated  from the SE EPI overeasy  pairs, consistent  with the typical use 
case of the topup method,  and (2) using voxel shifts in the slice direction  
estimated  from the GE EPI data themselves,  to test whether  any signal 
loss present  due to through-slice  dephasing  would bias the results.  
Slice-distortion  can also be estimated  using a conventional  B 0 ﬁeld 
map, provided  that the slice-encoding  bandwidth,  slice thickness  and 
gradient  direction  are known,  and this distortion  estimate  should be 
equivalent  to that given by overeasy  . Therefore,  to validate  the overeasy  - 
based correction,  voxel shift maps based on separately  acquired  B 0 ﬁeld 
map scans resampled  to the EPI space were calculated,  then distorted  
along the EPI phase-encoding  direction  so that they more accurately  
matched  the distorted  EPI data. The resulting  voxel shift maps were

disintegration  ( Storsve  et al., 2016 ). Moreover,  resting-state  functional  
connectivity  changes  have been shown to co-occur  with cortical  thin- 
ning ( Schulz et al., 2022 ; Vieira et al., 2020 ). Although  there is evidence  
for interactions  between  brain network  connectivity  (i. e., the connec-  
tome) and cortical  morphology  in general,  investigations  of age-related  
cortical  thinning  in association  with connectome  topology  are scarce. 
Amassing  evidence  from joint MRI and clinical  investigations  demon-  
strates a strong link between  disease-related  alterations  of the cere- 
bral cortex and connectome  topology:  for example,  brain areas with 
prominent  cortical  atrophy  in primarily  neurodegenerative  forms of de- 
mentia appear to be strongly  structurally  and functionally  connected  
( Savard et al., 2022 ; Seeley et al., 2009 ). Moreover,  these conditions  
appear to preferentially  aﬀect brain areas located  at the associative-  
transmodal  regions,  highlighting  the relevance  of the functional  net- 
work hierarchy  in pertaining  pathomechanisms  ( Greicius  et al., 2004 ; 
Hu et al., 2022 ). In patients  with schizophrenia,  cortical  thinning  is 
primarily  observed  in “neighborhoods  ”of functionally  and structurally  
highly interconnected  brain regions  ( Shaﬁei et al., 2020 ). Subcortical  
stroke induces  cortical  thinning  in remote,  yet connected  brain regions  
( Cheng et al., 2019 ; Mayer et al., 2020 ). Lastly, network  hubs –i.e, nodes 
featuring  high connectivity  and prominent  location  within a network  –
are preferentially  targeted  in manifold  diseases  due to their topological  
centrality  and high metabolic  demands  ( Crossley  et al., 2014 ). 
Based on this evidence,  we hypothesized  that the pattern  of age- 
related interindividual  cortical  thickness  diﬀerences  –a s a cross- 
sectional  proxy of age-related  cortical  thinning  –i s associated  with 
principal  aspects  of functional  and structural  connectome  topology.  To 
address  this hypothesis,  we assessed  if the eﬀect of age on cortical  thick- 
ness occurs (1) preferentially  in network  hubs; (2) in highly intercon-  
nected network  neighborhoods  and (3) if the age-related  pattern  of 
cortical  thickness  diﬀerences  follows  the constraints  imposed  by the 
functional  network  hierarchy  as encoded  in macroscale  functional  con- 
nectivity  gradients  ( Margulies  et al., 2016 ). For this purpose,  we con- 
textualized  the pattern  of age-related  cortical  thickness  diﬀerences  and 
connectome  measures  in a surface-based  spatial correlation  analysis  in 
MRI data from participants  of a large-scale,  single-center,  population-  
based cohort study (Hamburg  City Health Study) ( Jagodzinski  et al., 
2019 ). Supplementing  our analysis  of imaging  data, we characterized  
the association  between  age-related  cortical  thickness  diﬀerences  and 
clinical  phenotypes,  speciﬁcally  cognitive  and motor functions.  With 
this work we aimed to contribute  to the understanding  of the funda- 
mental principles  underlying  age-related  structural  brain changes  and 
their clinical  phenotypes.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Study population  - the Hamburg  city health study 
Here, we investigated  cross-sectional  clinical  and imaging  data from 
a subgroup  of the ﬁrst 10,000 participants  from the Hamburg  City 
Health Study (HCHS).  As described  previously  HCHS is an ongoing,  
single-center,  prospective  cohort study examining  randomly  selected  cit- 
izens of the city of Hamburg,  Germany,  aged 45 to 74 years at time of 
selection  ( Jagodzinski  et al., 2019 ). Participants  were enrolled  between  
2016 and 2018 and underwent  an in-depth  multi-organ  baseline  exami- 
nation with emphasis  on imaging  to identify  risk factors,  prevalence  and 
prognostic  factors for major chronic  diseases.  All baseline  evaluations  
included  standardized  neuropsychological  examinations  by speciﬁcally  
trained  medical  professionals,  while brain MRI was conducted  in a sub- 
group of 2,657 participants.  Hence, we analyzed  data of those 2,657 
participants.  
2.2. Ethics approval  
The local ethics committee  of the Landesärztekammer  Hamburg  
(State of Hamburg  Chamber  of Medical  Practitioners,  PV5131)  approved  the study and written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all partic- 
ipants. Good Clinical  Practice  (GCP), Good Epidemiological  Practice  
(GEP) and the Declaration  of Helsinki  were the ethical guidelines  that 
governed  the conduct  of the study ( Petersen  et al., 2020 ).

nor an intra-class  correlation  coeﬃcient  (ICC) based on test-retest  er- 
ror; and we did not mean to imply that the observed  residual  error in 
our summaries  is equivalent  to that value. Secondly,  they argue that 
our assumption  of constant  variation  in QSM across regions  may bias 
the variance  estimates  for selected  regions;  our Figure 1 does indeed 
suggest  that residual  variation  diﬀers across the deep and inferior  gray 
regions.  Table 1 shows improved  estimates  of variance  in which a sep- 
arate model was ﬁt for each region with participant  as a random  eﬀect 
and with measurements  from the right and left hemispheres  considered  
as separate  measurements  or “pseudo-replicates  ”. In the deep and in- 
ferior gray regions,  the QSM measurements  now show more between-  
participant  variation  compared  to within-participant  variation  and are 
more similar to those reported  for amyloid  and tau PET. There remains  
little between-participant  variation  for QSM in the cortical  regions  rela- 
tive to within-participant  variation,  and therefore,  these results are not 
shown. While these results do not give test-retest  reliability,  they do 
inform measurement  error and support  Risk and Qiu’s argument  that 
there are important  diﬀerences  in susceptibility  levels across some re- 
gions within a person that should not be ignored.  
Although  we agree with the above points of Risk and Qiu, there 
are additional  considerations  for choosing  the proper variant of an ICC 
( Koo and Li, 2016 ). The proper error term to use when considering  the 
potential  utility of QSM depends  on the study design. For an analysis  
based on the summary  value from a meta region, as has been common  
for amyloid  or tau PET, a value that includes  regional  variation  will be 
appropriate,  i.e., as found in Table 2 of Cogswell  et al. If an analysis  is 
focused  on a particular  region, averaged  over hemispheres  but without  repeated  measures  on each participant,  then the values of Table 1 are 
relevant.  The test-retest  error emphasized  in Risk and Qiu applies only 
to a subset of studies,  e.g., those with multiple  measurements  per 
subject.  
Finally,  the primary  goal of our manuscript  was to assess the re- 
lationship  between  susceptibility  in deep and inferior  gray and corti- 
cal regions  with clinical  and imaging  biomarkers.  The last sentence  of 
Cogswell  et al. still provides  a useful and succinct  summary  which is 
unchanged  regardless  of the variance  analysis:  “Overall,  our ﬁndings  
suggest  that QSM may be an informative  marker  in the deep and infe- 
rior gray nuclei but in the current  implementation  has a limited role 
in the cortex for clinical  evaluation  along the aging to dementia  spec- 
trum. ” Challenges  in using QSM in its current  implementation  remain 
due to the limited associations  seen with clinical  and imaging  markers  
and diﬀerences  in associations  seen across regions.

mance.  This encoding  strategy  is known as “chunking  ”( Ericsson  et al., 
1980 ; Shiﬀrin  & Nosofsky,  1994 ), a strategy  where distinct  items are 
‘grouped’  to artiﬁcially  reduce the number  of items in a list in order to 
retain more of them. Chunking  may be a common  approach  for encod- 
ing episodic  information,  and it is an eﬀective  way to reduce the buildup  
of error inherent  in long sequences  by reducing  the amount  of informa-  
tion to be recalled  ( Buzsáki  & Moser, 2013 ; Cowan,  2001 , 2005 , 2010 ; 
Wickelgren,  1999 ). 
Despite  well-established  behavioral  demonstrations  of such mem- 
ory eﬀects and encoding  strategies  from a research  tradition  that be- 
gan more than a century  ago (i.e., Ebbinghaus,  1885 ; Jevons,  1871 ), 
their underlying  neural mechanisms  remain less fully understood.  There 
are a limited number  of event-related  electroencephalography  (EEG) 
studies focusing  on the above-mentioned  encoding  processes.  In EEG 
literature,  several studies studied  “chunking""  in the scope of language  
processing  ( Bonhage  et al., 2017 ; Gilbert et al., 2014 , 2015 ). Accord-  
ing to these studies,  delta-theta  oscillatory  responses  ( Bonhage  et al., 
2017 ), as well as N400 and P300 components  ( Gilbert et al., 2014 ), 
may reﬂect chunking-related  encoding  during language  processing.  Ad- 
ditionally,  Nogueira  et al (2015) showed  increased  late positive  slow 
waves during the encoding  of the words when the items were chunked  
( Nogueira  et al., 2015 ) compared  to a control condition.  On the other 
hand, the serial position  eﬀect was reﬂected  mostly by the late posi- 
tive event-related  potentials  (ERP), with the eﬀect depending  on stim- 
ulus modality  ( Azizian  & Polich, 2007 ; Patterson  et al., 1991 ). To our 
knowledge,  there are only a few studies investigating  neural oscillations  
underlying  the SPE directly  ( Jensen & Lisman,  1998 ; Sederberg  et al., 
2006 ). While Jensen & Lisman  (1998) focused  on the role of theta oscil- 
lations in the serial position  eﬀect, Sederberg  et al. (2006) showed  that 
the posterior  gamma  (at early serial positions)  and widespread  slow os- 
cillatory  responses  (for later serial positions)  may reﬂect the serial po- 
sition eﬀect. These relatively  few event-related  EEG studies nonetheless  
clearly demonstrate  that the EEG is a tool and method  that has been 
used successfully  before to investigate  the processes  of chunking  and 
SPE in memory  research.  
Although  these limited numbers  of pioneering  studies in which the 
eﬀect of item position  and item number  on encoding  processes  were 
studied  with the event-related  EEG method,  results were not consistent,  
and we found little recent work explicitly  addressing  these mechanisms.  
Given the relevance  of serial encoding  for our everyday  cognition  (re- 
membering  a shopping  list), this seems surprising.  Intriguingly,  noninva-  
sive neuromodulation  techniques  have recently  been used successfully  
to speciﬁcally  target cognitively  relevant  brain oscillations  to enhance  
memory  performance  ( Grover et al., 2022 ; Aktürk et al., 2022 ). There- 
fore, an in-depth  understanding  of brain oscillations  underlying  encod- 
ing processes  related to serial position  eﬀect and chunking  might di- 
rectly inform such developments  towards  cognitive  neuroenhancement  
in healthy  populations  as well as beneﬁt intervention  in pathologies  in 
which encoding  is disrupted.  
To this end, we here decided  to focus on slow oscillatory  EEG re- 
sponses  (i.e., delta and theta), since they are widely associated  with 
cognitive  processes  such as attention  and memory.  Delta responses  have 
mostly been associated  with immediate  memory  mechanisms,  decision-  
making,  and attention  allocation  processes  ( Ba ş ar-Eroglu  et al., 1992 ; 
Ergen et al., 2008 ; Harper et al., 2017 ; Polich & Kok, 1995 ; Sutton et al., 
1965 ). For example,  studies using the oddball  paradigm  report an ampli- 
tude increase  at delta frequency  when the participants  perceive  a target 
stimulus,  necessitating  the perception  and attention  processes  ( Ba ş ar- 
Eroglu et al., 1992 ; Demiralp  et al., 1999 ; Ergen et al., 2008 ). Consider-  
ing this link between  delta responses  and immediate  memory  and atten- 
tion mechanisms,  which are basic information-processing  mechanisms  
in working  memory,  we might expect that the delta response  will be 
aﬀected  by the serial positions  of items in a list and therefore  related to 
the serial position  eﬀect ( Feigenbaum  & Simon, 1962 ). Theta responses,  
on the other hand, are mostly associated  with working  memory  capac- 
ity and thereby  with the number  of items that should be remembered,  as also shown by research  on theta-gamma  coupling  ( Goodman  et al., 
2018 ; Herweg  et al., 2020 ; J. E. Lisman  & Jensen,  2013 ; J. Lisman  
& Idiart, 1995 ). Theta oscillations  take part in managing  successive  
inputs by holding  items within a single theta cycle ( Buzsáki,  2005 ; 
Herweg  et al., 2020 ). Therefore,  one might hypothesize  that “chunking  ”
could be reﬂected  by theta activity  rather than delta. 
Here, we analyzed  the pattern  of event-related  delta and theta power 
in the time-frequency  domain  over bilateral  fronto-central  and parieto-  
occipital  areas during the digit span backward  working  memory  task. 
In this task, digits were presented  to the participants  sequentially  in 
two diﬀerent  list lengths:  3 digit span (3-ds) and 5 digit span (5-ds), re- 
spectively.  After each set of digits, the participants  were asked to recall 
the digit sets in reverse  order. In order to disentangle  possible  encod- 
ing mechanisms  and memory  eﬀects reﬂected  by delta-theta  slow brain 
oscillations,  the encoding  phase of the task, during the item (digit) rep- 
resentation,  was analyzed.  
2. Materials  and Methods  
This study is part of a larger study investigating  EEG-informed  theta 
tACS after eﬀects. Here, we used the pre-tACS  EEG data of the partici-  
pants that were recorded  during the working  memory  task. These partic- 
ipants did not have tACS during or before they performed  this task, and 
they were not prepared  for tACS yet; therefore,  the current  EEG results 
and preparation  are indistinguishable  from an isolated  EEG experiment.  
However,  we think it is important  to mention  that prior to the digit span 
task, as a part of the larger tACS study design, a neuropsychological  bat- 
tery and visual and auditory  memory  tasks were administered  to partic- 
ipants for approximately  one hour (for details please see; Aktürk et al., 
2022 ). 
2.1. Participants  
A total of 44 (33 females)  right-handed,  educated  (mean years of ed- 
ucation  (SD): 16.3 ( ± 2.7)), healthy  young-adult  (mean age (SD): 24.4 
( ± 4.8)) subjects  were included  in the study. All participants  had normal  
or corrected-to-normal  vision and no speciﬁed  hearing  impairment.  Par- 
ticipants  with symptoms  or history of psychiatric  or neurological  disor- 
ders and psychiatric  or neurological  medication  usage were not included  
in the study. 
Participants  provided  written  informed  consent,  and there was no 
compensation  for participation  as indicated  in the written  informed  con- 
sent. The study was approved  by the Istanbul  Medipol  University  Ethics 
Committee  (No: 10840098-604.01.01-E.18575).  
2.2. Experimental  Design and Task Procedure  
The digit span backward  task was prepared  and presented  via E- 
prime software  (Psychology  Software  Tools Inc., Pittsburgh,  PA). This 
task mainly measures  the working  memory  abilities  of the subjects.  
Here, we presented  the task in the two diﬀerent  diﬃculty  levels, namely,  
the 3-digit span (3-ds) set and the 5-digit span set (5-ds) during the EEG 
recording.  These levels were always presented  in the same order (ﬁrst: 
3-digit span sets and then 5-digit span sets). A total of 30 diﬀerent  digit 
sets were presented  during the task in each diﬃculty  level. Digit sets 
were presented  in the pseudorandom  order across participants.  During 
the encoding  phase of the task, the digits appeared  on the screen sequen-  
tially for each digit span set, namely  5 digits were presented  for a 5-ds 
set and 3 digits were presented  for a 3-ds set. Stimulation  time per digit 
was 900 ms, and interstimulus  interval  was 600 ms between  the digits in 
a set. The encoding  phase was followed  by the recall phase. Before the 
task, participants  were instructed  to pay attention  to approaching  stim- 
uli (learning/encoding  phase) and recall a set of digits in reverse  order 
to log answers  via a keyboard  on the answer screen following  each digit 
set (recall phase).  The answer screen was presented  600 ms after the 
oﬀset of the last digit in the set and disappeared  after the participant

entered  and conﬁrmed  their answer by pressing  “enter ”; or the answer 
screen disappeared  after a maximum  of 7 seconds  for 3 digits set; 15 
seconds  for 5 digits set. A 1-second  black wait screen was presented  af- 
ter the answer screen. The design of the digit span backward  paradigm  
is shown in Fig. 1 . 
Each digit span set entered  correctly  to the answer screen for a pre- 
sented digit span set was considered  a “correct  answer ”. Accordingly,  
for a participant,  the total number  of correct answers  were calculated  as 
a “recall score ”for each diﬃculty  level separately.  The maximum  recall 
score achievable  is 30 as this is the amount  of sets presented  for each 
diﬃculty  level. 
To ensure that participants  understood  the tasks, right before the 
task, a short version  of the 3-digit span task was given as the trial. The 
same procedure  was applied  in the actual task with the diﬀerent  stimuli 
from the actual task in the trial. During the trials, 3 diﬀerent  3-ds sets 
were presented.  
The digits were shown on a 47.5 ×26.8 cm size monitor  with a 
refresh rate of 60 Hz that was placed 90 cm away from the participants.  
Digits were presented  in the center of the screen. The approximate  visual 
angle for the stimuli (each digit) measured  3 degrees  horizontally  and",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5706, 5709), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(10853, 10857), match=' \n3.'>"

One of the results from Bangladesh  showed  how the neural circuitries  
associated  with social attention  and recognition  memory  of faces might 
be potential  pathways  by which inﬂammation  aﬀects cognitive  devel- 
opment  ( Xie et al., 2019 in this issue) using a face-oddball  paradigm.  
Auditory  event-related  potentials  (ERP) discriminate  habituation  
and novelty  detection  in infants between  1 and 5 months  living in the 
United Kingdom  and Gambia,  West Africa ( Katus et al., 2020 ). The Gam- 
bian cohort didn’t present  the expected  change of intensity  to a novelty-  
based response.  
A South Africa team ( Wedderburn  et al., 2020 ) studied  children  2–
3 years old and found that cortical  surface area and thickness  within 
temporal  and frontal regions  were associated  with cognitive  impairment  
with respect to language  development.  
In an extremely  impoverished  urban setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh  
( Turesky  et al., 2020 ), the relationship  between  anthropometric  indica- 
tors (stunting,  underweight,  and wasting)  and brain structural  measures  
were tested for the ﬁrst time. Positive  semi-partial  correlations  were ob- 
served between  white matter volume  and height and weight measures.  
To study a cohort of 30 malnourished  children  in Colombia,  
Fishell et al. (2020) introduced,  a portable  functional  near-infrared  spec- 
troscopy  (fNIRS)  with evoked  potentials  to the “passive  word listening  
task ”replicating  previously  published  work. 
A comprehensive  longitudinal  interventional  study in Mexico  is re- 
ported by ( Harmony,  2021 ) with 445 children  with prenatal  and peri- 
natal risk of brain damage,  with more than 80% having abnormal  
MRI scans. After 8 years of follow-up  with Katona’s  neurohabilita-  
tion method,  78% of highly preterm,  76% very preterm,  and 78% late 
preterm,  respectively,  showed  typical neurodevelopment.  This work 
highlights  the need to evaluate,  at an early age, all newborns  with prena- 
tal and perinatal  risk factors for brain damage.  The paper also describes  
a neuroimaging  facility in an LMIC that has achieved  excellence  and 
linked its eﬀorts to solve health issues of the local underserved  popula-  
tion. 
Childhood  malnutrition  and the study of its impact on neurodevelop-  
ment were summarized  by Galler et al. (2021) . It highlighted  how most 
studies have relied on neuropsychological  tests, school performance,  
and mental health and behavioral  measures.  Few studies,  in contrast,  
have assessed  brain structure  and function,  and to date, these have 
mainly relied on low-cost  techniques,  including  electroencephalography  
(EEG) and the application  of evoked  potentials  (ERP). The use of more 
advanced  neuroimaging  methods,  including  magnetic  resonance  imag- 
ing (MRI) and functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy  (fNIRS),  has been 
limited by cost factors and the lack of availability  of these technologies  
in developing  countries  where malnutrition  is nearly ubiquitous.  
The critical and neglected  topic of victims  of urban violence  in Brazil 
at risk of developing  Posttraumatic  Stress Disorder  (PTSD) is addressed  
by ( Lobo et al., 2021 ). They aimed to investigate  how the severity  of 
posttraumatic  stress symptoms  (PTSS) is related to motor preparation  
against  visual threat cues. Longer ERPs latencies  and a slower reaction  
time indicate  the severity  of PTSD. 
2. Aging and dementia  
A multi-center  and multinational  study, including  Argentina,  Chile, 
Australia,  Poland,  and Colombia,  validated  a benchmark  for future as- 
sessments  of reliability  and reproducibility  in Alzheimer’s  Disease  (AD) 
using machine-learning  tools to integrate  multimodal  EEG and MRI mea- 
sures ( Bachli et al., 2020 ). Executive  functions  and brain atrophy  vol- 
ume (voxel-based  morphometry  from frontotemporal-insular  and tem- 
poroparietal  regions)  identiﬁed  the most relevant  features  in predicting  
the incidence  of AD. 
The ﬁrst direct comparison  of EEG and structural  MRI (sMRI) for the 
classiﬁcation  of AD and amnestic  MCI (aMCI) is reported  in Turkey by 
( Farina et al., 2020 ). They found that sMRI outperformed  resting-state  EEG in classifying  AD (AUCs = 1.00 vs. 0.76, respectively).  However,  
EEG and sMRI were only moderately  eﬀective  at distinguishing  aMCI 
from healthy  aging (AUCs = 0.67–0.73).  The addition  of EEG in the pre- 
diction equation  didn’t add a beneﬁt relative  to Mini-Mental  State Ex- 
amination  (MMSE)  scores alone.

Results  
Children  show limbic community  expansion  and greater integration  of 
somatomotor  and language  communities  
We ﬁrst examined  how cortical  patterns  of functional  communities  
diﬀered  in middle childhood  from patterns  previously  found in adults. 
We used a well-established  community  detection  algorithm,  applied  to 
adults in Yeo et al. (2011) , to create a group-level  developmental  parti- 
tion from vertex connectivity  proﬁles  ( Fig. 1 ). We investigated  the sta- 
bility of community  partitions  across diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  
with a resampling  approach  to determine  whether  k = 7 was a reasonable  
choice. Local minima  in instability  indicate  the number  of communities  
that can stably estimated  using the clustering  algorithm;  we observe  
a marked  increase  in instability  after 𝑘 = 7 ( Fig. 1 b). Though  our pri- 
mary goal was ease of comparison  to the adult 7-community  partition  
in Yeo et al. (2011) , our ﬁndings  of a local minimum  at k = 7, as was 
found in an adult sample ( Yeo et al., 2011 ), suggests  that 7 communi-  
ties is an appropriate  starting  point for partitioning  cortex in children.  
The resulting  child clustering  partition  with 7 communities  is shown 
in Fig. 2 b. In Fig. 2 c, we show the allocation  of cortex to communi-  
ties in the clustering  partition  and a comparison  to the adult partition.  
In the clustering  partition,  more total surface area was assigned  to the 
limbic and visual communities  than in the adult partition,  and less to 
the default and frontoparietal  communities  than in the adult partition.  
This observation  is suggestive  of a relative  expansion  of limbic and vi- 
sual territory,  and contraction  of default and frontoparietal  territory,  in 
children  relative  to adults. 
To further probe the diﬀerences  between  the contours  of children’s  
functional  communities  and those of adults, we investigated  measures  
of partition  similarity  and the speciﬁc  brain regions  that showed  dif- 
ferences  in community  assignment.  The clustering  partition  is signiﬁ- 
cantly more similar to the adult partition  than expected  by chance:  the 
normalized  mutual information  of the two partitions  is 0 . 64 ( p < 0.001, 
permutation  test), and the normalized  information  distance  ( Vinh et al., 
2010 ) is 0.36 ( p < 0.001, permutation  test). Further,  39 . 53 % of vertices  
(ignoring  the medial wall) have a diﬀerent  assignment  in the clustering  
partition  than in the adult partition.  Of these vertices,  the majority  of 
switches  were in assignment  of (i) adult default system regions  to the 
limbic community  in children  ( 29 . 63 %), and of (ii) adult somatomotor  
regions  to the ventral attention  community  in children  ( 23 . 8 %) ( Fig. 2 d). 
9 . 46 % of switches  were from the frontoparietal  to the default commu-  
nity, and 8 . 63 % were from the ventral attention  to the frontoparietal  
community.  The ventral regions  of the precentral  (primary  motor cor- 
tex) and postcentral  gyri (primary  somatosensory  cortex),  regions  that 
typically  encode the face ( Weiss et al., 2013 ), are clustered  with the ven- tral attention  community,  a fractionation  that was previously  observed  
in the 17-community  partition  in adults in Yeo et al. (2011) . 
Uncertainty  in community  assignment  is high in transmodal  regions 
When connectivity  is distributed  evenly in a similar pattern  across 
communities,  the assignment  of regions  to communities  will be uncer- 
tain, whereas  when connectivity  is clearly segregated  into diﬀerenti-  
ated patterns,  the assignment  of regions  to communities  will be cer- 
tain. Here we sought to understand  where connectivity  may not yet be 
clearly segregated  in the child brain, and we therefore  calculated  the 
certainty  in the assignment  of regions  to communities.  We employed  
the conﬁdence  measure  used in Yeo et al. (2011) to index certainty  in 
community  assignment  across vertices  (see Methods);  higher values of 
conﬁdence  are indicative  of higher certainty  in community  assignment.  
In the adult sample examined  by Yeo et al. (2011) , areas of low con- 
ﬁdence  fall primarily  along borders  between  communities,  and some- 
times indicate  where communities  could be fractionated  in a higher-  
resolution  partition  ( Fig. 2 a). Similarly,  areas of low conﬁdence  also 
fall along boundaries  between  communities  in the clustering  partition  
( Fig. 2 b), but there are additional  regions  in the clustering  partition  
that show low conﬁdence  in assignment  in the posterior  cingulate,  pre- 
cuneus,  and inferior  parietal  lobule (circled  in Fig. 3 a and 3 b). Despite  
lower conﬁdence,  the precuneus  and posterior  cingulate  area maintain  
similar community  assignment  across both the adult partition  and the 
two developmental  partitions  ( Fig. 2 b and 4 a-c), varying  only in their 
spatial extent. Similarly  to adults, areas of low conﬁdence  in children  
seem to primarily  indicate  fuzzy delineations  between  communities,  but 
it is diﬃcult  to ascertain  visually  whether  the certainty  along boundaries  
of higher-order  communities  is lower than the certainty  along bound- 
aries of primary  sensory  areas. For that, we turn to an investigation  at 
the level of functional  systems.  
We asked whether  fuzzy delineations  of boundaries  are distributed  
broadly  across association  cortex in both childhood  and adulthood,  or 
whether  children  show areas of undiﬀerentiated  connectivity  primar-  
ily within the limbic and somatomotor  systems  that are assigned  dif- 
ferently  than in adults. We quantiﬁed  this by calculating  the median  
conﬁdence  within each community  in both the adult and child samples  
( Fig. 3 c,d). In the adult sample examined  in Yeo et al. (2011) , conﬁ- 
dence was highest  in vertices  assigned  to the visual and somatomotor  
systems  and slightly  lower in vertices  assigned  to higher-order  associa-  
tion systems  ( Fig. 3 c, 𝐻(6) = 21179 . 38 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ). In particular,  there 
was lowest conﬁdence  in assignment  in regions  in the frontoparietal  
(all pairwise  comparisons  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected)  and dorsal at- 
tention  systems  (all pairwise  comparisons  signiﬁcant  except ventral at- 
tention,  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected).  In our developmental  sample,  
conﬁdence  was again highest  in vertices  assigned  to the visual commu-  
nity, with signiﬁcantly  lower conﬁdence  in vertices  assigned  to other 
communities  ( Fig. 3 d, 𝐻(6) = 25933 . 24 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ). There was lowest 
conﬁdence  in assignment  in regions  assigned  to higher-order  association  
communities,  in particular,  the dorsal attention  (all pairwise  compar-  
isons 𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  default (all pairwise  comparisons  
signiﬁcant  except dorsal attention  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  and 
frontoparietal  systems  (all pairwise  comparisons  signiﬁcant,  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , 
Bonferroni  corrected).  These results are robust to using the community  
assignments  from the adult clustering  partition  instead  of the child clus- 
tering partition  (see Figure S1a, 𝐻(6) = 28310 . 69 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ), ﬁnd- 
ing again that conﬁdence  was highest  in vertices  assigned  to the vi- 
sual system,  and lowest in frontoparietal  (all pairwise  comparisons  
𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  dorsal attention  (all pairwise  compar-  
isons 𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  and default (all pairwise  compar-  
isons except ventral attention  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected).  Note that 
values of conﬁdence  in the developmental  sample are overall lower than 
those of the adult sample used in Yeo et al. (2011) , though we do not 
conduct  statistical  tests comparing  the two, as this diﬀerence  could be 
due to other discrepancies  between  the adult data and the developmen-

Fig. 1. Overview  of methods.  The adult partition  of cortical regions into 7 communities  ( Yeo et al., 2011 ) (inset) was compared  to two developmental  partitions:  one 
generated  using a data-driven  clustering  approach  and one generated  using a model-based  WSBM approach.  a. The data-driven  clustering  approach  was developed  
by Yeo et al. Yeo et al. (2011) and attempts  to cluster areas into communities  based on their patterns  of connectivity  to the rest of the brain. b. Schematic  of 
pipeline  for generating  the data-driven  clustering  partition.  Vertex-wise  surface data was extracted  and correlation  proﬁles across 1175 equally-spaced  regions of 
interest (ROIs) were calculated  for each vertex (average  correlation  proﬁles depicted).  These proﬁles were then used as input to the clustering  algorithm,  which 
attempts  to cluster vertices into 𝑘 = 7 communities.  c. We investigated  the stability  of diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ) using a resampling  approach  combined  
with the clustering  algorithm  (see Methods  ). With an increasing  number of estimated  communities,  we observe less stability,  which is expected  as the number of 
estimated  communities  enlarges  the solution  space of the clustering  problem.  Local minima indicate  the number of communities  that can be stably estimated  using 
the clustering  algorithm;  we observe a marked increase  in instability  after 𝑘 = 7 (black line). d, The generative  WSBM approach  models interactions  both within and 
between  communities,  attempting  to partition  communities  such that nodes with similar patterns  of connectivity  are grouped  together.  e. Schematic  of pipeline  for 
generating  the WSBM partition.  Due to the computational  limits of the WSBM algorithm,  we took a common  dimensionality-reduction  step, and used a 400-region  
parcellation  ( Schaefer  et al., 2018 ) to downsample  the data and extract regional  timeseries.  Correlations  between  regional  timeseries  were represented  as a network;  
here we depict the average correlation  matrix. These networks  were then used as input to the WSBM, which attempts  to group parcels into 𝑘 = 7 communities.  f. 
To investigate  the goodness-of-ﬁt  (log-likelihood)  of diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ) using the WSBM, we ﬁt the WSBM to our main dataset and evaluated  the 
goodness-of-ﬁt  in both the main (black) and replication  (purple)  datasets  (left panel). We ﬁnd a noted decrease  in goodness-of-ﬁt  in the replication  dataset around 
𝑘 = 5 − 6 , as generalizability  decreases.  We observed  that although  the choice of 𝑘 constrains  the number of communities  detected  at the subject level, the number of 
communities  detected  at the group consensus  level can vary from the 𝑘 set at the subject level; we observed  a distinct plateau in the number of communities  detected  
at the group level at 𝑘 = 7 (right panel). (For interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
tal data used here. Our results suggest  that in the child brain, connectiv-  
ity in higher-order  association  regions,  particularly  the dorsal attention,  
default,  and frontoparietal  communities,  is not yet clearly segregated.  
We wondered  whether  areas of undiﬀerentiated  connectivity  in chil- 
dren were similar or diﬀerent  to those found in adults. We began by com- 
paring the spatial distributions  of conﬁdence  in the adult and child sam- 
ples. Summing  the conﬁdence  maps, we found that areas of low conﬁ- 
dence are predominantly  in higher-order  association  cortex in both chil- 
dren and adults ( Fig. 3 e). Visual cortex and the somatomotor  strip show 
relatively  high conﬁdence  in both samples.  Examining  the diﬀerences  in 
conﬁdence  between  adult and child samples,  we found that overall,  chil- 
dren show lower conﬁdence  in community  assignment  ( Fig. 3 f). We did 
not strongly  interpret  this diﬀerence  because  it could arise from several 
distinct  diﬀerences  between  the adult data used by Yeo et al. (2011) and the child data used here. Note that visual areas show no diﬀerences  in 
conﬁdence  between  adult and child samples,  as they are relatively  high 
conﬁdence  in both adults and children.  Overall,  these results above sug- 
gest that children’s  cortical  patterns  of connectivity  may be less diﬀer- 
entiated  than those of the adult brain. 
When examining  the distribution  of certainty  across communities,  
we found that the dorsal attention  community  in particular  had some 
regions  with very low values of conﬁdence.  Investigating  these values, 
we found that these regions  were located  along the border between  the 
visual and dorsal attention  communities  (see Supplemental  Figure S2). 
Some of these areas are assigned  to the visual community  in the adult 
clustering  partition  (see negative  values in the visual community  in Sup- 
plemental  Figure S1). We observe  the assignment  of a coherent  region 
in the superior  parietal  lobule, adjacent  to the intraparietal  sulcus, to

the visual community  in the child clustering  partition.  In the adult par- 
tition, a smaller  region in this area is assigned  to the visual system.  This 
is also consistent  with the increased  surface area allocated  to the visual 
community  in the child clustering  partition,  compared  to in the adult 
partition  (see Fig. 2 c), suggesting  that these areas may be more tightly 
linked to extrastriate  cortex (area MT and anterior  MT) in childhood  
than in adulthood.  
Data ‐driven community  assignments  are highly stable across samples  
If children’s  patterns  of brain connectivity  are simply more diﬀer- 
ent from each other (i.e., higher interindividual  variability)  than adult’s 
patterns  of brain connectivity  are, then partitions  derived  from develop-  
mental data might be less stable across samples.  Therefore,  we employed  
a replication  dataset of children  from the Adolescent  Brain and Cogni- 
tive Development  (ABCD)  study to assess the reliability  and generaliz-  
ability of our ﬁndings.  Identical  preprocessing  and clustering  algorithm  
implementations  were used on the replication  dataset,  drawn from two 
ABCD sites. Community  assignments  in the replication  clustering  parti- 
tion are highly consistent  with those generated  using the original  dataset 
(see Figure S4a and S4b). A total of 94 . 99 % vertices  are assigned  to the 
same community  across both datasets,  with 94.76%  of vertices  in the 
right hemisphere  and 95.21%  of vertices  in the left hemisphere  being 
assigned  to the same community.  Normalized  mutual information  (NMI) 
of the two partitions  is 0 . 88 , and normalized  information  distance  is 0 . 12 . 
These results suggest  that the cortical  patterning  of functional  commu-  
nities in middle childhood  is stable, and reliably  shows diﬀerences  from 
adult community  organization.  Children  show less-solidiﬁed  higher ‐order community  interactions  in 
association  cortex 
Using the data-driven  approach,  we observed  that there were stable 
and reliable  patterns  of cortical  community  structure  in middle child- 
hood that diﬀer from those established  in adults. Notably,  we found con- 
siderable  reapportionment  of adult default system regions  to the limbic 
community,  as well somatomotor  regions  to the ventral attention  com- 
munity.  This raises the question  of the origins of these assignments–
is it due to changes  in connectivity  between  these speciﬁc  systems,  or 
broader  diﬀerences  in patterns  of connectivity  across all other functional  
communities?  To address  this question,  we turned to another  commu-  
nity detection  approach,  a generative  model-based  approach  called the 
weighted  stochastic  block model (WSBM),  that diﬀers from the data- 
driven approach  in several important  ways. For one, it explicitly  models 
the interactions  between  communities.  While the data-driven  approach  
models patterns  of connectivity  and attempts  to group regions  with sim- 
ilar patterns  together  into a community,  the model-based  approach  par- 
titions cortex by maximizing  the likelihood  that each ”block ”of connec-  
tions between  two communities  is internally  similar and coherent.  Addi- 
tionally,  using WSBM allows us to assess not just the reliability  of these 
cortical  patterns  of communities  across approaches,  but also employ  a 
more biologically-motivated  method  with fewer motivating  principles.  
We ﬁrst examined  whether  cortical  patterns  of communities  esti- 
mated using the model-based  approach  resemble  those found in adults 
or those found using the data-driven  approach  in children.  We used the 
WSBM to create a group-level  developmental  partition  from average  par- 
cel connectivity  patterns  ( Figure 1 ). To determine  whether  7 communi-  
ties was a reasonable  choice when using the model-based  approach,  we 
ﬁrst systematically  investigated  the goodness-of-ﬁt  of the WSBM across 
diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ). When ﬁtting the WSBM to our 
main dataset,  we observe  the goodness-of-ﬁt  steadily  increases  with in-

Furthermore,  the noise can reduce reproducibility  and reliability,  mak- 
ing the results from diﬀerent  studies less consistent  and more diﬃcult  
to compare  ( Birn et al., 2014 ). Thus, rs-fMRI  denoising,  which separates  
neuronal  signals from noise, has been considered  one of the most impor- 
tant preprocessing  steps prior to any rs-fMRI  post-analysis  and appears  
in many rs-fMRI  preprocessing  pipelines  and toolboxes  ( Behzadi  et al., 
2007; Esteban  et al., 2019; Muschelli  et al., 2014; Pruim et al., 2015; 
Song et al., 2011; Whitﬁeld-Gabrieli  and Nieto-Castanon,  2012; Yan and 
Zang, 2010 ). 
Numerous  noise removal  methods  have been proposed  to clean BOLD 
signals ( Agrawal  et al., 2020; Behzadi  et al., 2007; Kam et al., 2019; Mur- 
phy et al., 2013; Pruim et al., 2015; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ). These 
methods  can be broadly  grouped  into two categories:  “reference-based  ”
(or model-based)  and “data-driven  ” approaches  ( Agrawal  et al., 2020; 
Murphy  et al., 2013; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ). Reference-based  
approaches  utilize external  reference  signals ( 𝑒.𝑔. , electrocardiography  
(ECG), pulse oximetry,  and respiratory  belts) to estimate  physiological  
noise-related  BOLD ﬂuctuations  by concurrently  recording  cardiac,  res- 
piratory,  end-tidal  CO 2 , or blood pressure  traces, and then regress out 
the noise by implementing  various  types of ﬁlters associated  with spa- 
tial, temporal,  or spectral  characteristics  of the physiological  variance  
( Birn et al., 2008a; 2008b; Chang et al., 2009; Chang and Glover,  2009; 
Glover et al., 2000; Harvey  et al., 2008 ). These methods  require  the col- 
lection of signals external  to fMRI acquisition,  which may not always 
be available  because  of the lack of equipment  or technical  diﬃculties,  
particularly  in patient settings,  and can even induce additional  noise in 
an MR environment  ( Agrawal  et al., 2020 ). Moreover,  these methods  
only work if the noise has predeﬁned  properties  or patterns  that will 
result in accurate  noise modeling  and successful  noise removal.  Thus, 
only a few noise sources,  such as respiratory  and cardiac  signals,  can 
be accurately  modeled  based on prior knowledge  of their frequency  and 
phase information,  whereas  reference-based  approaches  may not work 
well for more diverse  and complex  noise ( Agrawal  et al., 2020; Kundu 
et al., 2017; Murphy  et al., 2013 ). 
In contrast,  data-driven  approaches  use only the rs-fMRI  data it- 
self ( Agrawal  et al., 2020; Murphy  et al., 2013; Salimi-Khorshidi  
et al., 2014 ). In conventional  data-driven  approaches,  band-pass  ﬁlter- 
ing ( Fransson,  2005; Greicius  et al., 2003 ), spatial/temporal  smooth-  
ing ( Cox, 1996; Friston et al., 2000; Lindquist  et al., 2010; Lindquist  
and Wager, 2008; Smith et al., 2004; Wink and Roerdink,  2004 ), and 
nuisance  signal regression  such as head motion parameters,  white mat- 
ter/cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF) signals,  and/or global signals ( Friston 
et al., 1996; Lemieux  et al., 2007; Power et al., 2014; Satterthwaite  
et al., 2013; Weissenbacher  et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2013 ) have been 
widely used. 
Recently,  component-based  methods  such as principal  component  
analysis  (PCA) and spatial/temporal  independent  component  analysis  
(ICA) have shed light on data-driven  rs-fMRI  denoising  ( Baxter et al., 
2019; Behzadi  et al., 2007; Glasser  et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2016; 
Muschelli  et al., 2014; Pruim et al., 2015 ). In particular,  spatial ICA, 
which decomposes  the observed  rs-fMRI  into a set of spatially  indepen-  
dent components  (ICs), each of which is composed  of a spatial map ( 𝑖.𝑒. , 
IC spatial maps) along with their associated  temporal  activities  ( 𝑖.𝑒. , IC 
time series), has been widely adopted  to separate  noise from the rs- 
fMRI data ( Baxter et al., 2019; Glasser  et al., 2013; Muschelli  et al., 
2014; Pruim et al., 2015 ). It is widely known that some ICs are re- 
lated to neural activities  (or signals),  while others resemble  noise and 
artifacts  ( McKeown  et al., 1998 ). Spatial ICA-based  rs-fMRI  denoising  
techniques  have been implemented  in several state-of-the-art  rs-fMRI  
preprocessing  pipelines,  such as the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ), developing  HCP (dHCP)  ( Baxter et al., 2019 ), and 
UK Biobank  ( Miller et al., 2016 ). In these pipelines,  spatial ICA is ap- 
plied to each rs-fMRI  data and usually  generates  more than 100 ICs to 
regress out noise-related  ICs (noise ICs) from the data for producing  
cleaned  rs-fMRI  data. However,  it is challenging  to determine  whether  
each IC is signal or noise because  there are no well-deﬁned  noise iden- tiﬁcation  criteria  ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2017 ). If manual  selection  is done by 
human experts,  adequate  knowledge  of the spatio-temporal  character-  
istics of signal/noise  in rs-fMRI  is required.  Furthermore,  this process  is 
extremely  time-consuming  and laborious  ( Bhaganagarapu  et al., 2013; 
Griﬀanti  et al., 2017 ). 
Several  machine  learning-based  methods  have been proposed  to fa- 
cilitate such a decision-making  process  ( Bhaganagarapu  et al., 2013; 
De Martino  et al., 2007; Perlbarg  et al., 2007; Pruim et al., 2015; Rum- 
mel et al., 2013; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014; Tohka et al., 2008 ) by 
automatically  identifying  noise ICs. Speciﬁcally,  the FMRIB’s  ICA-based  
X-noiseiﬁer  (FIX) ( Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), which utilizes  more 
than 180 spatio-temporal  features  and multiple  classiﬁers  based on var- 
ious machine  learning  models,  has been integrated  into a well used 
toolbox,  FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ), and has been widely adopted  
by some recent major rs-fMRI  preprocessing  pipelines  such as the HCP 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). By borrowing  various  well-deﬁned  descriptive  
metrics  in the image-computing  ﬁeld, the FIX extracts  manually  engi- 
neered spatial and temporal  features  from the IC spatial maps and the 
associated  time series, respectively,  and then independently  constructs  
multiple  (weak) classiﬁers  from which the results are combined  by en- 
semble learning  to boost accuracy  ( Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ). 
While these machine  learning-based  approaches  have outstanding  
performance  in detecting  noise ICs, several issues still need to be solved. 
First, conventional  machine  learning-based  approaches  use predeﬁned  
and manually  engineered  spatial and temporal  features  of images and 
time series, respectively.  This is based on our working  knowledge  of 
what distinguishes  signals from noise; however,  there is always a lack of 
a universal  deﬁnition  of a noise-related  source or an artifact.  Although  
some studies tried to summarize  them without  computerized  automa-  
tion ( Caballero-Gaudes  and Reynolds,  2017; Griﬀanti  et al., 2017; Mur- 
phy et al., 2013; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), their result could be 
biased and erroneous.  Moreover,  depending  on the data sets, it is pos- 
sible that unknown  noise could contribute  to rs-fMRI.  In practice,  we 
have limited knowledge  of the features  that need to be extracted.  Thus, 
multiple-classiﬁer  assembly,  which is time-consuming,  should be per- 
formed  to improve  performance.  Second,  each of the various  machine  
learning  models,  which is adopted  in the conventional  approaches  to 
extract spatial or temporal  features  of ICs, is independently  optimized  
without  any interactions  that could contribute  to another.  Thus, spatial 
and temporal  features  may not contribute  to the ﬁnal decision.  These 
approaches  could also prevent  the training  of more generalized  models 
and reduce the advantages  of data-driven  methods.  Finally,  because  ex- 
tracting  a large number  of spatial or temporal  features  from each data 
and assembling  multiple  classiﬁers  through  time-consuming  processes  
are necessary,  conventional  machine  learning-based  methods  usually  re- 
quire long periods  of both training  and testing phases.  For example,  FIX 
performs  spatial clustering  to extract the sizes of activation  and deac- 
tivation  clusters  and their spatial distributions,  which is a very slow 
process.  
To solve these issues, in our recent work ( Kam et al., 2019 ), we pro- 
posed an end-to-end  noise detection  framework  based on deep learning  
to automatically  classify  signal and noise ICs from the results of spatial 
ICA in a data-driven  manner.  Speciﬁcally,  we utilized  vanilla convolu-  
tional neural network  (CNN) models to identify  noise ICs and demon-  
strated the eﬀectiveness  of the proposed  method  with a heterogeneous  
cohort of neonate  and infant rs-fMRI  dataset ( Howell  et al., 2019 ) that 
is very diﬀerent  from the commonly  used adult rs-fMRI  datasets,  which 
made it very challenging.  Due to its ability to automatically  learn deeply 
embedded  discriminative  features  to produce  the ﬁnal output,  CNN has 
the advantage  of learning  high-level  contextual  information  from both 
local and global scales with a non-linear  relationship  ( Aloysius  and 
Geetha,  2017 ). Inspired  by the advantages  of CNN, we sought to use 
CNNs to extract informative  spatial and temporal  features  from the IC 
spatial maps and the associated  time series, respectively,  to detect noise 
ICs from the remaining  ICs derived  from the results of spatial ICA for 
rs-fMRI  denoising.  
2  K.-S. Heo, D.-H. Shin, S.-C. Hung et al. NeuroImage  254 (2022) 119127 
In contrast  to the preliminary  work, in this study, we further ex- 
plore more complex  and advanced  CNN models to determine  if the pro- 
posed framework  would be useful not only on neonate  and infant rs- 
fMRI datasets  but also on adult rs-fMRI  datasets  from diﬀerent  studies,  
such as the HCP ( Smith et al., 2013 ) and Whitehall  II (WHII) imag- 
ing studies ( Filippini  et al., 2014 ), by enhancing  the generalizability  of 
the models.  Speciﬁcally,  we constructed  advanced  deep attentive  CNN 
models based on both the residual  neural network  (ResNet)  architecture  
( He et al., 2016 ) and attention  mechanisms  ( Woo et al., 2018 ), which 
can help train a deeper CNN to focus on crucial information  to eﬃciently  
extract and reﬁne high-level  embedded  spatial and temporal  features  
of ICs. Moreover,  we built an additional  procedure  to generate  visual 
explanations  of the decisions  of the proposed  CNN models based on a 
class-discriminative  localization  method  ( Selvaraju  et al., 2017 ), which 
allows us to conceptualize  and understand  how the proposed  CNN mod- 
els classify  the signal and noise ICs. 
The proposed  method  has the following  advantages:  1) Deep atten- 
tive spatial and temporal  features  can be learned  by considering  the 
subtle but complex  changes  in each IC in a data-driven  manner.  It 
can lead to remarkable  performance  on various  rs-fMRI  datasets  even 
from very heterogeneous  cohorts  or are acquired  during diﬀerent  rest- 
ing states. Moreover,  the deep attentive  spatio-temporal  features,  which 
are learned  simultaneously  and comprehensively  in the proposed  uni- 
ﬁed framework,  can supplement  one another  to make the ﬁnal decision.  
2) It can easily and quickly  extract features  from unseen data during 
the testing phase because  it only requires  a few matrix multiplications  
between  the trained  kernels  and input data and applies simple activa- 
tion functions.  3) It can be easily adopted  in the existing  pipelines  for 
fMRI preprocessing  of various  datasets  because  it does not depend  on the 
procedures  of the pipelines  and does not require  any prior knowledge  
about speciﬁc  types of noise that could vary in diﬀerent  datasets.  Thus, 
it provides  a convenient  and straightforward  tool for more accurate  and 
faster noise detection  processes  for rs-fMRI  denoising.  4) The proposed  
method  can provide  human experts  with a visual explanation  diﬀeren-  
tiating between  signal and noise ICs, allowing  them to make conﬁdent  
decisions.  
In terms of fast and accurate  detection  of ICs, we demonstrate  the 
eﬀectiveness  of the proposed  method  with diﬀerent  rs-fMRI  datasets  
from various  rs-fMRI  studies,  𝑖.𝑒. , the Baby Connectome  Project (BCP), 
HCP, and WHII studies.  Note that rs-fMRI  denoising  of the BCP dataset 
is more necessary  and challenging  because  the data quality is not as 
good as that of adults, and the noise of infants rs-fMRI  data could be 
diﬀerent  from that of adults due to physiological  diﬀerences,  such as 
the variations  in respiratory  or cardiac  rates of infants,  children,  and 
adults ( Fleming  et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2010 ). Notably,  the proposed  
method  also showed  outstanding  performance  on traditional  adult rs- 
fMRI datasets  from the HCP and WHII studies.  
2. Materials  and preprocessing  
2.1. BCP Dataset 
We selected  high-resolution  infant rs-fMRI  data (number  of sub- 
jects = 32, number  of scans = 93, number  of volumes  = 421, age = 379 
± 186 days) acquired  using 3T Siemens  Prisma MRI scanners  with 
both high temporal  and spatial resolutions  (TR = 0 . 8 𝑠 , spatial resolu- 
tion = 2 ×2 ×2 𝑚𝑚 ) from the BCP ( Howell  et al., 2019 ). The parents  of all 
participants  provided  permission  and informed  consent  prior to partici-  
pation, and all procedures  were approved  by the University  of North Car- 
olina at Chapel Hill and the University  of Minnesota  Institutional  Review  
Boards (IRB). We performed  head motion and geometric  distortion  cor- 
rection,  functional-anatomical  image alignment,  and one-time  resam- 
pling ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) of rs-fMRI  data using FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ). Considering  that aggressive  deformation  could cause signal dis- 
tortions,  these processes  were completed  in a native space to better ac- 
commodate  the much smaller  brain sizes of the infants at diﬀerent  ages compared  to those of adults. It also avoided  the diﬃculty  of smoothing  
kernel selection,  reduced  the partial volume  eﬀect, and made surface 
analysis  easier. We extracted  150 IC spatial maps and IC time series 
pairs from each sample of infant rs-fMRI  data (a total of 3,305 signal 
ICs and 10,645 noise ICs) using FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ). 
To achieve  an unbiased  manual  labeling  with a high inter-rater  
agreement  as ground  truth, we ﬁrst trained  eight human experts  with 
ﬁve samples  (scans) of rs-fMRI  data (a total of 750 ICs), and then cal- 
culated  the inter-rater  agreement  among each pair of raters using the 
other 20 samples  (scans) of rs-fMRI  data. We excluded  three raters 
who showed  low agreement  ( < 90%) with others, and the rest labeled  
all the rs-fMRI  data. Notably,  the inter-rater  agreement  was 92%–98%  
( Kam et al., 2019 ). 
2.2. HCP, WHII-MB6,  and WHII-STD  datasets  
We used three diﬀerent  datasets  consisting  of IC spatial maps and IC 
time series pairs extracted  from samples  of rs-fMRI  data from the Human  
Connectome  Project (HCP dataset)  ( Smith et al., 2013 ) and Whitehall  
II imaging  study (WHII-MB6  and WHII-STD  datasets)  ( Filippini  et al., 
2014 ), respectively,  as well as their labels, available  in FIX 1 ( Salimi- 
Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ). The HCP dataset consists  of a total of 22,877 
IC pairs (2,326 signal ICs and 20,551 noise ICs) extracted  from 100 
samples  (scans) derived  from the HCP using multi-band  ×8 EPI acceler-  
ation (TR = 0 . 7 𝑠 , spatial resolution  = 2 ×2 ×2 𝑚𝑚 , no spatial smoothing,  
and 2000 𝑠 FWHM highpass  temporal  ﬁltering)  2 . The WHII-MB6  dataset 
consists  of a total of 5,143 IC pairs (795 signal ICs and 4,348 noise ICs) 
from 39 samples  (scans) derived  from the WHII study ( Filippini  et al., 
2014 ), using the multi-band  ×6 EPI acceleration  (TR = 1.3 𝑠 , spatial res- 
olution  = 2 ×2 ×2 𝑚𝑚 , no spatial smoothing,  and 100 𝑠 FWHM highpass  
temporal  ﬁltering),  whereas  the WHII-STD  dataset consists  of a total of 
3,205 IC pairs from 45 samples  (scans) derived  from the more tradi- 
tional early parallel  scanning  in the WHII study ( Filippini  et al., 2014 ), 
using no EPI acceleration  (TR = 3 𝑠 , spatial resolution  = 3 ×3 ×3 𝑚𝑚 , no 
spatial smoothing,  and 100 𝑠 FWHM highpass  temporal  ﬁltering).",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5494, 5497), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(16814, 16819), match='  \n3.'>"

system,  in turn, describes  how the state of a model brain, endowed  with 
realistic  anatomy,  would evolve over time. The time series generated  
by the model brain and the derived  functional  connectivity  patterns  can 
then be ﬁtted to that of the real brain. Thus, a dynamical  system natu- 
rally bridges  between  the unchanging  structure  and the ever-changing  
dynamics.  
One popular  dynamical  systems  modeling  approach  is to simulate  
the noise-driven  dynamics  near a chosen attractor,  such as the low ac- 
tivity ground  state, and compare  it to the human resting brain dynamics  
(see Cabral et al. (2017) for a summary  of diﬀerent  approaches).  Such 
noise-driven  exploration  of a single attractor  has been shown to exhibit 
key features  of human resting brain dynamics,  especially  near criticality  
(e.g. Deco et al. (2013b)  ; Demirta  et al. (2019) ; Ghosh et al. (2008) ). 
On the other hand, noise-driven  exploration  beyond  a single attrac- 
tor —across  multiple  attractors  or “ghost ” attractors  —has been shown 
to capture  non-stationary  resting brain dynamics  and the switching  be- 
tween diﬀerent  dynamic  functional  connectivity  patterns  ( Deco et al., 
2009 ; Deco and Jirsa, 2012 ; Golos et al., 2015 ; Hansen  et al., 2015 ). 
The best ﬁt to empirical  data is often found near the onset of multi- 
stability  ( Deco and Jirsa, 2012 ; Golos et al., 2015 ). These observations  
suggest  that examining  the layout of the attractor  repertoire  over the 
entire multistable  landscape  could be crucial for understanding  the or- 
ganization  of resting brain dynamics  (c.f. Golos et al. (2015) ). 
Complementing  existing  single-attractor  approaches,  the present  
work focuses  on the deterministic  features  of the multistable  landscape  
and examines  their empirical  relevance.  Speciﬁcally,  we systematically  
study the organization  of the attractor  repertoire  as a window  into the 
overall shape of the dynamic  landscape.  We focus on two complemen-  
tary features  of the attractor  repertoire:  (1) to what extent the states of 
any two brain regions  are correlated  across all attractors,  which we re- 
fer to as cross-attractor  coordination,  and (2) the distribution  of energy 
gaps between  the attractors,  which indicates  how diﬃcult  it is to move 
across attractors.  Mathematically,  the former describes  in which direc- 
tions the attractors  fall in line with each other in the state space, and 
the latter describes  the spacing  between  attractors  in a predeﬁned  direc- 
tion (such a direction  can represent  the whole brain or a speciﬁc  subnet-  
work). Empirically,  we examine  how cross-attractor  coordination  relates 
to empirically  observed  functional  connectivity  between  brain regions,  
and how energy gaps impose a cost on the realization  of speciﬁc  func- 
tional connectivity  patterns.  For constructing  the landscape,  we use a 
Wilson-Cowan  type biophysical  network  model that formally  combines  
the reduced  Wong-Wang  model ( Deco et al., 2014, 2013b ; Wong and 
Wang, 2006 ) and the Wilson-Cowan  model ( Wilson and Cowan,  1972, 
1973 ). We ﬁrst showed  that the model exhibits  extensive  multistability,  
i.e. a large repertoire  of attractors  to serve as landmarks  of the land- 
scape. Further,  the model also allows us to examine,  computationally  
and analytically,  how structural  features  across scales shape this reper- 
toire. It is important  to note that here we used a broader  deﬁnition  
of structural  features  and not only include  large-scale  structural  con- 
nectivity  between  brain regions,  but also local recurrent  connectivity  
within regions,  and biophysical  constraints  at the cellular  level. Using 
this modeling  framework  and a small dataset from the Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP; n = 100; Van Essen et al, 2013 ), we provide  evidence  
with regards  to how the cross-attractor  relations  in the repertoire  could 
better capture  key features  of human resting functional  connectivity  and 
how such features  are shaped by structural  features  across scales. Fi- 
nally, we provide  a novel framework  to analyze  the energy constraints  
for such cross-attractor  coordination  across diﬀerent  local and global 
structures.  
2. Results  
2.1. The model 
Whole-brain  dynamics  are modeled  as the mean-ﬁeld  activity  of 
neuronal  populations  in each brain region. We use a Wilson-Cowan  type model ( Wilson and Cowan,  1972, 1973 ), which is also an adapted  
version  of the Wong-Wang  model ( Deco et al., 2014 ; Wong and 
Wang, 2006 ) with a sigmoidal  transfer  function  (equation  S11). The 
adaptation  improves  the biological  plausibility  and multistability  upon 
the reduced  Wong-Wang  model. Here, we brieﬂy introduce  the model; 
an extensive  analysis  of the numeric  and mathematical  properties  of the 
model is provided  in the Supplementary  Materials  (Section  S4 for nu- 
meric results,  Section  S8-S9 - for analytical  results).  Each model region 
contains  a pair of excitatory  (E) and inhibitory  (I) populations,  whose 
activity  is described  by the local model Fig. 1 a, left box; equation  1 - (3) in 
terms of the state variables  𝑆 𝐸 and 𝑆 𝐼 . Physically,  𝑆 𝐸 and 𝑆 𝐼 are inter- 
preted as the fraction  of open synaptic  channels  in their respective  pop- 
ulations,  i.e. the gating variables.  Through  local connections  ( 𝑤 ’s), the 
excitatory  population  excites itself with strength  𝑤 𝐸𝐸 and the inhibitory  
population  with strength  𝑤 𝐸𝐼 , while the inhibitory  population  inhibits  
itself with strength  𝑤 𝐼𝐼 and the excitatory  population  with strength  𝑤 𝐼𝐸 . 
Local models further connect  to each other through  a global network  
Fig. 1 a, dashed lines), giving rise to the global model (right; equation  4 - 
(6) . For the global model, nodes of the large-scale  network  correspond  
to anatomical  regions  in the human brain based on a 66-region  parcel- 
lation used in Deco et al. (2013b)  and Hagmann  et al. (2008) ( Fig. 1 b). 
Edge weights  of the network  reﬂect the strength  of long-range  struc- 
tural connectivity  between  the brain regions  ( 𝐶 𝑖𝑗 in equation  6 ), either 
estimated  using structural  data from the Human  Connectome  Project 
( Civier et al., 2019 ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ) ( Section  4.5.1 ) or artiﬁ- 
cially constructed  for comparison.  The overall strength  of long-range  
connections  in the model brain is scaled by a global coupling  param- 
eter 𝐺( equation  6 ), which denotes  the overall level of inter-regional  
interaction  across the whole-brain.  In similar modeling  approaches,  𝐺
is typically  treated as a free parameter  to be ﬁtted to the empirical  
fMRI data (e.g., Deco and Jirsa (2012) ; Deco et al. (2014, 2013b)  ; 
Demirta  et al. (2019) ). It was thought  to be an indicator  of the level of 
arousal  or wakefulness  ( Jobst et al., 2017 ). In the present  work, we ﬁrst 
examine  theoretically  how parameter  𝐺inﬂuences  the dynamic  land- 
scape of the model ( Fig. 4 ) and then ﬁt it to individual  subjects’  fMRI 
data. 
In the present  work, the local and global models are used in two 
ways: (1) to compute  the repertoire  of attractors  using zero-ﬁnding  algo- 
rithms (see Section  4.2 for details)  and (2) to be numerically  integrated  
to generate  simulated  brain dynamics.  The former is used to character-  
ize the overall organization  of the model dynamic  landscape.  The latter 
is used to characterize  local explorations  of the dynamic  landscape.  Both 
aspects  are compared  to the human data to demonstrate  the empirically  
relevant  features.  Below, we ﬁrst illustrate  the concept  of a dynamic  
landscape  and cross-attractor  coordination  using a toy example,  which 
is followed  by more realistic  models to examine  how structural  proper-  
ties across scales aﬀect the dynamic  landscape.  
2.2. Multistable  landscape  of the brain shaped by structural  properties  
across scales 
We begin this subsection  with a brief introduction  to basic dynamical  
systems  concepts  necessary  for understanding  the results.  Readers  who 
are highly familiar  with dynamical  systems  concepts  such as attractors,  
phase transitions,  and bifurcations  should feel free to skip the following  
paragraph  together  with Figs. 2 and 3 . 
We ﬁrst introduce  basic dynamical  systems  concepts  using a toy 
model of a single brain region ( Fig. 2 ), and then show how inter-regional  
synchronization  arises within this conceptual  framework  using a toy 
model of two-region  coordination  ( Fig. 3 ). The dynamics  of a single 
brain region is here governed  by a potential  landscape  (black curves in 
Fig. 2 a-c for three diﬀerent  landscapes).  When the brain state is in the 
bottom  of a valley (red balls), it is stable and referred  to as an attrac- 
tor. When the brain state is on a peak, it is unstable  and referred  to 
as an repeller  (black ball). These landscapes  can continuously  deform  
into one another  under the variation  of a control parameter  ( Fig. 2 d),

Fig. 1. A dynamic  mean-ﬁeld  model of the human brain. (a) The model brain (global model) consists of a network  of brain regions (local model). The local model 
(black box) describes  the interaction  between  two local neural populations  —one excitatory  ( 𝐸) and one inhibitory  ( 𝐼). The two populations  are coupled via two 
excitatory  connections  (red; 𝑤 𝐸𝐸 and 𝑤 𝐸𝐼 ) and two inhibitory  connections  (blue; 𝑤 𝐼𝐼 and 𝑤 𝐼𝐸 ). The excitatory  population  of each brain region can further receive 
input (gray arrow, 𝐼 𝐸 ) from other regions via long-range  structural  connections  (red dashed curves). (b) Nodes in the global model correspond  to 66 anatomical  
regions of the human brain, which can be linked together  by the human connectome  (see text). Regions are indexed from 1 to 66 (1-33 on the right hemisphere,  
34-66 on the left hemisphere  in reverse order, following  Deco et al. (2013b)  ). Speciﬁc region names are listed in Table S1. 
Fig. 2. Conceptual  illustration  of single-region  
dynamic  landscapes  and a bifurcation  diagram.  
(a-c) Dynamics  of a single brain region is 
here governed  by a landscape,  where the val- 
leys represent  the stable states, or attractors,  
and the peaks represent  unstable  states, or re- 
pellers. (d) The dynamic  landscape  of the re- 
gion can be deformed  or controlled  by an exter- 
nal parameter  (control  parameter)  such as the 
current input from other regions. The variation  
of the dynamic  landscape  with respect to the 
control parameter  can be studied through  the 
variation  of its attractors  and repellers,  shown 
as points projected  to the bottom plane. This 
simpliﬁed  representation,  which depicts how 
the attractors  and repellers  depend on the con- 
tinuous changes  of the control parameter,  is 
called a bifurcation  diagram  (e). In the bifurca- 
tion diagram,  each attractor  traces out a stripe 
(two red lines) under the continuous  change 
of the control parameter.  At critical values of 
the control parameter  ( ±1 ), one attractor  is an- 
nihilated  by the repeller and disappears.  This 
process is referred  to as a bifurcation.  
for example,  the total level of current  input from other brain regions.  
A bifurcation  diagram  ( Fig. 2 d bottom  plane, Fig. 2 e) keeps track of 
how the landscape  changes  with the control parameter  via the location  
of attractors  and repellers.  At certain points, an attractor  disappears  by 
merging  into a repeller,  which is called a bifurcation.  Now, let us con- 
sider a slightly  augmented  toy model that involves  two interacting  brain 
regions,  i.e., the left and right hemisphere  ( Fig. 3 ). An attractor  in this 
toy model represents  a stable pattern  of activation  over the whole brain, 
shown as boxed brains in Fig. 3 . The dynamic  landscape  determines  a 
repertoire  of attractors,  diﬀerent  combinations  of regional  states, with 
possible  paths of transitions  between  them. Fig. 3 a shows such a toy 
landscape  with four attractors  (i-iv), each with a diﬀerent  whole-brain  
activation  map. Similar  to the single-region  landscape,  the 3D landscape  
can be deformed  by changes  in a control parameter  (such as diﬀerent  
levels of inter-regional  coupling,  not shown),  which may lead to the 
creation  or destruction  of speciﬁc  attractors  through  bifurcations  (e.g., 
Fig. 3 , a to c, a to b). Such creation  and destruction  of attractors  cause a discrete  change of the attractor  repertoire,  and the set of possible  tran- 
sitions. Note that here a transition  refers to a change in state , where 
as a bifurcation  refers to a change in the attractor  repertoire  . A bifurca-  
tion can trigger a transition  if the system was in a state/attractor  that is 
destabilized  during the bifurcation;  given suﬃcient  noise, a spontaneous  
transition  can occur without  a bifurcation.  Further,  changes  in the at- 
tractor repertoire  can alter how the brain regions  coordinate  with each 
other. Two example  bifurcations  are shown in Fig. 3 b-c. In Fig. 3 b, only 
two out of four attractors  are left, such that the brain can now only tran- 
sition between  attractor  (i) and (iii), thereby  leading  both hemispheres  
to be in sync (on or oﬀ together).  This coordination  of brain regions  
(or hemispheres)  can be captured  by estimating  the cross-attractor  co- 
ordination  matrix (shown  in Fig. 3 ). Similarly,  in Fig. 3 c, three out of 
four attractors  are left after bifurcation,  leading  to more complex  co- 
ordination  between  brain regions  (or hemispheres).  Fig. 3 d-f presents  
a more complex  example,  where a ﬁner parcellation  is used and each 
brain region can now take three activation  values (instead  of just on

4. Results  
4.1. Arousal  ratings 
A mixed eﬀects model was used to analyse  the arousal  ratings,  
with ﬁxed eﬀects session (0 h, 3 h, 12 h and 1 week), cueing (cued 
and non-cued)  and emotion  (negative  and neutral),  and with the sub- 
jects as the random  eﬀect (see Fig. 2 ). There was no cueing eﬀect 
(F (0.8, 30.84) = 1.068; p = 0.293),  and no interactions:  session x cueing 
(F (2.7, 100.9) = 0.845; p = 0.461),  session x emotion  (F (3, 114) = 1.018; p = 0.388),  cueing x emotion  (F (1, 38) = 0.305; p = 0.584) and ses- 
sion x cueing x emotion  (F (3, 114) = 0.176; p = 0.913).  The results 
showed  eﬀects of session (F (3, 114) = 2.824; p = 0.042) and emotion  
(F (1, 38) = 131.6; p < 0.0001).  Post-hoc  tests revealed  a signiﬁcant  de- 
crease in arousal  across the learning  period ( t = 3.720; p FDR = 0.002;),  
i.e. from session 1 (0 h; mean = 4.889) to session 2 (3 h; mean = 4.592).  
There was a trend towards  a signiﬁcant  increase  in arousal  overnight  
(3 h; mean = 4.592; 12 h; mean = 4.710; t = 1.951; p FDR = 0.08) and 
from session 2 (3 h mean = 4.592) to session 4 (1 week; mean = 4.754; 
t = 1.894; p FDR = 0.081,).  
4.2. Functional  imaging  of the arousal rating task 
We used a repeated  measures  ANOVA  with factors cueing (cued 
and non-cued)  and emotion  (negative  and neutral)  to examine  the neu- 
roimaging  data in our ROIs (amygdala,  hippocampus,  parahippocam-  
pus, insula and OFC). This showed  a main eﬀect of emotion  in the amyg- 
dala and OFC ( Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). In the amygdala,  negative  items 
elicited  greater activation  than neutral  items, while in the OFC, the op- 
posite was true. 
We also found a cueing x emotion  interaction  in the OFC ( Table 2 
and Fig. 4 ). 
To further investigate  this interaction,  we created  a masque  using 
only the signiﬁcant  clusters  listed in Table 2 and ran a simple main 
eﬀect analysis  of cueing for the neutral  and negative  items. Signiﬁcant  
clusters  are listed in Table 3 and depicted  in Fig. 4 . 
Parameter  estimates  from the peak clusters  on each side of the OFC 
were plotted for the two valence  categories  in both the cued and non- 
cued conditions  ( Fig. 4 ). Note that responses  for negative  items were 
plotted in red-orange,  while responses  for neutral  items were plotted 
in blue-green,  and parameter  estimates  are shown on the right. Inter- 
estingly,  cueing decreased  activity  in the OFC in response  to negative  
items and increased  it in response  to neutral  items. 
Next, we investigated  whether  cueing eﬀects were modulated  by the 
duration  of SWS or REM, as shown in other studies ( Cairney  et al., 
2014 ; Tamminen  et al., 2017 ). To this end, we added the amount  of 
time spent in each sleep stage as a covariate  and re-ran the second-  
level analysis.  This revealed  a signiﬁcant  interaction  between  cueing

tations of visual stimuli ( Baldauf  and Desimone,  2014 ; Bugatus  et al., 
2017 ; Córdova  et al., 2016 ; Çukur et al., 2013 ; Peelen et al., 2009 ) or 
has examined  how attention  aﬀects the interaction  between  ongoing  
activity  in various  brain regions  ( Al-Aidroos  et al., 2012 ; Chadick  and 
Gazzaley,  2011 ; Norman-Haignere  et al., 2012 ) during an attention-  
ally demanding  task. The former research  examined  the eﬀect of at- 
tention  on bottom-up  stimulus-evoked  responses  focusing  mainly on 
high-level  visual cortex in lateral occipital-temporal  cortex (LOTC)  and 
ventral temporal  cortex (VTC) where category-selective  regions  reside 
( Kanwisher,  2010 ) and distributed  visual category  representations  are 
salient across large cortical  expanses  ( Cox and Savoy, 2003 ; Haxby et al., 
2001 ; Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008 ; Weiner  and Grill-Spector,  2013 ). These 
studies revealed  that visual attention  to items of certain categories  en- 
hances responses  in category-selective  regions  of the attended  cate- 
gory ( Kay and Yeatman,  2017 ; Moore et al., 2013 ; Wojciulik  and Kan- 
wisher,  1999 ) as well as the distributed  representations  ( Çukur et al., 
2013 ; Peelen et al., 2009 ). Nonetheless,  other studies revealed  that dis- 
tributed  responses  in LOTC and VTC represent  category  information  for 
both attended  and unattended  items ( Bracci and Op de Beeck, 2016 ; 
Bugatus  et al., 2017 ). 
Other research  examined  how attention  aﬀects the interaction  be- 
tween brain areas by measuring  the correlations  between  the residual  
activity  of pairs of brain areas after accounting  for the stimulus  driven 
component,  as the residual  ongoing  activity  is thought  to capture  more 
of the top-down  activity  that one might continuously  maintain  while 
performing  a task and is not locked to the stimulus.  This approach,  
which we refer to as “residual  correlations,  ” measures  the correlation  
between  residual  activities  across brain regions  and has been referred  
to elsewhere  as “background  connectivity  ”( Al-Aidroos  et al., 2012 ) or 
“task-residual  functional  connectivity  ”( Tran et al., 2018 ). Prior research  
has revealed  that attention  to visual items increases  the strength  of resid- 
ual correlations  between  cortical  regions  of the frontal parietal  network  
(FPN) and visual cortex ( Chadick  and Gazzaley,  2011 ; Griﬃs et al., 
2015 ) as well as between  category-selective  regions  of VTC ( Norman-  
Haignere  et al., 2012 ). 
However,  two main gaps in knowledge  remain.  First, it is unclear  
whether  selective  attention  inﬂuences  representations  of visual object 
categories  across the entire brain as most prior studies have focused  on 
a handful  of theoretically  important,  predeﬁned  cortical  regions  (but see 
Çukur et al., 2013 ). Second,  it remains  unknown  whether  neural repre- 
sentations  of attended  or ignored  information  vary with the strength  
of residual  correlations  between  cortical  areas and sensory  regions  pro- 
cessing the attended  or ignored  information.  
To address  these gaps in knowledge  we examined  the eﬀect of at- 
tention  on both visual category  representations  across the entire cortex 
and residual  correlations  between  each cortical  region in the brain and 
category-selective  regions  in VTC ( Kanwisher,  2010 ; Peelen and Down- 
ing, 2005 ), when their preferred  category  is selectively  attended  or ig- 
nored. To do so, we leveraged  a selective  attention  task we previously  
developed  ( Bugatus  et al., 2017 ) while participants  underwent  fMRI 
scanning.  In this task ( Fig 1 ), participants  were asked to view super- 
imposed  images of two categories,  attend to items of one category  and 
indicate  when items of the attended  category  were inverted.  
This experimental  paradigm  has three key advantages.  First, this 
selective  attention  task utilized  stimuli from ﬁve visual object cate- 
gories that can be readily decoded  from their distributed  responses  
across LOTC and VTC ( Bracci et al., 2017 ; Bracci and Op de 
Beeck, 2016 ; Bugatus  et al., 2017 ; Cox and Savoy, 2003 ; Grill- 
Spector  and Weiner,  2014 ; Haxby et al., 2001 ; Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008 ; 
Proklova  et al., 2016 ), suggesting  that we can use these stimuli to mea- 
sure the eﬀect of attention  on bottom-up  category  representations  for 
attended  and ignored  stimuli.  Second,  we use stimuli that are associated  
with category-selective  regions  in VTC ( Kanwisher,  2010 ), in which ac- 
tivity is critical for recognition  of these categories  ( Gaillard  et al., 2006 ; 
Jonas et al., 2014 ; Parvizi et al., 2012 ). This allowed  us to examine  the eﬀect of attention  on top-down  brain activity  by measuring  residual  
correlations  between  each brain region and category-selective  region 
when their preferred  category  was attended  or ignored.  Third, images 
of items from these attended  and ignored  object categories  were over- 
laid in a single spatial location,  and subjects  were asked to conduct  a 
perceptual  task, which allowed  us to probe the eﬀects of attending  and 
ignoring  during visual competition  without  shifting  the spatial focus of 
attention  and without  necessitating  other cognitive  processes  such as 
working  memory.  
Additionally,  we utilized  a unique analytical  approach,  combining  
two quantitative  techniques  to answer our three main questions  of in- 
terest. First, we aimed to test how selective  attention  modulates  the 
representation  of attended  vs. ignored  visual categories  by testing its 
inﬂuence  on the decodability  of visual category  information  when the 
same items are attended  or ignored.  We used a data-driven  whole-brain  
approach  to determine  where in the brain information  about attended  
and ignored  visual object categories  are decodable.  To do so, we exam- 
ined the classiﬁcation  accuracy  of category  information  in each of the 
180 brain areas of the Glasser  atlas ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ), which is the 
most recent brain parcellation  based on both functional  and structural  
metrics.  While it could be the case that information  about attended  and 
ignored  object categories  are equivalently  decodable  in all areas of cor- 
tex, or that attentional  enhancement  is present  in all areas of cortex, 
based on prior ﬁndings  summarized  above, we hypothesized  that both 
category  information  and the amount  of attentional  enhancement  would 
vary across cortical  regions.  
Second,  we aimed to test in a data-driven,  whole-brain  manner  which 
cortical  regions  have strong residual  correlations  with category-selective  
regions  of VTC when the latter regions’  preferred  categories  are either 
attended  or ignored.  Using functionally-deﬁned  category-selective  re- 
gions of VTC representing  either attended  or ignored  object categories  
provided  us with an anchor to then investigate  residual  correlations  be- 
tween these regions  and other parts of the brain. We hypothesized  that 
the strongest  residual  correlations  would be observed  between  regions  
of cortex and a particular  category-selective  region of VTC (e.g., a face- 
selective  region in the fusiform  gyrus) when participants  are cued to 
attend that region’s  preferred  category  (e.g., faces). However,  an alter- 
native hypothesis,  consistent  with literature  showing  that both attending  
and ignoring  require  top-down  cognitive  control ( Martinez-Trujillo  and 
Treue, 2004 ; Scolari et al., 2012 ), is that residual  correlations  with 
category-selective  regions  would be equally  strong regardless  of whether  
those preferred  categories  are attended  or ignored.  By utilizing  both 
actively-attended  and actively-ignored  stimuli presented  simultaneously  
in the same spatial location,  we directly  pit these competing  hypotheses  
against  one another.  
Third, importantly,  we investigated  the relationship  between  the ef- 
fects of attention  on stimulus  representations  and residual  correlations.  
That is, we sought to determine  (i) whether  there is a correlation  be- 
tween a region’s  category  representations  and its residual  correlations  
with VTC category-selective  regions,  and (ii) whether  this relationship  
is modulated  by attention.  First, we hypothesized  that if residual  corre- 
lations reﬂect the sharing  of information  about attended  visual object 
categories  between  VTC and other cortical  regions,  then it should fol- 
low that category  classiﬁcation  accuracy  would be higher in cortical  
regions  with stronger  residual  correlations  with VTC category-selective  
regions.  Second,  we hypothesized  that selective  attention  would modu- 
late this relationship,  revealing  a stronger  correlation  between  residual  
correlations  and classiﬁcation  accuracy  when images from these object 
categories  are attended  compared  to when they are ignored.  In partic- 
ular, we hypothesized  that this attentional  enhancement  of classiﬁca-  
tion accuracy  and residual  correlations  would be prominent  in regions  
of the FPN, given this network’s  established  role in goal-directed  atten- 
tion. Together  this combined  novel approach  allows us to systematically  
examine  the impact of top-down  selective  attention  on object category  
representations  and their relationship  across the brain.

2.1. Subjects  
Subjects  recruited  from Stanford  University  participated  in one of 
two studies.  The ﬁrst study included  twelve participants  (5 female,  ages 
23–44) whose data was previously  published  in ( Bugatus  et al., 2017 ). 
These participants  underwent  fMRI scanning  including  three runs of the 
Selective  Attention  task and three runs of the Oddball  task. The sec- 
ond study included  20 additional  participants  (10 female,  ages 18–37) 
from ( Keller et al., 2021 ) who participated  in one run of the Selective  
Attention  task and one run of the Oddball  task as well as other tasks 
not relevant  to this study. Because  of time constraints,  they participated  
in fewer runs of the Selective  Attention  and Oddball  tasks. Seven sub- 
jects were excluded  because  of excessive  head movement  ( > 2 voxels 
either within-scan  or between-scans)  during one or more tasks and 4 
subjects  were excluded  because  we could not localize  the majority  of 
VTC functional  ROIs of suﬃcient  size. Thus, a total sample of twenty-  
one subjects  (8 female,  ages 21–44) were included  in our analyses.  All 
subjects  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision. Ethics Statement:  
All procedures  were approved  by the Stanford  Internal  Review  Board on 
Human  Subjects  Research.  Participants  gave written  informed  consent  
before participating  in this study. 2.2. Data acquisition  and preprocessing  
Subjects  were scanned  using a General  Electric  Sigma MR750  3T 
scanner  located  in the Center for Cognitive  and Neurobiological  Imag- 
ing (CNI) at Stanford  University  using a custom-built  32-channel  head 
coil. Using an EPI sequence  with a multiplexing  (multiband)  factor of 3, 
we acquired  48 slices at 2.4 mm isotropic  resolution,  FOV = 192 mm, 
TE = 30 ms, TR = 1 s, and ﬂip angle = 62°. The slice prescription  cov- 
ered the entire brain, except for the very superior  portion  of the cortex, 
roughly  corresponding  to superior  motor and somatosensory  cortices.  
Additionally,  T1-weighted  anatomicals  of the same prescription  were 
acquired,  which were used to align the fMRI data to the whole brain 
anatomical  images.  Finally,  whole-brain  anatomical  images of each sub- 
ject’s brain were acquired  using a T1-weighted  SPGR sequence  with a 
resolution  of 1 ×1 ×1 mm, FOV = 240 mm, ﬂip angle = 12°This  volume  
anatomy  was used to create a cortical  surface reconstruction  of each sub- 
ject’s brain using FreeSurfer  6.0 ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/  ). 
Functional  data from each run was aligned  to the individual’s  own 
brain anatomy.  Motion  correction  was performed  both within and across 
functional  runs using mrVista  ( https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft  ) 
motion correction  algorithms.  Runs in which participants’  head mo- 
tion was greater than 2 voxels were discarded.  No slice-timing  correc- 
tion or global signal regression  was performed.  All data were analyzed  
within individual  participants’  native brain anatomy  space without  spa- 
tial smoothing.

In recent work we have measured  individual  diﬀerences  in the 
volume  of the ganglion  cell layer of the retina in forty-two  people 
( Chen et al., 2020 ). These measures  were adjusted  for the confounding  
eﬀect of diﬀerences  in the axial length of the eye, yielding  an estimate  
of RGC endowment  for each subject.  In these subjects  we also obtained  
structural  and diﬀusion  MRI measures.  Here we examine  how individual  
variation  in the RGCs is related to ﬁxel-based  measures  of the optic tract 
and optic radiation.  Secondarily,  we consider  how variation  in anatom-  
ical measures  along the visual pathway  are related to one another,  and 
to variation  at the front-end  of the visual system.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
42 normally  sighted  subjects  from the University  of Pennsylvania  
and surrounding  Philadelphia  community  were studied  under a pre- 
registered  project ( https://osf.io/ervrh  ). Participants  were at least 18 
years of age, had no history of ophthalmologic  disease,  and had cor- 
rected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Fourteen  of the subjects  were 
women,  and the mean age of all participants  was 28. All participants  
provided  written  consent  and the protocol  was approved  by the Univer-  
sity of Pennsylvania  Institutional  Review  Board. 
2.2. Optical coherence  tomography  (OCT) measurement  of the retinal 
ganglion  cell layer 
The retinal measurements  used here are described  fully in a prior 
publication  ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Brieﬂy,  we obtained  vertical  and hori- 
zontal images from both eyes using the Heidelberg  Spectralis  OCT (Hei- 
delberg  Engineering,  Heidelberg,  Germany;  software  version:  6.8.0.1).  
Acquisitions  were montaged  and manually  segmented.  The left and right 
eye measurements  were averaged  and the thickness  of the RGC layer 
was calculated  for each subject.  Using a model eye ( Aguirre  GK., 2019 ), 
the surface area of the imaged  region was calculated  for each subject,  
accounting  for variation  in the axial length of the eye. From this the 
volume  of ganglion  cell layer was derived,  and then corrected  for the 
confounding  eﬀect of variation  in axial length.

Fig. 1. (A) An anatomical  interpretation  of the source-separation  problem.  Electrophysiology  involves  measuring  data from electrodes  (black disks), which are 
manifest  (observable)  variables.  But electrophysiologists  are interested  in understanding  neural circuits (latent variables),  which are complex  combinations  of neurons  
and neurochemicals,  and which generate  electrical  ﬁelds that propagate  to the electrodes.  The challenge  is to leverage  the spatial correlations  across electrodes  to 
separate  activity from diﬀerent  neural sources.  The illustration  here makes it seem like the problem  is one of anatomical  assignment,  but because neural computations  
are spatially  distributed,  a single localized  dipole is not physiologically  plausible  for all high-level  sensory/cognitive/motor  phenomena.  Therefore,  the goal of source 
separation  can be treated as one of statistical  assignment.  (B) The distinction  between  univariate  (B1) and multivariate  (B2) analyses  lies in the conceptual  and 
statistical  use of the electrodes:  The univariate  approach  treats each electrode  as an independent  measurement;  the multivariate  approach  considers  that the signals 
of interest are embedded  in patterns  that span many electrodes,  and thus isolating  those signals requires  appropriately  designed  spatial ﬁlters (vectors  𝐰 and 𝐯 are 
spatial ﬁlters and 𝐗 is the channels-by-time  data matrix.

brain works. It is equally  uncontentious  to state that there is no one-to- 
one mapping  of electrode  to computational  source. The neural compu-  
tations underlying  cognition  are implemented  by complex  interactions  
across neural circuits  comprising  various  types of cells, modulations  by 
neurochemicals,  etc.; these circuit interactions  produce  electromagnetic  
ﬁelds that can be quantiﬁed  using LFP, EEG, or MEG (local ﬁeld poten- 
tial, electroencephalography,  magnetoencephalogray),  but these electri- 
cal ﬁelds propagate  to multiple  electrodes  simultaneously.  Furthermore,  
each electrode  simultaneously  measures  the electrical  ﬁelds from multi- 
ple distinct  neural circuits,  plus artifacts  from muscles  and heart beats, 
and from noise. 
Thus, the manifest  variables  (a.k.a. observable  data) that we measure  
(voltage  ﬂuctuations  in electrodes)  are indirect  and comprise  mixtures  
of the latent constructs  we seek to understand.  The mixing of sources  at 
the electrodes  motivates  multivariate  analyses  that identify  patterns  dis- 
tributed  across electrodes.  This can be contrasted  with univariate  anal- 
yses that consider  each individual  electrode  to be a separate  statistical  
unit ( Fig. 1 ). 
And yet, mass-univariate  analyses  have remained  the most common  
analysis  method  for decades.  The mass-univariate  approach  is nearly 
universally  used because  it is simple and has been successful  through-  
out the history of neuroscience,  and because  electrode  technology  and 
computational  power limited the types of analyses  that were feasible  in the past. However,  these limitations  no longer exist, and thus there is 
little justiﬁcation  for maintaining  the position  that analyses  that domi- 
nated the literature  decades  ago are prima facie optimal  today. 
Thus, the argument  here is not that mass-univariate  analyses  are 
wrong or misleading;  rather, the argument  is that progress  in neuro- 
science  will be accelerated  by shifting  to conceptualizing  and analyzing  
data with the goal of isolating  and extracting  information  that is dis- 
tributed  across a set of electrodes.  This argument  has been made several 
times before ( Buzsáki,  2010; Hebb, 1949; Makeig  et al., 2002; Uhlhaas  
et al., 2009 ), although  the increase  in simultaneously  recorded  mea- 
surements,  computational  power, and analysis  possibilities  makes mul- 
tivariate  methods  more attractive,  feasible,  and insightful  now than in 
previous  decades.  
(Although  the focus of this paper is on electrophysiology,  the pre- 
vious argument  applies to any set of brain or behavioral  manifest  vari- 
ables, including  neurons,  fMRI voxels, two-photon  imaging  pixels, reac- 
tion time, questionnaire  items, etc.) 
To be sure, there are myriad modern  data analysis  methods  that 
leverage  increased  understanding  of neurophysiology  and computa-  
tional power. Here I will focus on one family of spatial multivariate  anal- 
yses, which are used as dimension-reducing,  contrast-enhancing  spatial 
ﬁlters. A spatial ﬁlter is a set of weights,  such that the weighted  combi- 
nation of the manifest  variables  optimizes  some criteria.  That weighted  
combination  results in a reduced  number  of virtual data channels  (often 
2  M.X. Cohen NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118809 
called “components  ”) compared  to the original  dataset,  and that are de- 
signed such that each component  isolates  a pattern  in the data that may 
be mixed or have low signal-to-noise  quality in individual  electrodes.  
The purpose  of this tutorial  paper is to introduce  a family of meth- 
ods based on generalized  eigendecomposition  (GED). The GED seed can 
sprout many seemingly  diﬀerent  multivariate  applications,  which makes 
it a powerful  method  to adapt to speciﬁc  hypotheses,  research  goals, and 
dataset types. There are several other excellent  general  introductions  
to GED in the neuroscience  literature  ( de Cheveigné and  Parra, 2014; 
Haufe et al., 2014; Parra et al., 2005 ); the focus of the present  paper is 
on practical  issues that researchers  might face when implementing  GED.

and the fronto-parietal  networks  (FPN) is involved  in initiating  and 
adjusting  control ( Dosenbach  et al., 2008 ); 3) modularity  may promote  
brain adaptation  and increase  ﬂexibility  in response  to a changing  
environment  ( Sporns and Betzel, 2016 ) and prevent  catastrophic  
forgetting  ( Ellefsen  et al., 2015 ). Modules  are subnetworks  tightly 
connected  within but loosely connected  with others ( Sporns and 
Betzel, 2016 ). Therefore,  neuroscientists  often named modules  as 
networks,  e.g., visual network,  default mode network  ( Geerligs  et al., 
2015a ; Grady et al., 2016 ; Moraschi  et al., 2020 ; Power et al., 2011 ; 
Rieck et al., 2021 ; Yeo et al., 2011 ). In this article, to maintain  con- 
sistency  with previous  literature  and help readers  strictly distinguish  
the concept  of modules  and networks,  we only referred  modules  as 
networks  when a prior modular  partition  was used and the mod- 
ules were already  named as networks  in the prior. Recently,  several 
studies have been focusing  on the age-related  changes  in the brain 
functional  modular  organization  and suggested  that brain segregation  
reduces  as age increases  ( Chan et al., 2014 ; Meunier  et al., 2009a ; 
Spreng et al., 2016 ). Speciﬁcally,  lower modularity  with weaker  
intra-module  functional  connectivity  but stronger  inter-module  
functional  connectivity  was continuously  observed  across the 
lifespan  ( Chan et al., 2014 ; Geerligs  et al., 2015a ; Spreng et al., 
2016 ). The age-accompanied  functional  modular  changes  were 
mainly located  in the default mode network  (DMN),  dorsal 
attention  network  (DAN), VIS, and FPN ( Betzel et al., 2014 ; 
Cassady  et al., 2020 ; Ferreira  and Busatto,  2013 ; Grady et al., 
2016 ; Puxeddu  et al., 2020 ; Spreng et al., 2016 ). Additionally,  these 
age-related  changes  of the functional  modular  structure  were found as- 
sociated  with cognitive  control and attention  performance  ( Betzel et al., 
2014 ). 
Currently,  the module  detection  methods  used in the above age- 
related studies mainly focused  on non-overlapping  modules,  that is, 
each brain region only belongs  to a single module.  However,  neu- 
roimaging  studies have suggested  that the human brain functional  
network  is more likely to bear an overlapping  modular  organization  
( Lin et al., 2018 ; Najaﬁ et  al., 2016 ; Yeo et al., 2014 ), in which a 
brain region can participate  in more than one functional  module.  Previ- 
ous studies not only provided  rich evidence  to support  the existence  of 
overlap  among functional  modules  ( Bassett et al., 2011 ; Bullmore  and 
Sporns,  2009 ; Fries, 2005 ; Power et al., 2013 ), but also implied  that the 
concept  of overlap  may pave the way to interpret  the ﬂexible  and vari- 
able relationships  between  the human brain and cognitive  functions  in a 
more realistic  manner  ( Lin et al., 2018 ; Yeo et al., 2015 ). In particular,  it 
would be of great interest  to study how the overlapping  functional  mod- 
ular structure,  including  the overlapping  modules  and the overlapping  
nodes, change across the adult lifespan  and how such change induces  
and/or aﬀects the cognitive  functions.  However,  to date, few studies 
have examined  the changes  in overlapping  functional  modules  across 
the adult lifespan.  
To address  this issue, we employed  resting-state  functional  mag- 
netic resonance  imaging  (R-fMRI)  to explore  the overlapping  modular  
organization  of the human brain functional  network  in 570 healthy  par- 
ticipants  across the adult lifespan  (18–88 years). Firstly, the maximal-  
clique based multiobjective  evolutionary  algorithm  (MCMOEA;  
Wen et al., 2016 ; Lin et al., 2018 ) was used to identify  the overlapping  
brain functional  modular  structure  of each participant.  Secondly,  
based on the overlapping  modules  detected,  we respectively  exam- 
ined the changing  trajectories  of the overlapping  modules  and the 
overlapping  nodes during adult lifespan  by regression  models and age- 
based group comparisons.  Then, we revealed  the functional  features  
of the nodal overlapping  probability  through  functional  gra- 
dient and ﬂexibility  analyses.  Finally,  we examined  how the 
characteristics  of overlapping  modules  and nodes were related 
to ﬂuid intelligence  and the Benton face recognition  test per- 
formance,  both of which could eﬀectively  measure  individ-  
ual memory  capacity  and were already  found sensitive  to age 
( Feng et al., 2020 ; Kievit et al., 2014 ). 2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Data of 649 participants  [age range 18–88 years; mean = 59.24, 
standard  deviation  (SD) = 18.55] were obtained  from the second stage 
of the Cambridge  center for Ageing and Neuroscience  (Cam-CAN)  
( http://www.cam-can.org  , Shafto et al., 2014 ). Among  these partici-  
pants, 79 participants  were excluded  for having one of the following  
issues: missing  data (4 participants),  image artifacts  (6 participants),  
and excess head motion (69 participants,  details please see “Data ac- 
quisition  and preprocessing  ”). Thus, a ﬁnal sample of 570 participants  
(age range 18–88 years, mean = 52.88, SD = 18.44, 287 females)  was 
included  in our main analyses.  All these participants  fulﬁlled  the fol- 
lowing requests:  (1) completed  the full MRI testing session and no ab- 
normal  anatomical  structure  was observed,  (2) scored at least 25 on the 
mini mental state examination,  (3) had no contraindications  to MRI, (4) 
were native or bilingual  English  speakers,  (5) had normal  or corrected-  
to-normal  vision and hearing  and (6) no head injury or neurological  
disorders  ( Shafto et al., 2014 ). Ethical approval  was obtained  from the 
Cambridge  shire Research  Ethics Committee  and all participants  gave 
their written  informed  consent  prior to participation.  
2.2. Data acquisition  and preprocessing  
The MRI data were collected  on a 3T Siemens  TIM Trio Sys- 
tem, with a 32-channel  head coil. Resting-state  fMRI (R-fMRI)  data 
were obtained  using an echo-planar  imaging  sequence  parameters:

used? In the current  study we wanted  to determine  the neural represen-  
tation of retrieving  information  from LTM when WM capacity  is fully 
engaged.  
To explore  these questions,  in the current  study, we employed  a task 
in which participants  had to keep information  (i.e., two or four colors) 
active in WM while simultaneously  had to retrieve  information  (i.e., two 
colors) from LTM (namely,  the LTM plus WM condition).  The number  of 
colors for WM was determined  based on the classic viewpoint  that WM 
capacity  is limited to 3-4 items ( Cowan,  2001 ). Therefore,  we assumed  
that when memorizing  4 colors into WM, it is fully engaged.  The extent 
to which WM is fully engaged  is further examined  by our behavioral  and 
neural ﬁndings.  We compared  the LTM retrieval  plus WM condition  to a 
condition  in which participants  only had to keep two or four colors into 
WM (namely,  the WM condition),  and collected  behavioral  (Exp. 1 and 
2) and EEG (Exp. 3) data. 
Experiment  1 
Participants  were trained  to memorize  four diﬀerent  color arrays into 
LTM, each having two distinct  colors. After learning  these colors, par- 
ticipants  performed  another  task in which they stored two or four colors 
from new color arrays into WM only (i.e., the WM condition),  or they 
stored two or four colors into WM and simultaneously  were asked to 
retrieve  two colors from LTM (i.e., the LTM plus WM condition).  We 
reasoned  that if participants  memorized  four new colors into WM, its 
capacity  would reach its maximum  ( Cowan,  2001 ). So, if retrieving  in- 
formation  from LTM is still possible  when WM is fully engaged,  the 
overall memory  performance  in the LTM plus WM condition  would be 
better than that observed  in the WM condition.  If not, we expect that 
memory  storage  in the LTM plus WM condition  would be limited to the 
maximum  WM capacity  observed  in the WM condition.  
Method  
Participants  
Sixteen  college students  (1 man and 15 women  with a mean age of 
19.8 years old) were recruited  from Zhejiang  Normal  University  and par- 
ticipated  for monetary  compensation.  Sample  size was predetermined  
based on the main eﬀect of memory  condition  ( WM vs. LTM plus WM ) 
in the pilot study (N = 4), partial 𝜂2 = .99. With 16 subjects  and al- 
pha = .001, power for the critical eﬀect should be larger than .99. All 
participants  reported  normal  color vision, and normal  or corrected-to-  
normal  visual acuity. Written  consent  was obtained  from all of them, 
and the study was approved  by the Scientiﬁc  and Ethics Review  Com- 
mittee of the Faculty  of Behavioral  and Movement  Sciences  of the Vrije 
Universiteit  Amsterdam  (VCWE-2016-215)  and the ethical committee  of 
Zhejiang  Normal  University  (ZJNU-2020006).  
Apparatus  and stimuli 
Participants  were tested in a dimly lit laboratory  and were required  
to rest their chin on the chin rest 70 cm away from an LCD (Liquid  Crys- 
tal Display)  monitor,  1600 ×900 resolutions  with 60 Hz refresh rate, on 
which visual stimuli were presented  against  a gray (red-green-blue:  128, 
128, 128) background.  Stimulus  presentation  and response  registration  
were controlled  by scripts written  in Python.  The color squares  (sub- 
tended by 1.3°×1 . 3 °) carried diﬀerent  to-be-memorized  colors, which 
were randomly  chosen from the equal-luminance  color set (red-green-  
blue: Royal Blue [58, 105, 230], Amethyst  [134, 85, 206], Deep Cerise 
[217, 68, 135], Radical  Red [243, 66, 76], Fiery Orange  [185, 87, 34], 
Pesto [119, 107, 33], Bilbao [64, 122, 53], Dark Cyan [10, 129, 139]). 
Procedure  and design 
During LTM training,  as illustrated  in Fig. 1 A, a central white dot (il- 
lustrated  in black in the ﬁgure) with a radius of 0.2°and  six 3 ×3 grids, each subtending  4.3°×4.3°centered  6°eccentric  to the screen center, 
were presented  throughout  the trial. Seven hundred  milliseconds  after 
a trial started,  an array of two to-be-memorized  color squares  always 
appeared  at ﬁxed locations  in the two top grids for 150 ms respectively,  
followed  by an 850 ms interval.  Within each grid, the col ( Fernandes  
and Moscovitch,  2000 )or squares  could appear at any location.  At the 
end of the trial, a black square indicating  the to-be-recalled  item was 
presented  in one of previous  color squares’  locations  until the response  
was collected.  Participants  were required  to report the probe color by 
pressing  a corresponding  key on the keyboard  (from 8 potential  keys 
mapped  to the eight possible  colors).  If participants  made an error, au- 
ditory feedback  was given after the trial. The inter-trial  interval  was 
randomly  chosen from 200 –400 ms. Participants  ﬁnished  25 blocks of 
48 trials (including  16 new trials and 32 to-be-learned  trials). Note that, 
similar to Fukuda  and Woodman  (2017) , we oﬀer enough  training  to en- 
sure that information  was indeed stored in LTM, rather than presenting  
items sequentially  for a short period ( Fernandes  and Moscovitch,  2000 ). 
In the probe display,  a letter cue (A, B, C, or D for learned  arrays and N 
for new arrays) was presented  at the center of the screen so that partic- 
ipants could learn the associations  between  the letter cue and the color 
array. Each letter cue was associated  with two colors that each appeared  
at a ﬁxed location  within a unique grid at the top (e.g., red in location  
X in the top left grid and green in location  Y in the top right grid were 
associated  with one speciﬁc  letter cue). Participants  had to memorize  
both the colors and their corresponding  locations.  Importantly,  to en- 
sure the cue was informative,  each letter cue could be associated  with 
the identical  location  but with diﬀerent  colors (e.g., red in location  X in 
the top left grid for the letter cue A on one trial, and yellow in the same 
location  and the same grid for the letter cue B on another  trial). 
After LTM training,  participants  were asked to perform  a main mem- 
ory task. The procedure  for the main task was illustrated  in Fig. 1 B. In 
the WM condition,  1200 ms after the trial started,  a new color array 
consisting  of two or four color squares  appeared  in two or four grids for 
500 ms respectively  (which never appeared  in the two top grids for the 
learned  arrays from LTM training,  and the location  was randomly  cho- 
sen from four bottom  grids when the new array size was two), followed  
by a 1500 ms interval.  Then, a probe display  appeared  with a black 
square indicating  the location  of the to-be-recalled  color (belonged  to 
new color array) until the response  was collected.  
While in the LTM plus WM condition,  a learned  letter cue appeared  
350 ms before the new color array for 150 ms, instructing  participants  
to start retrieving  the corresponding  color array from LTM immediately.  
Note that, by means of EEG, Fukuda  and Woodman  (2017) showed  that 
the whole color array was retrieved  immediately  when the cue was pre- 
sented, as alpha power (i.e., an index for memory  storage)  increased  
with array size increase  around 800 ms after the cue onset. After a 1500 
ms interval,  a probe display  appeared  with a black square located  at the 
location  of the to-be-recalled  color (belonged  to either new or learned  
color array) until the response  was collected.  Within each grid, the color 
squares  could appear at any location.  Each item in diﬀerent  memory  
conditions  (WM and LTM plus WM) had equal chance to be tested. If 
participants  committed  an error, auditory  feedback  was given after the 
trial. The inter-trial  interval  was randomly  chosen from 200 –400 ms. 
Both conditions  were randomly  mixed within blocks, while diﬀerent  
set sizes of the new color array (two and four) were tested in diﬀer- 
ent blocks and the testing order was counterbalanced  between  subjects.  
Thus, a 2 (new array size: two vs. four ) ×2 (memory  condition:  WM vs. 
LTM plus WM ) within-subjects  design was adopted.  Participants  ﬁnished  
12 blocks of 60 trials (i.e., 180 trials for each new array size and each 
memory  condition).  
Analysis  
To evaluate  the overall memory  performance,  we adopted  the same 
method  as presented  in Fukuda  and Woodman  (2017) . Thus, the accu- 
racy was converted  to memory  capacity  ( K ), an estimate  of the number

Fig. 1. The experimental  procedure  in Experiment  1. A) LTM training,  in which participants  are trained to memorize  diﬀerent  arrays of two colors into LTM by 
associating  each array with a unique letter cue presented  during the probe period. B) Main task, in which participants  have to memorize  two or four colors from new 
color arrays into WM only (i.e., WM condition),  or have to memorize  two or four colors into WM and simultaneously  retrieve two colors from LTM (i.e., LTM plus 
WM condition).  The subsequent  test could be on items for either WM or LTM. 
of memorized  objects.  Eight possible  answers  could be chosen for each 
response,  participants  had a chance to correctly  guess response  with the 
probability  of 1/8. When participants  were required  to memorize  an ar- 
ray of objects (with the array size of S ), the accuracy  ( A ) could be the 
sum of K/S (for correct response  trials) and ( S-K ) /S ×1/8 (for guessing  
trials). By converting  this equation,  the memory  capacity  was calculated  
with the equation:  K = 8/7 ×S ×( A–1/8 ). In the WM condition,  the mem- 
ory capacity  of items that can be maintained  is directly  converted  from 
accuracy  with former equation.  In the LTM plus WM condition,  the cal- 
culated  memory  capacity  is the sum of the memory  capacity  for new 
arrays and the memory  capacity  for learned  arrays.

2.1. Study cohort 
Our study cohort consisted  of cognitively  unimpaired  partici-  
pants drawn from the Baltimore  Longitudinal  Study of Aging (BLSA) 
( Shock, 1985 , Ferrucci,  2008 ), and the Genetic  and Epigenetic  Signa- 
tures of Translational  Aging Laboratory  Testing  (GESTALT);  two ongo- 
ing healthy  aging cohorts  at the National  Institute  on Aging to evaluate  
multiple  biomarkers  related to aging. The inclusion  and exclusion  crite- 
ria for these two studies are virtually  identical.  Participants  underwent  
a battery  of cognitive  tests and those with cognitive  impairment  were 
excluded  ( O’Brien  et al., 2009 ). A detailed  description  of the cohort is 
presented  in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . We note that age was not signiﬁcantly  
diﬀerent  between  men and women.  Experimental  procedures  were per- 
formed  in compliance  with our local Institutional  Review  Board, and all 
subjects  provided  written  informed  consent.  
2.2. MR imaging  and parameters  mapping  
MRI experiments  were performed  on a 3T whole body Philips MRI 
system (Achieva,  Best, The Netherlands)  using the internal  quadrature  
body coil for transmission  and an eight-channel  phased-array  head coil

Fig. 1. Schematic  illustrating  the various pipelines  within 
the HAPPE software  package.  
There is now an extensive  collection  of automated  EEG process-  
ing pipelines  (e.g., Andersen  2018 ; APP, da Cruz et al. 2018 ; MADE, 
Debnath  et al. 2020 ; EEG-IP-L,  Desjardins  et al. 2021 ; HAPPE,  Gabard-  
Durnam  et al. 2018 ; Hatz et al. 2015 ; FASTER,  Nolan et al. 2010 ; Au- 
tomagic,  Pedroni  et al. 2019 ; EPOS, Rodrigues  et al. 2020 ). However,  
their reliance  on independent  component  analysis  (ICA) to segregate  
and correct artifacts  makes them unsustainable  for low-density  data, 
as the limited number  of channels  provides  insuﬃcient  independent  
components  for robust artifact  isolation.  Many of these pipelines  also 
use standard  deviation-dependent  approaches  to identify  outlier data 
or channels  as artifact-contaminated.  These approaches  may require  
modiﬁcation  to scale down to low-density  setups with few channels.  
Other software  tools built into these fully-automated  pipelines  to aid 
in diﬀerent  stages of artifact  detection  are most eﬀective  when used 
with high-density  data or have not been validated  in low-density  data 
(PREP, Bigdely-Shamlo  et al. 2015 a; SASICA,  Chaumon  et al. 2015 ; 
Adjusted-ADJUST,  Leach et al. 2020 ; ADJUST,  Mognon  et al. 2011 ; ASR, 
Mullen et al. 2013 ; MARA,  Winkler  et al. 2014 ). A recent automated  
mega-analysis  by Bigdely-Shamlo  et al. (2020) introduced  a pipeline  
that supports  both high-density  and low-density  data, but only at the 
upper bound of low-density  channel  layouts.  Speciﬁcally,  they tested 
their pipeline  using data sets ranging  from a Neuroscan  30-channel  
headset  (Compumedics  Neuroscan)  to a Biosemi  256-channel  headset  
(Biosemi  B.V.), but found that the density  of the headset  accounted  
for variability  in the channel  amplitudes  across datasets  after process-  
ing. Several  pipelines  automate  the processing  of strictly low-density  
data. Of these options,  some are made speciﬁcally  for a particular  pop- 
ulation ( Cassani  et al., 2017 ) or acquisition  systems  (e.g., James Long 
EEG Analysis  System software,  Whedon  et al. 2020 ). Others use inde- 
pendent  component  analysis  to correct artifacts  ( Hajra et al., 2020 ), 
which cannot support  many low-density  setups. Still others oﬀer only 
artifact-rejection  approaches  (e.g., channel  and/or segment  rejection),  
some of which target only speciﬁc  classes of artifact  (e.g., eye-blink  
artifacts),  and these artifact-rejection  methods  can cause signiﬁcant  
data loss without  artifact-correction  in continuous  data ﬁrst (e.g., EEG 
Analysis  System software  (James Long Company),  MINIMADE,  Troller-  
Renfree  et al. 2021 ). Thus, there remains  a need for standardized  pro- 
cessing solutions  to serve the range of low-density  EEG conﬁgurations  
in use and the range of artifacts  that occur in EEG data. 
To address  this need, we propose  a novel pipeline  for low-density  
EEG data (fewer than 32 channels)  called HAPPILEE  (Harvard  Auto- 
mated Pre-processing  Pipeline  Including  Low-Electrode  Encephalogra-  
phy). We apply contemporary  approaches  to optimize  line noise reduc- 
tion, bad channel  detection,  artifact  correction  from continuous  data, 
segmentation,  and bad segment  rejection  methods  to suit low density  datasets.  HAPPILEE  is embedded  in the HAPPE  software  package,  which 
facilitates  pre-processing  for a variety of analyses  and data types ( Fig. 1 ). 
To facilitate  ERP analyses  on low density  data, HAPPILEE  interfaces  with 
the HAPPE  + ER pipeline  within HAPPE  ( Monachino  et al., 2021 ). Be- 
cause modiﬁcations  for ERP analyses  are not density-dependent  (with 
the exception  of the optional  bad channel  detection  step, which uses 
HAPPILEE  optimization  criteria  for low density  ERP analyses),  spe- 
ciﬁc details on the optimization  of this software  for ERP analyses  can 
be found in Monachino  et al. (2021) . The following  sections  of this 
manuscript  describe  HAPPILEE’s  processing  steps and outputs,  assess 
optimization  of these steps for low-density  EEG, and demonstrate  HAP- 
PILEE’s  eﬀectiveness  with a low-density  developmental  EEG dataset and 
simulated  EEG signals relative  to other pre-processing  approaches  (see 
Fig. 2 for full pipeline  schematic).  
1.1. Optimization  dataset 
The various  steps of the HAPPILEE  automated  pipeline  were 
optimized  using a subset of developmental  EEG ﬁles from the 
Bucharest  Early Intervention  Project (BEIP) (for full study design, 
see Zeanah  et al. 2003 ). The EEG ﬁles contributing  to this example  
dataset may be freely assessed  at: https://zenodo.org/record/5,088,346  
( Lopez et al., 2021 ). We selected  the BEIP dataset as its study de- 
sign facilitated  testing HAPPILEE  on EEG data from children  across 
a range of caregiving  conditions,  behavioral/clinical  phenotypes,  and 
ages ( Zeanah  et al., 2009 ). The optimization  dataset includes  resting-  
state EEG from three groups of children  living in Romania  starting  in 
2001. The ﬁrst group, referred  to as the Care as Usual Group (CAUG),  
is composed  of children  living across six institutionalized  care facilities  
throughout  Bucharest,  Romania.  The second group is the Foster Care 
Group (FCG), which is composed  of children  who were removed  from 
these institutions  through  random  assignment  and placed in a foster care 
intervention.  The ﬁnal group is the Never Institutionalized  Group (NIG), 
made up of a community  sample of children  living with their biological  
families  who have never been placed in institutionalized  care or fos- 
ter care. We selected  a subset of thirty EEG ﬁles across the three groups 
from the greater dataset (CAUG,  n = 8; FCG, n = 8, NIG, n = 14). The av- 
erage age at the start of the baseline  assessment  across the three groups 
was 17.40 months,  with a range of 6.28–29.98  months  (averages  per 
group: CAUG = 18.30; FCG = 16.21; NIG = 17.58).  The resting-state  EEG 
for all children  was recorded  with the James Long system from twelve 
scalp sites (F3, F4, Fz, C3, C4, P3, P4, Pz, O1, O2, T7 and T8) using a 
lycra Electro-Cap  (Electro-Cap  International  Inc., Eaton, OH) with sewn- 
in tin electrodes  (the two mastoid  sites, M1 and M2, were removed  due 
to poor recording  quality across the dataset).

processing  step in the light blue boxes. The user options for resampling,  segmentation,  bad data interpolation,  segment  rejection,  and re-referencing  steps and 
visualizing  several steps in HAPPILEE  with the semi-automated  setting are also indicated.  
1.2. HAPPILEE  data inputs 
HAPPILEE  accommodates  multiple  types of EEG ﬁles with diﬀerent  
acquisition  layouts  as inputs. A single run will support  only a single ﬁle 
type across ﬁles, speciﬁed  by the user. For .set formated  ﬁles, the cor- 
rect channel  locations  should be pre-set and embedded  in the ﬁle (e.g. 
by loading  it into EEGLAB  and conﬁrming  the correct locations)  prior 
to running  through  HAPPILEE.  When running  .mat formated  ﬁles, you 
must have a ﬁle with channel  locations  speciﬁed  in your folder in order 
to run all steps in the HAPPILEE  pipeline.  If channel  locations  are not 
provided,  you will not be able to do the following:  ﬁlter to channels  of 
interest,  detect and reject bad channels,  interpolate  bad channels,  or re- 
reference  your data. Each batch run of HAPPILEE  must include  ﬁles col- 
lected with the same channel  layout (company,  net type, and electrode  
number)  and paradigm  (resting-state  or event-related),  each of which 
users must specify for a given run. HAPPILEE  processes  data collected  
with any sampling  rate, and ﬁles within a single run may diﬀer in their 
individual  sampling  rates (if this is the case, we strongly  recommend  
selecting  the option to resample  data to the same frequency  to ensure 
subsequent  steps perform  comparably  across ﬁles regardless  of original  
sampling  rate).

dle, parvocellular  central,  and multiform  or paralamellar  lateral parts 
( Mitchell  and Chakraborty,  2013 ; Ray and Price, 1992 ). In the human 
brain, Morel’s  histological  atlas of the thalamus  identiﬁed  three dis- 
tinct subdivisions  in the MD ( Morel et al., 1997 ). Another  human his- 
tological  atlas described  a dense cellular  caudodorsal  region of the MD 
( Ding et al., 2016 ). Compared  to the traditional  histological  studies,  the 
subregions  could also be discerned  by the main structural  connections  
using in vivo diﬀusion  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (dMRI)  ( Klein et al., 
2010 ; Phillips  et al., 2019 ). Furthermore,  by calculating  the connectiv-  
ity pattern  of the subregion,  the connectivity  between  the subregion  and 
a set of target regions  can be quantitatively  characterized  ( Cheng et al., 
2018 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ; Zhuo et al., 2016 ). Hence, a connectivity-based  
approach  may more accurately  reﬂect the structural  topography  of the 
MD. 
Moreover,  a large number  of studies on animal experiments  and in- 
jury studies have conﬁrmed  an important  role of the MD in cognition  
from a functional  perspective.  Animal  models have emphasized  that, 
because  of its robust structural  interconnections  with other brain ar- 
eas, the MD is essential  in integrating  various  aﬀective  behaviors  and in 
cognitive  processing  (for review,  ( Georgescu  et al., 2020 ; Pergola  et al., 
2018 ). Previous  lesion studies on human patients  revealed  that neuro- 
logical and psychiatric  diseases  such as schizophrenia  are related to in- 
juries of diﬀerent  parts of the MD and that the interaction  between  the 
damaged  part and the cortex may lead to diﬀerent  aspects  of cogni- 
tive impairment,  such as the disruption  of executive  function  and learn- 
ing deﬁcits  ( Alelú-Paz  and Giménez-Amaya,  2008 ; Mitchell  et al., 2007 ; 
Ouhaz et al., 2018 ; Pergola  et al., 2013 ; Victor, 1989 ). In healthy  hu- 
mans, few neuroimaging  studies have investigated  the functions  of the 
MD. Precise subregions  can provide  cognitive  insights  about a brain re- 
gion in that the interactions  between  spatially  distributed  brain regions  
are taken into account,  which might be the cause of complex  behaviors  
( Zimmermann  et al., 2018 ). Therefore,  it is necessary  to see whether  the 
connections  of diﬀerent  subregions  relate to diﬀerent  cognitive  func- 
tions 
In this study, we aimed to identify  and characterize  the subregions  
of the human MD and explore  the underlying  behaviors  of each MD 
subregion  using in vivo MRI data. We ﬁrst obtained  a robust parcella-  
tion of the human MD based on its whole-brain  anatomical  connectivity  
conducted  on a representative  high-resolution  dataset from the Human  
Connectome  Project (HCP). Then we explored  the anatomical  and func- 
tional connectivity  of each subregion  with the rest of the brain. Finally,  
a partial least squares  correlation  (PLSC) model was used to explore  
the relationships  between  each subregion’s  functional  connectivity  and 
human behavioral  measures.  The goal of this study was to provide  a 
comprehensive  description  of the MD, which could beneﬁt brain inter- 
ventions  and treatment  in clinical  situations.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Subjects  
We used 40 unrelated  subjects  (age: 22–35, 20 male) from the 
HCP database  for a connectivity-based  segmentation  of the MD. De- 
tailed demographic  information  about these subjects  was described  
previously  ( Fan et al., 2016 ). To characterize  the connectivity  pat- 
tern of each subregion  and its relationship  with behaviors,  the data 
from 1012 healthy  young adults (age: 22–35; 469 males) with both 
diﬀusion  and functional  imaging  data were extracted  from the S1200 
subjects  release of the WU-Minn  HCP Consortium  ( Van Essen et al., 
2013 ), The data for the subjects  were collected  using a Siemens  3T 
scanner  (Siemens,  Erlangen,  Germany)  with a 32-channel  head coil. 
The scanning  procedures  and parameters  are described  in detail in 
Van Essen et al. (2013) and also provided  in the supplementary  ma- 
terials. In this study, 59 behavioral  measures  (Supplementary  Table 
S1) were used to explore  the brain-behavior  relationships  ( Tian and 
Zalesky,  2018 ). A detailed  description  of the measures  is available  at https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/HCP  + Data + Dictionary  + P
+ Updated  + for + the + 1200 + Subject  + Release  
2.2. Data preprocessing  
Diﬀusion  MRI: The HCP diﬀusion  images with 1.25 mm isotropic  
spatial resolution  were preprocessed  by the HCP diﬀusion  pre- 
processing  pipeline  using the FMRIB diﬀusion  toolbox  (FSL 5.0; 
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl  ). The main steps are as follows:  nor- 
malization  of b0 image intensity  across runs and correction  for echo- 
planar imaging  (EPI) susceptibility,  eddy-current-induced  distortions,  
gradient-nonlinearities,  and subject motion.  The probability  distribu-  
tions of the ﬁber orientations  were estimated  using FSL’s BEDPOSTX  
algorithm  ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ). Next, skull-stripped  T1-weighted  im- 
ages for each subject were co-registered  to the subject’s  b0 images using 
FSL’s FLIRT algorithm.  Then we derived  linear and nonlinear  transfor-  
mations  between  the T1 image and the Montreal  Neurological  Institute  
(MNI) structural  template.  Based on these, we derived  (forward  and in- 
verse) transformations  between  the diﬀusion  space and the MNI space, 
which were then used to transform  the seed masks into the diﬀusion  
space for each subject.  
Resting-state  fMRI: There were four 15-minute  rs-fMRI  scans for 
each subject.  All the images were visually  inspected  and minimally  pre- 
processed  by HCP personnel  before release (e.g., distortion  corrected,  
coregistered,  and warped  to MNI and CIFTI grayordinate  templates;  see 
Glasser  et al. (2013) for details).  Whole-brain  connectivity  analyses  were 
performed  using rs-fMRI  data in CIFTI grayordinate  space, which rep- 
resents the cortex using surface meshes  (32k vertices  per surface)  and 
the subcortex  using 3D MNI coordinates  (2 mm isotropic  spatial resolu- 
tion). The ROI time-series  were extracted  from the unsmoothed  rs-fMRI  
data in the MNI space. The rs-fMRI  data were bandpass  ﬁltered  (0.1 - 
0.01 Hz). To spatially  smooth  the data, a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian  kernel 
was applied  only to the cortical  surface using Connectome  Workbench  
version  1.2.4 ( Marcus  et al., 2011 ).

Due to the rapidly  growing  popularity  of the HARDI technique  for 
tractography,  the inﬂuences  of b value (strength  of the diﬀusion  gra- 
dient), angular  resolution  (number  of gradient  directions),  and spatial 
resolution  associated  with tractography  have been investigated  in both 
human and monkey  brains ( Aydogan  et al., 2018 ; Daianu  et al., 2015 ; 
Jones et al., 2020 ; Schilling  et al., 2017a , 2018 , 2017b ; Tournier  et al., 
2013 ). White matter ﬁber orientations  of monkey  brain were sensitive  to 
both the number  of diﬀusion  directions  (angular  resolution)  and b value 
( Schilling  et al., 2017b ). It has been reported  that there was negligible  
improvement  in accuracy  when the b value of the single shell was in- 
creased  from 6000 to 12,000 s/mm 2 , or when the number  of directions  
was increased  from 64 to 96 ( Schilling  et al., 2018 ). Jones et al. reported  
that single-shell  dMRI data can yield the same accuracy  as multi-shell  
data for axonal orientation  measurements  if the reconstruction  approach  
was chosen carefully  ( Jones et al., 2020 ). The accuracy  remained  stable 
across dMRI voxel sizes of 1 mm or smaller  but degraded  at 2 mm, partic- 
ularly in areas of complex  white-matter  architecture  ( Jones et al., 2020 ). 
These studies provide  quantitative  measures  of the reliability  and limita- 
tions of dMRI acquisition  and reconstruction  methods,  and can be used 
to identify  the advantages  of competing  approaches  as well as poten- 
tial strategies  for improving  accuracy  for ﬁber orientation  distributions  
( Li et al., 2016 ; Maier-Hein  et al., 2017 ). However,  most of these studies 
focus on small areas of the white matter.  Alterations  due to the diﬀerent  
acquisition  parameters  to the whole brain structural  connectome  are not 
fully investigated  ( Anderson  et al., 2020 ; Caiazzo  et al., 2018 ). 
High spatial resolution  dMRI has been developed  to validate  ad- 
vanced ﬁber orientation  distribution  reconstruction  methods  with light 
microscopy  imaging  methods  ( Lefebvre  et al., 2017 ; Mollink  et al., 2017 ; 
Roebroeck  et al., 2019 ). The high spatial resolution  dMRI of human 
specimens  has been achieved  at 250 𝜇m isotropic  resolution,  where each 
voxel still contains  thousands  of neurons  ( Jones et al., 2020 ). In contrast,  
the spatial resolution  can be improved  for the rodent brain in small- 
bore preclinical  magnets  with high-performance  gradient  coil, close- 
ﬁtting radiofrequency  (RF) coils, and optimized  MR pulse sequences  
( Calabrese  et al., 2015 ; Roebroeck  et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2018a ; 
Wu and Zhang, 2016 ). The dMRI of ex vivo postnatal  mouse brains pro- 
vided excellent  contrasts  revealing  the evolutions  of mouse forebrain  
structures  at the spatial resolution  of 94 ×96 ×93 𝜇m 3 ( Zhang et al., 
2005 ). With the isotropic  spatial resolution  of 52 𝜇m, Aggarwal  et al. 
were able to visualize  the complex  microstructure  of embryonic  cerebral  
tissue and resolve its regional  and temporal  evolution  during cortical  
formation  ( Aggarwal  et al., 2015 ). High-resolution  diﬀusion  MRI and 
tractography  can reveal macroscopic  neuronal  projections  in the mouse 
hippocampus  and are important  for future development  of advanced  
tractography  methods  ( Wang et al., 2020 ; Wu and Zhang, 2016 ). 
In this study, we acquired  HARDI datasets  in ex vivo mouse brains 
on diﬀerent  MRI platforms  (Varian  platform  and Bruker platform).  In 
particular,  we acquired  a high-spatial  resolution  dMRI dataset (25 𝜇m 
isotropic  with 126 DWIs), which we believe  to be the highest  spatial 
resolution  yet obtained  ( Wang et al., 2020 ); and a high-angular  resolu- 
tion dMRI dataset (50 𝜇m isotropic  with 384 DWIs), which we believe  
to be the highest  angular  resolution  compared  to the dMRI datasets  at 
the microscopic  resolution  ( Alomair  et al., 2015 ; Aydogan  et al., 2018 ; 
Johnson  et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2013 ; Wu and Zhang, 2016 ; Yon et al., 
2020 ). We systematically  investigated  the eﬀects of three important  pa- 
rameters  to the ﬁnal connectome  outcome:  spatial resolution,  angular  
resolution,  and b value, in order to provide  a foundation  for exploring  
the tradeoﬀs  among these acquisition  parameters  for the structural  con- 
nectome  in rodents.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Animal preparation  
Animal  experiments  were carried out in compliance  with the Duke 
University  Institutional  Animal  Care and Use Committee.  Eight wild- type adult C57BL/6  mice (Jackson  Laboratory,  Bar Harbor,  ME) were 
choose for MR imaging:  7 mice were scanned  using Varian scanner  
and 1 mouse was scanned  using Bruker scanner.  For Varian scanner,  
one mouse was scanned  at 25 𝜇m isotropic  resolution  with b value of 
3000 s/mm 2 ; one mouse was scanned  with 8 shells at 50 𝜇m isotropic  
resolution  ( Wang et al., 2019 ); Five mice were scanned  with 2 shells at 
50 um isotropic  resolution.  For Bruker scanner,  one mouse was scanned  
with 2 shells at 100 um isotropic  resolution.  Animals  were sacriﬁced  and 
perfusion  ﬁxed with a 1:10 mixture  of ProHance-buﬀered  (Bracco  Diag- 
nostics,  Princeton,  NJ) formalin.  Specimens  were immersed  in buﬀered  
formalin  for 24 h and then moved to a 1:200 solution  of ProHance/saline  
to shorten  T1 (to about 110 ms) and reduce scan time ( Wang et al., 
2018a ). 
2.2. MR histology  protocol  
MR images of 7 mice were acquired  on a 9.4T Oxford 8.9-cm vertical  
bore magnet  (Oxford  Instruments,  Abingdon,  United Kingdom)  with an 
Agilent  VnmrJ 4.0 imaging  console.  A homemade  solenoid  RF coil was 
used for the scans. We used a three-dimensional  (3D) diﬀusion-weighted  
spin-echo  pulse sequence  that was modiﬁed  to support  k-space  under- 
sampling  and varying  b values with diﬀerent  gradient  directions.  A 3D 
compressed  sensing  (CS) strategy  fully sampled  the readout  dimension  
and under sampled  the phase encoding  dimensions  using a sparsifying  
approach,  which has been described  in detail previously  ( Wang et al., 
2018a ). Acceleration  factors (AF) of 1.0, 5.12 and 8.0 were used in this 
study, where 1.0 stands for the fully sampled  data. To achieve  multi- 
shell diﬀusion  MRI acquisition,  the diﬀusion  gradient  orientations  were 
determined  using the method  proposed  by Koay et al. to ensure the uni- 
formity  within each shell while maintaining  uniformity  across all shells 
( Koay et al., 2012 ). 
Four protocols  were developed  in this study, three were on Varian 
platform  and one was on Bruker platform.  The three protocols  used for 
Varian platform  were: 1) One dataset (AF = 8.0) was acquired  using a 
single-shell  acquisition  (b value = 3000 s/mm 2 ) at 25 𝜇m isotropic  res- 
olution,  126 DWIs and 13 b0 images,  and one repetition.  Total scan time 
was about 127 h. 2) One dataset (AF = 5.12) was acquired  with 8 shells 
(b value = 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000 s/mm 2 ) at 
50 𝜇m isotropic  resolution,  48 DWIs and 4 b0 images in each shell, and 
one repetition.  The total scan time was 148 h. 3) 5 datasets  (AF = 8.0) 
were acquired  with 2 shells (3000 and 8000 s/mm 2 ) at 50 𝜇m isotropic  
resolution,  61 DWIs and 6 b0 images in each shell, and one repetition.  
The total scan time was 47.7 h. The DWIs of 5 mouse brains at b value 
of 3000 and 8000 s/mm 2 were shown in Supplemental  Figure 1. The 
temperature  was monitored  throughout  all the scans and ﬂuctuation  
was less than 1 °C. All the scans kept the same TE of 15.2 ms and TR 
of 100 ms. Gradient  separation  time was 7.7 ms, the diﬀusion  gradient  
duration  time was 4.8 ms, and the maximum  gradient  amplitude  was 
134 G/cm. 
MR images of one mouse brain was acquired  on a 30-cm bore 
9.4T magnet  (Bruker  BioSpec  94/30, Billerica,  MA). A high-sensitivity  
cryogenic  RF surface receive-only  coil was used for signal reception  
(Bruker  CryoProbe).  The protocol  used for Bruker platform  was: a 
three-dimensional  (3D) diﬀusion-weighted  spin-echo  pulse sequence  
was used for imaging  acquisition  with the scan parameters:  two shells 
(b value = 3000 and 8000 s/mm 2 ), 100 𝜇m isotropic  resolution,  61 
DWIs and 6 b0 images in each shell, and one repetition.  The total scan 
time was 41 h. Details of the acquisition  parameters  are summarized  in 
Table 1 . 
To assess the eﬀect of angular  resolution,  the diﬀusion  dataset ac- 
quired using protocol  1 was subsampled  from 10 to 110 gradient  orienta-  
tions. To assess the eﬀect of spatial resolution,  the same dataset was also 
down sampled  to 50, 100, and 200 𝜇m isotropic  resolution  in k-space.  To 
assess the eﬀect of b value, the diﬀusion  dataset acquired  using protocol  
2 was subsampled  to single shell (from 1000 to 8000 s/mm 2 ), two shells 
(1000 and 2000s/mm  2 , 3000 and 4000 s/mm 2 , 5000 and 6000 s/mm 2 ,

proposes  that the positive  and negative  ﬁeld deﬂections  within an oscil- 
latory episode  arise from competing  proximal  and distal thalamocortical  
drives ( Sherman  et al., 2016 ). The timing and occurrence  rate of these 
events (i.e., event rate ) play an important  role in sensory  perception  as 
well as the planning  and execution  of voluntary  movement  ( Brady et al., 
2020 ; Heideman  et al., 2020 ; Little et al., 2019 ; Seedat et al., 2020 ; 
Shin et al., 2017 ). Primarily,  beta events occurring  close in time to a sen- 
sory stimulus  impair the perception  of the stimulus  ( Shin et al., 2017 ) 
while events occurring  close to a visual cue delay movement  initiation  
( Little et al., 2019 ). Furthermore,  the beta event rate modulations  over a 
motor task mimic the spectral  power dynamics  associated  with beta ERD 
and ERS ( Brady et al., 2020 ; Little et al., 2019 ; Seedat et al., 2020 ). Beta 
event rate also plays a role in brain disease;  namely  individuals  with 
Parkinson’s  disease  show robust diﬀerences  in beta event rate during 
movement  preparation  compared  to healthy  controls  ( Heideman  et al., 
2020 ) while patients  with schizophrenia  exhibit a lower post-movement  
beta event rate compared  to healthy  controls  ( Gascoyne  et al., 2021 ). At 
rest, evidence  suggests  the temporal  coincidence  of events plays a funda- 
mental role in driving  the known electrophysiological  beta connectome  
( Seedat et al., 2020 ). 
Recent work by our group ( Brady et al., 2020 ; Power and Bar- 
douille,  2021 ) analyzes  age-related  trends in sensorimotor  transient  
beta events characteristics  during a motor task (i.e., unilateral  button 
press) and at rest using MEG data from the Cambridge  Center for Age- 
ing and Neuroscience  (Cam-CAN)  cross-sectional  study of healthy  age- 
ing (n = 596, ages 18–88) (M. M.A. Shafto et al., 2014 ; Taylor et al., 
2017 ). We found that the peak power of the events showed  an n-shaped  
quadratic  ageing trajectory,  the peak frequency  of the events showed  a 
linear decrease  with age, and the frequency  span of events showed  a u- 
shaped quadratic  ageing trajectory.  These trends were found both at rest 
and during the various  phases of the button press. The beta event rate 
on the other hand showed  a slight linear decrease  with age at rest but a 
linear increase  with age during the pre-movement  interval,  suggesting  
that thalamocortical  activity  is underpinned  by a strong interaction  be- 
tween age and task engagement.  As the beta event characteristics  show 
a variety of ageing trajectory  functional  forms, the results of our recent 
work ( Brady et al., 2020 ) hint at the unique functional  signiﬁcance  of 
beta event characteristics  beyond  just the event rate. 
The aperiodic  behaviour  of neuroelectrophysiological  signals has not 
been as widely studied  as the rhythmic  behaviour.  This is primarily  due 
to diﬃculties  in measuring  aperiodic  signals and thus connecting  them 
to neurological  generators  (B. J. He et al., 2010 ). The aperiodic  activity  
generally  manifests  as a 1∕ 𝑓 𝜒distribution  in the neural power spectral  
density  (PSD), where the power drops oﬀ exponentially  as a function  
of frequency,  𝑓. The aperiodic  exponent,  𝜒, reﬂects  the steepness  of 
the falloﬀand  is typically  around a value of one. The steepness  of the 
frequency  fall-oﬀ has  been shown to decrease  (i.e., the PSD ﬂattens)  
with waking  compared  to sleep ( Freeman  and Zhai, 2009 ) and decrease  
with engagement  in a visuomotor  task ( Podvalny  et al., 2015 ). Further-  
more, resting-state  ageing studies have shown adults have ﬂatter neu- 
ral spectra  compared  to children  (W. He et al., 2019 ) and older adults 
have ﬂatter spectra  compared  to younger  adults in the visual cortex, 
which may facilitate  age-related  impairments  in visual working  mem- 
ory ( Voytek et al., 2015 ). The PSD shape has additionally  been found to 
be a bio-marker  for brain disease,  including  schizophrenia  ( Racz et al., 
2021 ), Attention  deﬁcit hyperactivity  disorder  ( Ostlund  et al., 2021 ; 
Robertson  et al., 2019 ), as well as Gilles de la Tourette  syndrome  
( Münchau  et al., 2021 ). In addition  to the aperiodic  exponent  𝜒, the 
neural PSD is determined  by a power oﬀset parameter,  𝑏 , which reﬂects  
the aperiodic  baseline  power levels. As evidence  of its functional  sig- 
niﬁcance  continues  to accumulate  in the scientiﬁc  literature,  previous  
reports labelling  the aperiodic  activity  as a type of “neural  noise ”a r e 
potentially  unjustiﬁed.  In fact, recent work in computational  model- 
ing shows that the aperiodic  exponent  (i.e., the steepness  of the fre- 
quency  fall-oﬀ)  is associated  with the ratio of excitatory  (ex. AMPA)  to 
inhibitory  (ex. GABA) synaptic  currents,  where a ﬂatter PSD indicates  a higher excitatory  to inhibitory  ratio ( Gao et al., 2017 ). The aperiodic  
oﬀset has been shown to correlate  with the rate of single-neuron  spiking  
( Manning  et al., 2009 ). 
Evidence  for the functional  signiﬁcance  of rhythmic  and aperiodic  
neuroelectrophysiological  activity  is now bountiful  in the scientiﬁc  lit- 
erature.  It is thus imperative  to separate  rhythmic  and aperiodic  data 
in signal analysis  pipelines  to avoid conﬂating  eﬀects and the misin- 
terpretation  of the underlying  neurophysiological  mechanisms.  Such a 
scientiﬁc  challenge  has motivated  the recent development  of the ‘fooof’ 
(ﬁtting oscillations  & one over f) algorithm  which is designed  to pa- 
rameterize  neural PSDs into their rhythmic  and aperiodic  components  
( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ). Isolating  aperiodic  and periodic  brain activ- 
ity using the fooof technique  is an eﬀective  approach  of assessing  their 
functional  roles. For instance,  Ouyang  et al. (2020) found that dissoci-  
ating alpha oscillations  from 1/f activity  revealed  a strong relationship  
between  1/f activity  and between-person  variability  in cognitive  speed –
an association  that is mistaken  to originate  from alpha oscillations  when 
applying  conventional  spectral  analysis  techniques.  Isolating  aperiodic  
and periodic  brain activity  has also shown that simultaneous  changes  in 
both components  can underpin  changes  in functional  and behavioural  
processes.  For example,  Thuwal  at al. (2021) found that both periodic  
and aperiodic  features  correlate  with visual short-term  memory  (VSTM)  
task measures  - the aperiodic  features  being associated  with more global 
changes  in information  processing  and the periodic  features  reﬂecting  
more local changes  in selective  aspects  of the VSTM task. Changes  in 
both the aperiodic  and periodic  features  over the adult lifespan  were 
found to align well with an age-related  decline  in VSTM task perfor- 
mance.  An extension  of the fooof parameterization  approach  to ana- 
lyze sensorimotor  signals may be extremely  valuable  to elucidate  neu- 
rophysiological  underpinnings  of the ageing sensorimotor  network.  This 
is challenging  however  as the fooof algorithm  is designed  to operate  on 
time-averaged  signals while sensorimotor  rhythmic  activity  presents  as 
a series of short-lasting  transient  events. An integrated  approach  to pa- 
rameterize  neurophysiological  recordings  into their transient  event and 
aperiodic  components  is thus necessary  to comprehensively  investigate  
the ageing sensorimotor  network.  
In this work, we demonstrate  the periodic/aperiodic  parameteriza-  
tion of transient  oscillations  (PAPTO).  PAPTO  is a transient  event detec- 
tion algorithm  that intrinsically  disambiguates  transient  event events 
from the background  aperiodic  activity.  PAPTO  works on the basis that 
the amplitude  power threshold  for detecting  events is calculated  as a 
multiple  of the modeled  aperiodic  activity  power spectrum.  The objec- 
tives of this work are (1) to motivate  and validate  the PAPTO  algorithm,  
and (2) to use PAPTO  to disambiguate  adult lifespan  changes  in the ape- 
riodic activity  power spectrum  and transient  event characteristics.  We 
assess changes  across the adult lifespan  using resting-state  MEG data 
from the Cam-CAN  cross-sectional  study of healthy  ageing (n = 600, ages 
18–88).  Primarily,  we show that PAPTO  is more sensitive  to neocortical  
transient  beta rhythms  compared  to beta events detected  via a conven-  
tional median  power amplitude  threshold  technique.  We additionally  
ﬁnd that PAPTO  captures  more variance  in the resting-state  beta event 
occurrence  rate across participants.  The improved  sensitivity  of PAPTO  
reveals that the beta occurrence  rate almost doubles  over the adult lifes- 
pan which we discuss in terms of thalamocortical  beta generation  in the 
somatosensory  cortex and the age-related  decline  of sensory  perception.  
The valuable  new insights  gained in our investigation  of the ageing hu- 
man sensorimotor  network  suggests  that PAPTO  should be extended  to 
other neurophysiological  signals,  such as transient  events across the en- 
tire neuroelectrophysiological  frequency  spectrum  and how they change 
with age, disease,  and task performance.

2.1. Participants  & experimental  paradigm  
Six hundred  and forty-seven  participants  had eyes-closed  resting-  
state MEG data recorded  for 8 min and 40 s (ﬁrst 20 s discarded)  in 
Phase 2 of the Cam-CAN  examination  of healthy  cognitive  ageing.  Par- 
ticipant  ages ranged from 18 to 88 years of age, with an equal distri- 
bution in age per decile and equal proportions  of males and females.  
Most participants  were right hand dominant.  Following  exclusions  (de- 
scribed  under sections  “MEG pre-processing  ”and “MRI data analysis  & 
anatomical  ROI timecourse  estimation  ”), we report ﬁndings  from 600 
participants  (93% of the original  647 datasets).  
2.2. Data acquisition  
Data were obtained  from the Cam-CAN  repository  (available  at 
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/datasets/camcan/  ) (M. M.A. Shafto 
et al., 2014 ; Taylor et al., 2017 ). MEG data were acquired  at 1000 Hz 
with inline band-pass  ﬁltering  between  0.03 and 330 Hz using a 306- 
channel  Vectorview  system with continuous  head position  monitoring  
(Elekta Neuromag,  Helsinki,  Finland).  Digitization  of anatomical  land- 
marks (i.e., ﬁducial  points; nasion and left/right  preauricular  point) as 
well as additional  points on the scalp was also performed  for regis- 
tration of MEG and MRI coordinate  systems.  Electrooculogram  (EOG) 
and electrocardiogram  (ECG) were recorded  concurrently.  T1-weighted  
magnetic  resonance  images were acquired  using a 3T Siemens  Tim Trio 
system with a 32-channel  head coil

Larkin and Knutson,  2015 ). Finally,  aging may degrade  glutamatergic  
projections  from the mPFC to the striatum,  compromising  value integra-  
tion ( Samanez-Larkin  and Knutson,  2015 ). 
In the present  study, we aim to explore  the temporal  resolution  of 
EEG to identify  age-related  diﬀerences  in neural correlates  associated  
with the processes  proposed  by the AIM framework.  To this purpose,  
younger  and older adults performed  a version  of the Monetary  Incentive  
Delay (MID) task ( Knutson  et al., 2000 ), adapted  to the event-related  po- 
tential (ERP) technique  of EEG ( Broyd et al., 2012 ). The MID task allows 
the identiﬁcation  of core brain networks  involved  in diﬀerent  stages of 
anticipatory  and reward processing.  During this task, participants  are 
presented  with a cue that signals possible  gains and losses. This cue 
is followed  by a perceptually  undemanding  target detection,  which re- 
quires a button press to win or avoid losses. Then, feedback  reveals the 
success  or failure of the performance  ( Knutson  et al., 2000 ). Thereby,  
the MID task allows studying  the mechanisms  that precede  choice pro- 
posed by the AIM framework.  The cue signaling  gains or losses elicits 
anticipatory  aﬀective  processes,  which are integrated  with further con- 
siderations  to inﬂuence  motivation  processes  that promote  the motor 
response  required  by the target. 
A number  of recent studies further showed  the utility of the electro-  
physiological  version  of the MID task (e-MID)  for the temporal  decom-  
position  of the brain activity  during anticipatory,  target, and outcome  
stages of decision-making  ( Broyd et al., 2012 ; Flores et al., 2015 ; Hill 
et al., 2018 ; Novak and Foti, 2015 ; Oumeziane  et al., 2017 ; Pfabigan  et 
al., 2014 ). Moreover,  one of these studies used the e-MID task to show 
that several ERPs related to reward anticipation  and feedback  process-  
ing deteriorate  with age ( Hill et al., 2018 ). 
In our work, we used the e-MID task and EEG to further identify  
age-diﬀerences  in the neural correlates  of the main components  of the 
AIM framework,  in particular,  gain/loss  anticipation,  value integration,  
and motivational  processes  linked to motor responses,  as well as the 
processing  of positive/negative  rewards.  In what follows,  we introduce  
our main components  of interest  and expected  patterns  of age diﬀer- 
ences that we derive from the AIM framework  and related aging litera- 
ture. We see our work as a contribution  to establishing  AIM as a helpful 
framework  to understand  age diﬀerences  in decision-making.  
First, to examine  the anticipatory  neural responses,  we analyzed  the 
P3 evoked  by cues (cue-P3),  that is a centroparietal  positivity  correlated  
with the engagement  of proactive  cognitive  control ( Bekker et al., 2004 ), 
which increases  in function  of the reinforcement  amount  ( Goldstein  et 
al., 2006 ). Concerning  the eﬀects of aging, the cue-P3 of older adults 
typically  exhibits  less diﬀerentiation  based on the signiﬁcance  of the cue 
( Hämmerer  et al., 2010 ; Kropotov  et al., 2016 ), and increased  latencies  
( Kray et al., 2005 ). 
Second,  to examine  the integration  process  of the value, we ana- 
lyzed the contingent  negative  variation  (CNV), a frontocentral  negative  
potential  induced  by a cue signaling  the future presentation  of an im- 
perative  stimulus.  It can be divided  into an earlier component  (‘orient-  
ing’ O wave), related to the alerting  properties  of the cue, and a later 
component  (‘expectancy’  E wave), associated  with the engagement  of ef- 
fortful processes  to future motor responses  ( Brunia et al., 2011 ; Brljnia 
and Vingerhoets,  1981 ; Van Boxtel and Bocker,  2004 ). The CNV appears  
to be modulated  by motivation  ( Cant and Bickford,  1967 ; Irwin et al., 
1966 ), cognitive  eﬀort ( Falkenstein  et al., 2003 ; Gómez et al., 2007) and 
salience  of the stimuli ( Baas et al., 2002 ; Klorman  and Ryan, 1980 ). It is 
modulated  by the presence  of monetary  incentives,  being larger for in- 
centive  than for non-incentive  cues (see, for instance,  Schevernels  et al., 
2016 , 2014 ). The CNV is more negative  in older adults than younger  
adults, particularly  during demanding  tasks ( Kray et al., 2005 ; Wild- 
Wall et al., 2007 ). 
Despite  the studies cited above, only Schmitt  et al. (2015) examined  
the eﬀects of monetary  incentives  on the cue-P3 and CNV in younger  and 
older adults. The authors  found that gains and losses elicited  more pos- 
itive cue-P3 than neutral  cues in both groups,  but this eﬀect was larger 
in younger  adults. Regarding  the CNV, only younger  adults showed  am- plitudes  more negative  after cues anticipating  losses than after neutral  
cues, while cues anticipating  gain and neutral  trials induced  similar am- 
plitudes  in both groups.  Building  upon this study ( Schmitt  et al., 2015 ), 
we hypothesized  a more positive  cue-P3 after cues anticipating  gains 
and losses than after neutral  cues, both in younger  and older adults 
(H1). We also hypothesized  a more negative  CNV after cues anticipating  
losses than cues anticipating  neutral  and gain trials in younger  adults, 
while predicting  similar CNV amplitudes  for cues anticipating  the three 
conditions  in older adults (H2). 
Third, to examine  the motivational  processes  behind motor choices,  
we analyzed  the Lateralized  Readiness  Potential  (LRP) and the target-P",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(4997, 5000), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(5826, 5828), match='3.'>"

or temporal  resolution  –a s well as on limiting  artifacts.  In particular,  
movements  of external  tissues (e.g., chest, jaw, etc.) can be detrimental  
as they introduce  temporal  variations  in ﬁeld inhomogeneity,  and thus 
lead to distortions  and blurring  of the images along the phase-encoding  
(PE) direction  ( Saritas et al., 2014 ). 
Since the seminal  work of Yoshizawa  in 1996 ( Yoshizawa  et al., 
1996 ), a number  of studies have implemented  diﬀerent  methodolo-  
gies to circumvent  these impediments  (see Eippert  et al., 2017a; Pow- 
ers et al., 2018; Stroman  et al., 2014; Summers  et al., 2014; Wheeler-  
Kingshott  et al., 2014 for reviews).  Nevertheless,  the heterogeneity  of 
the employed  strategies  has, so far, precluded  the emergence  of stan- 
dardized  guidelines.  Notably,  most of the early studies were conducted  
using non-standard  acquisition  techniques,  favoring  a contrast  mecha-  
nism termed signal enhancement  by extravascular  water protons  (SEEP) 
( Stroman  et al., 2001a , 2001b ), in place of the well-established  BOLD 
contrast.  The SEEP technique,  relying on T2-weighted  spin-echo  MRI, 
was suggested  to provide  a better image quality.  The ﬁndings  related to 
this contrast  mechanism  are, however,  controversial  and several groups 
unsuccessfully  tried to reproduce  these results ( Bouwman  et al., 2008 ; 
Jochimsen  et al., 2005 ; Moﬃtt et al., 2005 ). Nowadays,  T2 ∗ -weighted  
gradient-echo-planar  imaging  (EPI), prevalent  in brain fMRI to image 
BOLD signal, is most commonly  used for spinal cord fMRI, though ap- 
proaches  such as multi-shot  3D fast-ﬁeld  echo imaging  have recently  
shown promising  results ( Barry et al., 2021 ). 
Although  gradient-echo  EPI allows rapid imaging  and high signal-to-  
noise ratio, it is particularly  sensitive  to susceptibility  variations,  promi- 
nent in the spinal cord due to the various  surrounding  tissues (Powers  
et al., 2018) . Several  techniques  have been proposed  to mitigate  these 
artifacts  and, thus, to maximize  signal quality.  For instance,  spinal cord 
imaging  can beneﬁt from methods  limiting  the extent of the ﬁeld-of-  
view (FOV) in the PE direction  (i.e., anterior-posterior),  so that signals 
from external  tissues are not included.  A simple implementation  for this 
is to use a standard  sequence  with outer volume  suppression  (OVS), 
which consists  in the application  of saturation  bands located  externally  
to the cord ( Wilm et al., 2007 ). This technique  was employed  in a num- 
ber of fMRI studies,  with promising  results ( Eippert  et al., 2017b , 2009 ; 
Geuter and Büchel,  2013 ; Kong et al., 2014 ; Sprenger  et al., 2012 ; van de 
Sand et al., 2015 ). Alternatively,  inner FOV imaging  can be achieved  
through  dynamic  pulses speciﬁcally  exciting  the region-of-interest  in the 
PE direction.  This method  is now implemented  in most scanners  under 
diﬀerent  denominations  (e.g., ZOOMit  for Siemens,  FOCUS for GE or 
iZOOM  for Philips).  Since encoding  is limited to the targeted  region, it 
allows for reduced  acquisition  time and high spatial resolution,  while 
reducing  susceptibility  artifacts.  As a matter of fact, the applicability  
of inner FOV approaches  has been widely demonstrated  for diﬀusion  
weighted  imaging  of the spinal cord ( Alizadeh  et al., 2017; Finsterbusch,  
2012; Samson  et al., 2016; Saritas et al., 2008; Wheeler-Kingshott  et al., 
2002; Zaharchuk  et al., 2011 ). More recently,  several fMRI studies also 
underlined  their potential  to image spinal cord function  ( Kinany et al., 
2020 , 2019 ; Weber et al., 2020 , 2016a , 2016b ). Notwithstanding  the 
compelling  results,  both using OVS and inner FOV techniques,  there is 
yet no consensus  as regards  optimal  acquisition  parameters,  general-  
izability  across sequences,  nor diﬀerences  in performance.  Addressing  
these questions  can, therefore,  oﬀer a stepping  stone to larger multi- 
centric studies aiming to establish  a reproducible  pipeline  to image 
spinal cord function  , similarly  to recent eﬀorts in proposing  an accessible  
and reliable  pipeline  for quantitative  MRI to probe spinal cord structure  
( Cohen-Adad  et al., 2021a , 2021b ). 
To this end, we systematically  compared  three common  spinal cord 
fMRI protocols  during a simple motor paradigm  (wrist adduction),  pre- 
viously  demonstrated  to elicit localized  activity  ( Kinany et al., 2019 ), 
and at rest. Speciﬁcally,  we selected  one standard  sequence  that uses 
outer volume  suppression  (OVS), as well as two inner FOV implementa-  
tions (ZOOMit),  with diﬀerent  spatiotemporal  resolutions.  Capitalizing  
on state-of-the-art  processing  tools tailored  to the spinal cord (e.g., phys- 
iological  noise correction,  common  template,  slice-wise  motion correc- tion, etc.) ( De Leener et al., 2017 ; Eippert  et al., 2017 a), we evaluated  
the suitability  of the three sequences  to detect task-evoked  and spon- 
taneous  activity,  using analytical  approaches  on par with brain stan- 
dards. Our results allowed  us to assess the characteristics  of these ac- 
quisition  schemes,  while probing  the robustness  of spinal cord fMRI re- 
sults against  variations  in the acquisition  pipeline.  These investigations  
represent  an important  step towards  the development  of a reliable  and 
generalizable  pipeline  for spinal cord fMRI. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Sixteen  healthy  volunteers  were enrolled  in this study. All subjects  
had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and no history of neurolog-  
ical or motor disorders.  One participant  had to be excluded  due to 
technical  problems  (misalignment  of the imaging  stack). The ﬁnal sam- 
ple consisted  of 15 participants  (8 female,  28.9 ± 4.2 years old). The 
study had been approved  by the Commission  Cantonale  d’Éthique  de 
la Recherche  Genève  (CCER, Geneva,  Switzerland,  2016–01,566).  All 
participants  gave their written  informed  consent  to participate.  
2.2. Experimental  paradigms  
During the experiment,  each participant  performed  two task runs 
and one rest run for each acquisition  scheme.  During the task runs, sub- 
jects were asked to execute  a bilateral  wrist adduction  movement  (i.e., 
wrist towards  the outside,  with an ulnar deviation).  In a previous  study, 
we had demonstrated  through  a combination  of electromyographic  and 
fMRI recordings  that this movement  elicited  localized  spinal activity  
(Kinany  et al., 2019) . Within each run, movements  were performed  in 
blocks of 18 s (8 blocks of rest alternated  with 8 blocks of movement  
and a ﬁnal block of rest) and an entire run lasted approximately  ﬁve 
minutes.  Instructions  were displayed  on a screen (ﬁxation  cross ‘ + ’ dur- 
ing the rest blocks and text indicating  ‘movement  repetitions’  during the 
task blocks).  Auditory  cues were used to inform the subject of the dif- 
ferent phases,  as well as to ensure a uniform  rhythm  across participants  
(10 movements  per block). Rest runs (i.e., no overt task) lasted 7 min 
and 30 s. For all subjects,  the experiment  was carried out with the fol- 
lowing structure:  Rest A / Run 1A –Run 1B –Run 1C / Rest B / Run 2A 
–Run 2B –Run 2C / Rest C. A, B, C corresponded  to the three types of 
acquisition  and were randomized  over subjects.

UCSF IRB approved  this study under #13-12079.  Algorithms  
used in this study can be found in ( https://github.com/grinberglab/  
high- res- 3D- tau ). Fig. 1 illustrates  the workﬂow  steps. 2.1. Specimen  Procurement,  Histological  Processing  and brain slabbing  
We tested the entire pipeline  using two whole human brains. The 
ﬁrst specimen,  Case 1, belonged  to a 88 years-old  cognitively  nor- 
mal donor with moderate  AD pathology  (AD neuropathologic  change 
A2B2C1  score ( Montine  et al., 2012 )). The second specimen,  Case 2, be- 
longed to a 76 years-old  donor diagnosed  with dementia  and severe AD 
pathology  (AD neuropathologic  changes  A3B3C3  score). Case 1 under- 
went postmortem  MPRAGE  MRI acquisition,  while Case 2 underwent  
postmortem  SPGE acquisition  within 10 hours of death ( Fig. 1 a). To 
minimize  tissue deformation,  upon autopsy,  we stored the specimens  up- 
side down, hanging  by the circle of Willis for three days. After that, we 
mounted  them in plastic skulls, 3D-printed  from the patient’s  comput-  
erized tomography  (CT) images.  Fixation  continued  for 18 days inside a 
bucket ﬁlled with buﬀered  4% paraformaldehyde  ( Alegro et al., 2016 ). 
Next, the specimens  were embedded  in celloidin.  The brains were sec- 
tioned in serial sets of coronal  slides, each set containing  four 160 𝜇m- 
thick sections.  The section thickness  was selected  to balance  the risk 
of tissue tear and the eﬃciency  of antibody  penetration.  Representa-  
tive 2 ×1 ”celloidin  samples  were cut for paraﬃn  embedding  for neu- 
ropathological  diagnosis  ( Alegro et al., 2016 ). During sectioning,  digital 
photographs  were acquired  directly  from the blockface  following  each 
stroke using a high-deﬁnition,  computer-controlled  DSLR camera  (EOS 
5D Mark II, Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted  on a copy stand arm (Kaiser 
Fototechnik,  Germany)  ( Fig. 1 b). During processing,  brain tissue shrank 
about 30 to 40%. Thus, each coronal  PET scan voxel would contain  at 
least two complete  histological  sets, opening  the opportunity  to probe 
multiple  antibodies  per voxel. Details of tissue processing  celloidin  em- 
bedding  and cutting have been described  by us elsewhere  ( Alegro et al., 
2016 ; Alegro et al., 2017 ; Theoﬁlas  et al., 2014 ). 
2.2. CT and MRI acquisition  
Postmortem  structural  T1-weighted  MR imaging  of Case 1 was per- 
formed  on a 3T Siemens  Skyra MRI system with a transmit  and 32- 
channel  receive  coil using a 3D MPRAGE  T1-weighted  sequence  with 
the following  parameters:  TR/TE/TI  = 2300/2.98/900ms,  176 sagittal  
slices, within plane FOV = 256 ×240mm  2 , voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1mm 3 , 
ﬂip angle = 9°, bandwidth  = 240Hz/pix.  
Postmortem  structural  T1-weighted  MR imaging  of Case 2 was per- 
formed  on a GE Discovery  3T MR750  system with a transmit  and 32- 
channel  receive  coil using a 3D SPGR T1-weighted  sequence  with the 
following  parameters:  TI = 400ms,  200 sagittal  slices, within plane 
FOV = 256 ×256mm  2 , voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1mm 3 , ﬂip angle = 11°, 
bandwidth  = 31.25Hz/pix.  
CT was acquired  in life with a slice thickness  of 1.25 mm, reconstruc-  
tion diameter  of 300 mm, and image matrix of 512 ×512 and only used 
as a model for the 3D printed  skull ( Fig. 1 b)

scale, the network  representation  can encode brain regions  interlinked  
by structural  connections  or statistical  associations  between  their activ- 
ity ( Park and Friston,  2013a ). At each scale, the network  representation  
oﬀered by graph theory provides  a mathematical  language  —and formal 
statistical  tools —to understand  a key feature of neural systems:  their 
interconnected  nature. 
Appropriate  for description  at multiple  scales, graph theory provided  
a way of answering  the “What ”q u e s t i o n :  “What do brain graphs look 
like, and what makes them diﬀerent  from one another?  ”Initially  focus- 
ing on the degree distribution,  clustering  coeﬃcient,  path-length,  and 
small-worldness,  the ﬁeld began to determine  how brain graphs were 
similar to (or diﬀerent  from) canonical  graphs studied  in mathematics  
( Bassett and Bulmore,  2006; Bullmore  and Sporns,  2009 ). Eﬀorts also 
sought to determine  how brain graphs diﬀered  with age, disease,  or un- 
der the eﬀects of diﬀerent  drugs ( Fornito  et al., 2015; Kaiser, 2017 ). 
In a second wave of studies,  investigators  focused  on evaluating  modu- 
lar organization,  and the presence  of a rich-club  of densely  connected  
core areas surrounded  by a sparsely  interconnected  periphery  ( Colizza  
et al., 2006; Sporns and Betzel, 2016; van den Heuvel and Sporns,  2011 ). 
The capacity  to measure,  distinguish,  and characterize  interconnection  
patterns  as graphs quickly  opened  up new avenues  of inquiry  in neu- 
roscience,  oﬀering  novel insights  into brain structure,  function,  and de- 
velopment  ( Bassett et al., 2017; Betzel et al., 2016a; Sporns,  2013 ), as 
well as the ﬂow of information  ( Fornito  et al., 2016a; Sporns and Bet- 
zel, 2016 ). Simultaneously,  the question  arose as to what simple rules 
could be stipulated  to create synthetic  graphs that reproduced  the con- 
nectional  features  displayed  by the brain. Eﬀorts to answer this ques- 
tion drew on the development  of generative  models,  which could re- 
capitulate  structural  features  of real networks  such as small-worldness  
( Watts and Strogatz,  1998 ), a heavy-tailed  degree distribution  ( Albert, 
2005; Barabasi  and Albert, 1999 ), and community  structure  ( Fortunato,  
2010; Newman  and Girvan,  2004 ). However,  it quickly  became  clear 
that the generative  models available  from network  science  had largely 
been developed  for social systems  where edges might be abstract  con- 
cepts like friendship.  In contrast,  neural units are connected  by struc- 
tural links that develop  through  physically  constrained  processes  of cell 
migration  and synapse  formation,  and further face energetic  constraints  
on both maintenance  and use ( Bullmore  and Sporns,  2012 ). These dis- 
tinctions  between  the constraints  of social and neural systems  moti- 
vated eﬀorts to examine  the nature of a brain graph’s  physical  embed-  
ding ( Kaiser and Hilgetag,  2006; Stiso and Bassett,  2018 ). The growing  
consideration  of physical  constraints  and resilience  to physical  lesions 
changed  the way we thought  about brain network  architecture  and de- 
velopment,  its support  of cognitive  processes,  and its alterations  in dis- 
ease ( Bassett et al., 2009; Kaiser and Hilgetag,  2004; Park and Friston,  
2013b; Sporns,  2013 ). 
Generative  models and studies of physical  constraints  on wiring 
shared a common  motivation:  to determine  the drivers that might ex- 
plain the “Why ”o f brain graphs,  in contrast  to simply the “What ”. Of 
course answers  to “Why do brain graphs have this particular  topology?  ”
could come in at least two ﬂavors:  “Because  there exist rules for —and 
constraints  upon —their formation  ”and “Because  that topology  provides  
functional  aﬀordances  for the adult organism.  ”Generative  models and 
studies of physical  constraints  clearly oﬀered candidate  answers  of the 
former type. How could the ﬁeld assess the existence  of candidate  an- 
swers of the latter type? Many studies reported  individual  or group- 
level diﬀerences  in brain graph architecture  and their correlations  with 
diﬀerences  in behavior,  cognition,  and symptoms  ( Fornito  et al., 2017; 
Medaglia  et al., 2016; Sporns,  2014 ). More recently,  such studies have 
been able to capitalize  on advances  in machine  learning  to build predic- 
tive models that identify  network  features  that forecast  cognitive  abili- 
ties, symptoms,  or measures  of behavior  ( Dosenbach  et al., 2010; Finn 
et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2018 ). 
While “What ”and “Why ”questions  are clearly important  and serve 
to guide much of science,  the ﬁeld of network  neuroscience  has also grown to ask more questions  about “How ”( Bassett and Sporns,  2017a ). 
How does neural activity  travel along structural  connections  ( Avena- 
Koenigsberger  et al., 2017 )? How does the brain move around the acces- 
sible state space ( Deco et al., 2011 ), and how is that movement  depen- 
dent on the graph’s  architecture  ( Cornblath  et al., 2020 )? How do intrin- 
sic and extrinsic  perturbations  aﬀect the system?  Can they be designed  to 
maximize  a functional  outcome?  Eﬀorts to answer these sorts of “How ”
questions  have drawn on control theory as often applied  to technologi-  
cal, robotic,  and physical  systems  ( Srivastava  et al., 2020 ). The frame- 
work of control theory concerns  itself with determining  optimal  control 
strategies  to drive speciﬁc  changes  in the system state, thereby  illumi- 
nating the design principles  that facilitate  control ( Kailath,  1980a; Tang 
and Bassett,  2018a ). In the context  of the brain, the approach  has proven 
useful in understanding  intrinsic  processes  such as cognitive  control ( Cui 
et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017 ), detecting  transitions  to 
altered states in health and disease  ( Santanielloa  et al., 2011; 2012 ), 
and guiding  extrinsic  processes  such as neuromodulation  ( Santanielloa  
et al., 2018; Stiso et al., 2019 ). Combining  the framework  of control 
theory with network  descriptions  has provided  new insights  into the 
spatiotemporal  organization  of the brain, the evolution  of network  ar- 
chitecture  during development,  and the alteration  of brain dynamics  in 
neurological  conditions  and psychiatric  disorders  ( Li et al., 2019; San- 
tanielloa  et al., 2011; 2012; Tang and Bassett,  2018b ). Current  and fu- 
ture research  at the intersection  of control theory and network  neuro- 
science  seeks to inform extrinsic  perturbative  strategies  (e.g., optimal  
neuromodulation  techniques)  and intrinsic  perturbative  strategies  (e.g., 
cognitive  control).  
In following  the trajectory  of the ﬁeld over the past few years, it 
seems timely to review recent expansions  of network  neuroscience  be- 
yond its early methodological  focus on graph theory. The expansions  
serve to more fully and more intentionally  ask “What ”, “Why ”, and 
“How ” questions.  To ensure brevity,  here we focus on the three areas 
of (i) descriptive  network  neuroscience,  (ii) predictive  network  neuro- 
science,  and (iii) perturbative  network  neuroscience,  drawing  on the 
principles  of control theory developed  in systems  engineering  ( Fig. 1 ). 
In each focal area, we primarily  consider  the type of insights  that net- 
work neuroscience  can potentially  provide  and outline the approaches  
adopted  in recent studies.  The review is not meant to be comprehensive  
in delineating  all relevant  approaches  to “What ”, “Why ”, and “How ”
questions.  Rather,  it aims to provide  a perspective  on the manner  in 
which network  neuroscience  has been —and is —growing  beyond  graph 
theory, in ways that make new sorts of answers  to these questions  both 
possible  and accessible.  A key and relevant  topic that we choose not 
to address  here is inference  , and that choice is motivated  by two fac- 
tors: the sheer size of the inference  problem  and associated  literature  
(which would be diﬃcult  to do justice to in a readable  short piece span- 
ning the other spaces we wished to cover), and partly related to our 
alternative  perspective  from dynamical  systems  (rather than statistics),  
where perturbation  is absolutely  central and complementary  to descrip-  
tion and prediction.  We look forward  to future reviews  that can do jus- 
tice to integrating  the topic of inference  into the existing  and emerg- 
ing approaches  that we canvass  here. More broadly,  the literature  we 
canvass  comes predominantly  from humans,  although  the methods  we 
discuss can be applied  across organisms,  models,  and modalities.  Our 
question-based  approach  allows us to provide  a unique contribution  to 
the current  literature.  While previous  reviews  have focused  on the in- 
tellectual  pillars of the ﬁeld (e.g., Bassett and Sporns,  2017b; Griﬀa and 
Van den Heuvel,  2018 ), intersections  of the ﬁeld with other ﬁelds (e.g., 
Cao et al., 2017; Fornito  et al., 2017; Morgan  et al., 2018 ), and more spe- 
ciﬁc mathematical  methods  (e.g., Bijsterbosch  et al., 2021; Preti et al., 
2017 ), here in this review we foreground  question-motivated  praxis, 
homing  in on pragmatic  concerns  in the ﬁeld today. This focus naturally  
motivates  a consideration  of what sorts of explanations  network  neuro- 
science  can provide,  and hence we close with a brief discussion  of this 
topic.

Fig. 1. Application  and extensions  of graph theory to problems  in neuro- 
science.  Frameworks  from graph theory are used extensively  to build increas- 
ingly realistic descriptions  of the brain, make predictions  about brain function  
or organism  behavior,  and design control strategies  to support desired dynam- 
ics. Both the structural  connections  between  brain regions and their correlated  
functions  can be represented  as networks  using graph theory. Then such graphs 
can be described  quantitatively  using graph statistics.  Descriptive  approaches  
can be complemented  by predictive  approaches,  wherein  network  factors are 
identiﬁed  that can be used to accurately  predict distinctive  phenotypes,  for ex- 
ample along the dimensions  of age, sex, cognition,  symptoms,  or behavior.  Fi- 
nally, descriptive  and predictive  approaches  can be complemented  by pertur- 
bative approaches,  wherein  control theory is used to understand  the impact of 
perturbations  and predict strategies  of desired brain-state  transitions.  
2. Descriptive  network  neuroscience  
The brain is inherently  organized  into a set of structurally  and func- 
tionally  coherent  regions  that interact  with one another.  This property  
has thus made the brain an ideal system to model as a network  ( Bassett 
et al., 2018b; Butts, 2009; Fornito  et al., 2016a ). Indeed,  network  sci- 
ence has provided  invaluable  insights  by elucidating  the various  struc- 
tural and functional  properties  of the brain. The approach  has further 
oﬀered a formal means by which to investigate  how the brain’s under- 
lying structural  architecture  shapes its emergent  functional  expression  
( Fornito  et al., 2016a; Park and Friston,  2013b ). In this section,  we will 
focus on the brain imaging,  statistical,  and dynamical  systems  method-  
ologies that have been adapted  to describe  the brain’s structural  and func- 
tional connectivity  patterns.  
2.1. The structural  connectome  
We begin by addressing  the question  of how to describe  the brain’s 
anatomical  architecture  using the tools of graph theory in the ﬁeld of 
network  neuroscience.  For this particular  purpose,  researchers  have fo- 
cused on two complementary  brain imaging  modalities:  structural  and 
diﬀusion  neuroimaging.  Structural  sequences,  including  T1-weighted  
magnetic  resonance  imaging  sequences  (MRIs),  are most commonly  
used to quantify  macroscale  structural  markers  such as cortical  thickness  
and gray matter volume,  due to their high contrast  between  gray and 
white matter.  Diﬀusion-weighted  MRIs are used to assess the presence  
and attributes  of white matter ﬁbers physically  connecting  diﬀerent  re- 
gions across the brain. Both structural  and diﬀusion  sequences  can then be employed  to construct  the brain’s structural  connectome  : a comprehen-  
sive mapping  of its structural  connectivity  patterns  ( Fig. 2 , left ). Note, 
connectomes  derived  from T1-weighted  MRIs are based on covariance  
in regional  structural  properties  and are referred  to as morphometric  
networks  ( Morgan  et al., 2019; Seidlitz  et al., 2018 ). 
The structural  connectome  is formally  represented  as a matrix 
(namely  𝐺) with equal numbers  of rows and columns,  where each row 
and column  indicates  a brain region (more commonly  referred  to as a 
network  node ) and each matrix entry 𝐺 𝑖𝑗 (more commonly  referred  to 
as a network  edge ) captures  how strongly  nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗are connected  
to each other ( Fornito  et al., 2016a ). Edges can take on diﬀerent  deﬁ- 
nitions,  depending  on which imaging  modality  is being used to quan- 
tify them. For instance,  if T1-weighted  MRIs are utilized,  then the edge 
between  two brain regions  usually  represents  the statistical  similarity  
in their corresponding  macroscale  anatomical  markers  (e.g., cortical  
thickness,  gray matter volume,  or surface area). Similarly,  if diﬀusion-  
weighted  MRIs are used, then the edge between  two brain regions  usu- 
ally represents  the number,  density,  or diﬀusion  properties  (e.g., frac- 
tional anisotropy,  apparent  diﬀusion  coeﬃcient)  of white matter tracts 
connecting  these regions  ( Fornito  et al., 2016a ). Such measurements  can 
now be quantiﬁed  by a variety of image processing  pipelines  and asso- 
ciated software  packages  such as DSI Studio ( Yeh et al., 2013 ), QSIPrep  
( Cieslak  et al., 2021 ), MRTRIX  ( Tournier  et al., 2019 ), BEDPOSTx  and 
probtrackx  via FSL ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ), and TRACULA  via FreeSurfer  
( Maﬀei et al., 2021; Yendiki  et al., 2011 ). 
Indeed,  over the past few decades,  diﬀusion-weighted  imaging  (DWI) 
has evolved  into one of the cardinal  neuroimaging  methodologies  to 
non-invasively  capture  white matter organization  and the microstruc-  
tural integrity  of the brain ( Le Bihan and Johansen-Berg,  2012 ). By 
measuring  the Brownian  motion of water molecules,  DWI assesses  the 
magnitude  and direction  of molecule  diﬀusion  across each brain voxel. 
Software  packages  such as the ones mentioned  above, can then be used 
to analyze  the corresponding  diﬀusion  patterns  across the brain, gen- 
erate quantitative  estimates  of ﬁber orientations  within each voxel and 
across multiple  directions,  and utilize these estimates  to infer properties  
of white matter ﬁber tracts connecting  any two voxels ( Baliyan  et al., 
2016; Cieslak  et al., 2018 ). 
Determining  the most biologically  accurate  way to reconstruct,  or 
‘track,’ the underlying  white matter tracts has been a topic of intense  re- 
search. Common  tractography  approaches,  including  deterministic  and 
probabilistic  tractography,  have been employed  to investigate  structural  
connectivity  patterns  in health and disease  ( Cieslak  et al., 2018; For- 
nito et al., 2016b; Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg,  2011; Jeurissen  et al., 
2019; Milano et al., 2019; Sarwar et al., 2019; Sotiropoulos  and Zalesky,  
2019; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Brieﬂy,  deterministic  tractography  algorithms  
typically  start at a seed voxel, identify  its preferred  ﬁber orientation,  
and generate  streamlines  by connecting  consecutive  voxels according  
to their preferred  directions  until a stopping  criterion  is met. The to- 
tal number  of streamlines  passing  between  any two regions  can then 
be counted  to deﬁne their structural  connectivity.  In contrast,  proba- 
bilistic tractography  considers  not only the most probable  ﬁber orien- 
tation at each voxel, but also all other possible  orientations.  Probabilis-  
tic tractography  algorithms  typically  start at a seed voxel where they 
randomly  pick one of the ﬁber orientations  that has been estimated  
within that voxel. Then, a streamline  is propagated  along a neighbor-  
ing voxel, where a ﬁber orientation  is once again randomly  chosen from 
that voxel’s available  distribution.  The streamline  propagation  continues  
along multiple  voxels, up until one of the designated  stopping  criteria  
has been reached.  This general  process  is repeated  multiple  times with a 
diﬀerent  starting  ﬁber orientation.  From a probabilistic  standpoint,  the 
structural  connectivity  between  two regions,  A and B, is then deﬁned  as 
the ratio of [streamlines  originating  from voxels in region A that reach 
voxels in region B] to [the total number  of simulated  streamlines  gen- 
erated from region A]. 
Recently,  a third type of tractography  has been proposed  that calcu- 
lates connectivity  probabilities  between  brain regions  without  relying

Fig. 2. Distinct  connection  types produce  diﬀerent  connectomes  whose architecture  may be described.  The three most common  types of connectivity  utilized 
to elucidate  the brain’s patterns  of connectional  organization  and communication  include structural,  functional,  and eﬀective  connectivity.  Structural  connectivity  
between  two brain regions assesses the presence  and density of white matter ﬁbers physically  connecting  them. Functional  connectivity  between  two brain regions is 
deﬁned as the statistical  similarity  between  their functional  signal time-series.  Eﬀective  connectivity  combines  the notions of structural  and functional  connectivity  
along with biophysical  modeling  to infer directional  (i.e., causal) inﬂuences  between  brain regions. After choosing  a type of connectivity  and extracting  a connectome,  
graph statistics  can be used to describe  the topology  of the observed  interconnection  patterns.  
on extensive  simulations.  This analytic  tractography  approach  derives  
closed-form  solutions  to the tracking  problem,  which can be used to di- 
rectly calculate  voxel-to-voxel  transition  probabilities,  given the voxels’ 
orientation  distribution  functions  and certain biologically-rooted  geo- 
metric constraints  ( Cieslak  et al., 2018 ). These analytic  transition  prob- 
abilities  can then be used as the edge weights  of the structural  connec-  
tome ( Greene et al., 2019 ). 
2.2. The functional  connectome  
An analogous  approach  has been utilized  to describe  the brain’s 
functional  connectivity  patterns  and construct  its corresponding  func- 
tional connectome  ( Fig. 2 , middle ). The imaging  modalities  most exten- 
sively used to accomplish  this goal have been resting-state  and task- 
based functional  MRIs, as they detect ﬂuctuations  in blood-oxygen-  
level-dependent  contrast,  thus indirectly  inferring  neuronal  activation  
patterns  across the brain ( Logothetis,  2008 ). Other popular  imaging  
modalities  that have been used to map the brain’s functional  con- 
nectome  include  functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy  (fNIRS),  elec- 
troencephalography  (EEG) ( De Vico Fallani et al., 2006; Micheloyannis  
et al., 2006; Stam and Reijneveld,  2007 ), and magnetoencephalography  
(MEG) ( Bastos and Schoﬀelen,  2016; Stam, 2004 ). Similarly  to func- 
tional MRIs, fNIRS evaluates  the brain’s cortical  hemodynamic  response  
following  neuronal  activation  by measuring  changes  in hemoglobin  con- 
centration  using near-infrared  light ( Hu et al., 2020 ). EEG is an electro-  
physiological  technique  used to record the macroscopic  electrical  ac- 
tivity of the brain, presumably  generated  by the voltage  diﬀerentials  
(i.e., dipoles)  induced  by groups of pyramidal  neurons  ﬁring in tandem  
( Bastos and Schoﬀelen,  2016; Murakami  and Okada, 2006 ). In contrast,  
MEG assesses  the brain’s functional  activity  by recording  the magnetic  
ﬁelds generated  by the underlying  electrical  currents  ( Hillebrand  et al., 
2012; Murakami  and Okada, 2006 ). 
In comparison  to structural  connectomes,  the edges in functional  
connectomes  are typically  set to denote the statistical  similarity  (e.g., 
inter-regional  correlation  or covariance;  spectral  coherence)  between  
the regions’  respective  functional  time-series.  A positive  edge thus in- 
dicates a positive  statistical  relationship  between  the functional  activ- 
ity time-series  of two brain regions,  whereas  a negative  edge signiﬁes  
a negative  statistical  relationship.  Depending  on the modality  used and 
the scientiﬁc  question  being asked, the functional  time-series  can reﬂect 
changes  in hemodynamic  signals (functional  MRIs and fNIRS) or diﬀer- 
ent frequency  bands of electrical  signals (EEG and MEG). The presence  
of statistical  interdependence  between  the functional  signals of two re- 
gions is thought  to indicate  a physiological  interaction  between  them; critically,  brain regions  whose signals are systematically  correlated  with 
each other are referred  to as functionally  coupled  ( Eickhoﬀand  Müller,  
2015; McIntosh,  2010 ). More speciﬁcally,  a positive  edge weight could 
indicate  functional  cooperation  or informational  integration,  whereas  a 
negative  edge weight could indicate  functional  antagonism  or informa-  
tional segregation  ( Fornito  et al., 2016b ). Notably,  the functional  con- 
nectivity  between  two regions  can characteristically  ﬂuctuate  even dur- 
ing short time periods  (on the order of seconds),  in contrast  to their 
anatomical  connectivity  which tends to remain relatively  ﬁxed on the 
time scales of months  and years ( Cabral et al., 2017; Fox and Raichle,  
2007 ). For this reason,  the brain’s functional  connectivity  over time is 
often portrayed  using multilayer  networks,  where each layer captures  a 
snapshot  of the system’s  functional  connectivity  during one pre-deﬁned  
time window  ( Kivela et al., 2014; Vaiana and Muldoon,  2020 ). 
More generally,  ﬂuctuations  in functional  connectivity  have been a 
topic of marked  interest.  Such ﬂuctuations  are referred  to as dynamic  (or 
time-varying;  rather than static) functional  connectivity,  and can occur 
over a range of time scales. Dynamic  functional  connectivity  has been 
assessed  in recent literature  using two primary  approaches:  empirical  
data-based  and model-based  ( Calhoun  et al., 2014; Lurie et al., 2020; 
Preti et al., 2017 ). The former category  includes  analyzing  the empir- 
ically measured  functional  neuroimaging  data (e.g., BOLD, EEG) and 
examining  how the properties  of the functional  connectome  reorganize  
over time. One popular  empirical-based  method  is the sliding-window  
approach.  Instead  of estimating  functional  connectivity  across the full 
duration  of the functional  scan, the scan is split into shorter time win- 
dows with or without  any temporal  overlap,  and functional  connectiv-  
ity is estimated  for each time window.  This method  can be particularly  
useful, for instance,  if the goal is (i) to examine  how temporal  ﬂuctu- 
ations in functional  connectivity  between  brain regions  correlate  with 
cognitive  engagement  and behavioral  performance,  (ii) to assess diﬀer- 
ences in the ﬂexibility  of functional  connectivity  between  patient and 
healthy  control groups,  (iii) to further investigate  the topological  and 
dynamical  properties  of the functional  connectome  by comparing  it to 
an appropriately  designed  null model, or to (iv) identify  any stable func- 
tional connectivity  ‘states’ that emerge  throughout  the functional  scan 
( Gonzalez-Castillo  and Bandettini,  2018; Lurie et al., 2020; Preti et al., 
2017 ). 
In contrast,  model-based  algorithms  used to estimate  dynamic  func- 
tional connectivity  typically  do so by ﬁtting a wide variety of biophys-  
ical models to the empirical  functional  time-series.  Such models can 
then be critically  used to gain valuable  intuition  into the biological  
mechanisms  underlying  neurons’  temporal  functional  expression  pat- 
4  P. Srivastava,  P. Fotiadis, L. Parkes et al. NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119250 
terns (for a detailed  list of diﬀerent  workﬂows  used to study dynamic  
functional  connectivity,  associated  papers,  and methodological  consid-  
erations,  see Refs. Hutchison  et al., 2013; Lurie et al., 2020; Preti et al., 
2017; Zhang et al., 2021a ). Notably,  recent studies have demonstrated  
that both empirical  and model-based  dynamic  functional  connectivity  
approaches  generally  exhibit high test-retest  reliability  —albeit  lower 
than static functional  connectivity  —across  diﬀerent  datasets  and atlases 
( Abrol et al., 2017; Choe et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; 2021b ). 
Deﬁning  the functional  connectivity  between  two distinct  anatomi-  
cal regions  as the statistical  correlation  between  their functional  signal 
time-series  has been a particularly  fruitful and popular  approach,  and 
for good reason.  It is conceptually  intuitive,  methodologically  straight-  
forward,  and its results can be clearly interpreted.  This methodology  
does, however,  come with certain caveats:  (i) the brain regions  need to 
be deﬁned  a priori , (ii) a strong correlation  between  two brain regions’  
signal time-series  could be the result of both regions  being under the 
same external  inﬂuence,  while not necessarily  being strongly  function-  
ally coupled  to each other, and (iii) even though this functional  connec-  
tivity approach  sheds light on the pairwise  interactions  among brain re- 
gions, it may not always optimally  identify  more global functional  brain 
networks,  depending  on how such networks  are conceptually  deﬁned.  
To address  these potential  shortcomings,  complementary  methodolo-  
gies have been proposed  in the literature,  which aim to extract unique 
functional  connectivity  patterns  at the whole-brain  scale. Three broad 
categories  —independent  component  analysis  (ICA), singular  value de- 
composition  (SVD), and clustering-based  approaches  —have been par- 
ticularly  prominent  ( Van Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010 ). ICA-based  ap- 
proaches  are commonly  employed  to decompose  the functional  MRI 
signals across the brain into maximally  independent  spatial brain maps 
and their associated  time courses;  each spatial map captures  a diﬀerent  
signal pattern  and can be used to separate  true activation  from artifact  
( De Luca et al., 2006; McKeown  et al., 2003 ). Such spatial maps can 
then be used to examine  organizational  principles  underlying  healthy  
brain function  ( Calhoun  et al., 2009; Kiviniemi  et al., 2011; Smith et al., 
2012a; Varoquaux  et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013; Yaesoubi  et al., 2015 ) 
or diﬀerences  between  healthy  and patient cohorts  ( Bi et al., 2018; Du 
et al., 2020; Dujardin  et al., 2020; Durieux  and Wilderjans,  2019; Ma 
et al., 2014 ). SVD is conceptually  and mathematically  similar to ICA, 
and assesses  functional  connectivity  patterns  in the brain by transform-  
ing them into a new coordinate  system where diﬀerent  axes of functional  
signal variation  are captured;  this methodology,  therefore,  enables  the 
identiﬁcation  of regions  of voxels that co-vary  their functional  signal 
time-series  in a similar fashion  ( Ahlheim  and Love, 2018; Caﬀo et al., 
2010; Friston,  1994; Krishnan  et al., 2011; Worsley  et al., 2005 ). Results 
obtained  from ICA- and SVD-based  approaches  can be more diﬃcult  to 
interpret  than results from the temporal  correlation  approach,  as they 
typically  capture  more abstract  spatial brain maps rather than speciﬁc  
anatomically  deﬁned  brain regions  ( Caﬀo et al., 2010; Van Den Heuvel 
and Pol, 2010 ). 
Complementing  the ICA and SVD approaches,  clustering  methods  
aim to group brain voxels into an optimal  number  of clusters  based on 
how similar their anatomical  and functional  signal properties  are to each 
other ( Craddock  et al., 2015; Preti et al., 2017; Thirion  et al., 2014; Van 
Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010 ). Of course, the words ‘optimal’  and ‘simi- 
lar’ can take on diﬀerent  meanings  depending  on the speciﬁc  clustering  
methodology  being used. K-means  clustering  ( Allen et al., 2014; Dama- 
raju et al., 2014; Preti et al., 2017 ), hierarchical  clustering  ( Gotts et al., 
2020; Michel et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014 ), spectral  clustering  ( Dillon 
and Wang, 2020; Thirion  et al., 2006 ), fuzzy clustering  ( He and Green- 
shields,  2008; Seghier,  2018 ), temporal  clustering  ( Karahano  ğlu and 
van de Ville, 2015; Liu et al., 2000; Morgan  et al., 2008 ), and Gaussian  
mixture  models ( Roge et al., 2017; Schoenmakers  et al., 2014; 2015 ) 
have been particularly  popular  recently  in analyzing  both resting-state  
and task-based  functional  MRI data. A key challenge  in this approach  is 
to identify  the optimal  number  of clusters  for each individual  and group 
( Thirion  et al., 2014 ). 2.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5577, 5580), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(29896, 29898), match='3.'>"

sustained,  domain-general  brain mechanisms  responsible  for transfer  in 
speciﬁc  individuals  following  training  using these tasks may provide  a 
means of determining  how to enhance  transfer  eﬀects in the population  
as a whole. 
Recently  there has been a shift towards  understanding  neural func- 
tion in terms of brain topology  rather than analyzing  speciﬁc  regions  in 
isolation.  Research  has shown that an individual’s  brain topology  shows 
trait-like  properties  (i.e., is reliable  over time and individual-speciﬁc)  
( Finn et al., 2015 ; Gratton  et al., 2018 ), and relates robustly  to their 
cognitive  traits, including  in older adults at various  stages of cognitive  
decline  ( Avery et al., 2020 ). Brain topology  therefore  reﬂects  a key tar- 
get for the identiﬁcation  of long-lasting  brain mechanisms  that can be 
exploited  to improve  transfer  eﬀects of cognitive  training  in individu-  
als with aMCI. One potential  mechanism  involves  the capacity  of the 
cerebral  cortex for integrating  information  across a range of cognitive  
processes  via connections  that link functionally  specialized  networks.  
Recent research  suggests  this capacity  can be understood  by studying  
Participation  Coeﬃcient  (PC; how divese a brain region’s  connections  
are to diﬀerent  functionally  specialized  networks)  and that cortical  net- 
works containing  many high PC nodes are particularly  important  for 
supporting  the integration  of information  ( Bertolero  et al., 2017 ). Corti- 
cal networks  that include  many high PC nodes could facilitate  eﬀective  
transfer  of training  using PS/A tasks because  1) these networks  are ro- 
bustly activated  by PS/A tasks in aMCI ( Li et al., 2015 ), 2) high PC nodes 
in these networks  are critical for a wide range of cognitive  processes  
( Warren  et al., 2014 ), and 3) PC reﬂects  a property  of brain architec-  
ture with relatively  high test-retest  reliability,  suggesting  changes  may 
persist over time ( Du et al., 2015 ). Importantly,  preliminary  research  
suggests  that training  using PS/A tasks causes an increase  in functional  
connectivity  between  regions  within these networks  ( Ross et al., 2019 ) 
in healthy  older adults, suggesting  the potential  for improving  PC in 
these regions  via tasks involving  PS/A. 
Using a randomized  controlled  trial design, we examined  the un- 
derlying  brain mechanisms  of transfer  eﬀects by looking  at cortical  
network-level  PC in participants  with aMCI that completed  a 6-week  
VSOP (vision-based  speed of processing)  cognitive  training  that is vision- 
driven PS/A-oriented,  in comparison  to an active control group engaging  
in computerized  mental leisure activities  (MLA) of Sudoku,  cross-word  
puzzles,  and solitaire.  We collected  behavioral  data on trained  (Useful  
Field-of-View;  UFOV) and transferred  cognitive  domains  (working  mem- 
ory and episodic  memory),  as well as brain imaging  data on resting-state  
and a PS/A task related fMRI immedilatey  before and after 6-week  in- 
tervention.  We hypothesized  that transfer  to untrained  domains  in older 
adults with aMCI would relate to increased  network  PC in speciﬁc  net- 
works including  large numbers  of high PC nodes that are robustly  acti- 
vated by VSOP training.  By assessing  the interaction  of group-by-neural  
change,  we wanted  to assess whether  enhanced  network  PC in the inter- 
vention  group speciﬁcally  was related to increased  transfer  eﬀects. We 
expected  to see the eﬀects of network  PC particularly  in networks  with 
high PC nodes that are activated  by VSOP training,  such as ventral and 
dorsal attention,  and frontoparietal  networks  ( Bertolero  et al., 2017 ). 
We also tested whether  changes  of network  PC mediated  the relation-  
ship between  trained  and untrained  domains.  
Results  
By capitalizing  on a vision-driven  PS/A-oriented  6-week  intervention  
in 84 older adults with aMCI and applying  whole-brain  graph theoreti-  
cal methods  to functional  connectivity  data acquired  using resting state 
fMRI, we examined  the underlying  neural mechanisms  of transfer  eﬀects 
induced  by cognitive  training.  We randomly  assigned  participants  into 
VSOP intervention  and MLA control groups at a 2:1 ratio. Sample  char- 
acteristics  are in Table 1 . There were no signiﬁcant  group diﬀerences  
in baseline  characteristics.  To study the intervention  eﬀect, we only in- 
cluded participants  who had both baseline  assessment  and assessment  
immediately  after the intervention  period (VSOP:  n = 49; MLA: n = 28). For each individual  the T1 image was parcellated  into 3661 network  
nodes using FreeSurfer  and the SBCI pipeline  ( Cole et al., 2021 ) and then 
a 3661 by 3661 functional  connectivity  matrix was generated  for base- 
line and post-intervention  respectively.  Fig. 1 A left shows an example  
of the mean functional  connectivity  matrix for the whole group at base- 
line. We assigned  each node to one of the seven large-scale  functional  
networks  deﬁned  by Yeo et al. (2011) ( Fig. 1 A right). To assess the spar- 
sity of the functional  networks,  we calculated  the density  as the ratio of 
the number  of positive  fc edges with respect to the maximum  possible  
edges for each participant  at baseline.  Then we averaged  density  across 
all participants  to obtain the group mean density.  The group mean den- 
sity is 49% for the whole brain, 42% - 62% for between-networks,  and 
63% - 80% for within-networks  ( Supplemental  Figure 1 ). Using these 
pre-deﬁned  networks,  we calculated  PC: nodes with functional  connec-  
tivity to only nodes from their own network  have a PC of 0, while nodes 
with many distributed  between-network  connections  would have a PC 
closer to 1. We measured  network  PC by calculating  mean PC across 
all nodes within a network  and similarly  averaged  across all nodes for 
global analyses  (see Fig. 1 B for a schematic  depiction)  . We hypothe-  
sized that transfer  eﬀects would relate to increased  PC across large-scale  
brain networks  after training,  particularly  in networks  with more high- 
PC nodes (e.g., network  C in Fig. 1 B ). 
Training  eﬀect on trained and untrained  cognitive  domains  
To test whether  VSOP training  resulted  in improvements  in trained  
(UFOV)  and untrained  domains  (working  memory  and episodic  mem- 
ory), we calculated  the group diﬀerence  in reliable  improvements,  
where a participant  was classiﬁed  as having improved  reliably  if their 
performance  at a follow-up  occasion  exceeded  baseline  performance  by 
1 SEM of baseline  data (cf., ACTIVE  trial ( Ball et al., 2002 )) ( Fig. 2 , 
see Method  section  for details  ). Signiﬁcant  between-group  diﬀerences  
that were higher in the VSOP group relative  to MLA included:  UFOV 
from baseline  to post-test  ( g = 0.51, 𝜒2 = 7.07, p = 0.008),  working  mem-

adjusting  the position  of shimming  pieces, non-suitable  for clinical  prac- 
tice. Passive  shim developments  have come to a halt in the early 2010’s,  
coinciding  with the advances  of Multi-Coil  Arrays (MCA) located  close 
to the subject’s  head in order to minimize  the currents  required  for shim- 
ming ( Juchem  et al., 2011; 2010; Stockmann  et al., 2021; Truong  et al., 
2014 ). 
Unlike SH-correcting  systems,  MCA prototypes  allow the addi- 
tion of several coils on a single layer, without  a priori considera-  
tion for SH compensation.  Yet the MCA matrix arrangement  proposed  
by Juchem  et al. (2013) was shown to be capable  of modeling  SH 
ﬁeld shapes to good accuracy  ; its beneﬁts  on EPI and spectroscopy  
were explored  in Juchem  et al. (2015) , Juchem  and Graaf (2017) , 
where 48-channel  DYNAMITE  shimming  was shown to outperform  
5th order in whole-brain  static SH shimming  (and 4th order in dy- 
namic slice-by-slice  shimming).  An alternative  MCA approach  was pro- 
posed in the works of Stockmann  et al. (2013) , Han et al. (2013) , 
Truong  et al. (2014) , Stockmann  et al. (2016) , whereby  the RF receive  
loops were adapted  to run DC currents,  boosting  the capabilities  of con- 
ventional  RF arrays into the generation  of B 0 shim ﬁelds, with minor 
degradation  in SNR. This approach  is rather economical  in terms of 
space, only requiring  inductive  chokes to connect  the RF receive  loops 
to the DC current  driver while isolating  the current  driver from the RF 
signal. 
The low-cost  MCA approach  has continued  to be developed  in recent 
works Aghaeifar  et al. (2018) , Zhou et al. (2020) , Esmaeili  et al. (2020) , 
and has also become  available  as a commercial  solution  provided  by 
MR Shim, GmbH. Yet until recently,  MCA implementations  have been 
built either by regularly  distributing  circular  coils around some cylin- 
drical former (matrix-like),  or took advantage  of pre-existing  RF loops. 
No optimization  of both the coils’ positions  and geometry  has been per- 
formed.  Yet While and Korvink  (2014) were ﬁrst to propose  to optimize  
the geometry  of the coil loops for multi-coil  shim arrays, albeit at ﬁxed 
positions,  following  a stream-function-based  optimisation  approach  in- 
volving  minimised  power dissipation.  
With the perspective  of brain imaging  at 11.7 T with the Iseult 
MRI scanner  ( Quettier  et al., 2020 ), pushing  the limits of MCA shim- 
ming capabilities  is required,  as B 0 inhomogeneity  will be stronger  
than ever. We therefore  developed  an original  MCA design methodol-  
ogy ( Pinho Meneses  and Amadon,  2020b ) for judicious  placement  and 
geometry  of each 𝛿𝐵 0 -compensating  coil to improve  performance  for 
whole-brain  shimming,  based on Stream-Functions  Singular  Value De- 
composition  (SF-SVD).  
The SF-SVD  method  was simultaneously  introduced  by three re- 
search teams at the 2019 ISMRM  conference  ( Arango  et al., 2019; Jia 
et al., 2019; Meneses  and Amadon,  2019a; 2019b ), and later detailed  
by Jia et al. (2020) and ourselves  ( Pinho Meneses  and Amadon,  2021 ). 
It starts from a large database  of brain 𝛿𝐵 0 ﬁeldmaps.  For each brain, a 
stream function  (SF) is computed  on a cylindrical  geometry  surround-  
ing it, characterizing  ideal current  lines to perform  optimal  shimming  
for that brain. Then a Principal  Component  Analysis  (or SVD) is car- 
ried out on these optimized  SF’s to extract common  features  and de- 
rive a set of coils addressing  them. A formal reminder  of the proce- 
dure is quickly  recalled  in Methods.  Here we combine  this prior work 
with the concept  of multi-coil  arrays, by discretizing  the SF-SVD  modes 
into independently-driven  loops or coils. We ﬁrst introduced  the MCA 
based on SF-SVD  at the same ISMRM-2019  conference  ( Meneses  et al., 
2019 ), and later presented  13-channel  ( Pinho Meneses  et al., 2020 ) and 
36-channel  ( Pinho Meneses  et al., 2021 ) prototypes  at the following  
ISMRM  conferences,  where in-vivo preliminary  results were acquired  
at 7T from a simple Tx/Rx RF loop coil placed on the subject’s  forehead  
( Pinho Meneses  et al., 2021 ). Here a 48-channel  shim prototype  was 
built and evaluated  in-vivo at 7T with a parallel  transmit  coil designed  
for insertion  in the shim setup. 
In the meantime,  Aghaeifar  et al. also worked  on the optimization  
of MCA coil position  and size, but their work has been limited to rect- 
angular  coil geometries  ( Aghaeifar  et al., 2020 ). Interest  in MCA op- timization  is rising, with novel methodologies  presented  recently  in 
Arango  et al. (2020) , Oh et al. (2020) , Cai et al. (2020) . 
2. Methods  
To design an MCA adapted  to the inhomogeneous  ﬁeld patterns  
encountered  in the human brain, a semi-heuristic  approach  was em- 
ployed for optimization  of channels’  geometry  and position.  It is based 
on the principal  components  of a database  of Subject-Optimal  Stream-  
Functions  (SO-SFs),  which provide  indications  of where electric  current  
is most demanded  for B 0 shimming  of the human brain. 
The following  steps were performed  for design and validation  of the 
optimized  MCA: (1) a 100-subject  database  of 𝛿𝐵 0 brain ﬁeldmaps  was 
acquired,  covering  all kinds of human head morphometries;  (2) cylin- 
drical SO-SFs were computed  for each subject in the database,  and SVD 
was performed  on the SO-SF set; (3) from the ﬁrst SF-SVD  modes, in- 
dication  of where electric  current  is most demanded  for human brain 
shimming  was obtained;  then an MCA was designed  based on this in- 
dication;  (4) shimming  simulations  with the obtained  design were per- 
formed  on the in-house  database  (IHD) and on an external  open-access  
database  (OAD) for performance  assessment  and validation;  (5) a proto- 
type was built, characterized  and tested in-vivo . These steps are detailed  
next. 
2.1. Computation  of subject-optimal  stream function  and stream function  
SVD modes on a coil former 
Given 𝑆subjects,  𝒃 𝑠 = [𝛿𝐵 𝑠 
0 ( 𝒙 1 ) 𝛿𝐵 𝑠 
0 ( 𝒙 2 ) … 𝛿𝐵 𝑠 
0 ( 𝒙 𝐾 𝑠 ) ]𝑇 ∈
ℝ 𝐾 𝑠 , for 𝑠 = 1 , …, 𝑆, is the target ﬁeldmap  to be compensated  for in 
the human brain for a subject 𝑠 containing  𝐾 𝑠 voxels located  at coordi- 
nates 𝒙 𝑘 ∈ℝ 3 , with 𝑘 = 1 , …, 𝐾 𝑠 . For designing  a shim coil, a cylindrical  
surface  ∈ℝ 3 , of radius 𝑎 and length 𝐿 , used as coil former,  exterior  
to the target region, is also deﬁned.  Employing  the Dipole Boundary  
Method  (DBM) ( Pinho Meneses  and Amadon,  2021 ), is discretized  into 
𝑁square elements  upon which an optimal  stream function  𝝍 𝒔 ∈ℝ 𝑁 
can be computed,  associated  to the current  ﬂow required  to mitigate  
inhomogeneity  under power constraints.  While we limit ourselves  to a 
simple cylindrical  geometry,  well suited for DBM square elements,  other 
coil former geometries  can be envisioned,  in which case it may be nec- 
essary to use other stream function  calculation  methods  ( Bringout  and 
Buzug, 2015; Pissanetzky,  1992; Poole and Bowtell,  2007 ). 
The SO-SFs are then assembled  in a matrix 𝚿DB = [
𝝍 1 𝝍 2 … 𝝍 𝑆 ]∈ℝ 𝑁×𝑆 upon which an SVD can be applied  
to obtain a new matrix 𝚿SVD = [𝝍 SVD 
1 𝝍 SVD 
2 … 𝝍 SVD 
𝑆 ]∈ℝ 𝑁×𝑆 
whose columns  are principal  orthogonal  modes that can be linearly  
combined  to reconstruct  each of the SO-SFs.  A detailed  explanation  of 
the steps presented  so far is available  in Jia et al. (2020) , Pinho Mene- 
ses and Amadon  (2021) , but the design is nevertheless  complex  and 
non-trivial  to be translated  into an actual coil, as all iso-current  lines 
(example  in Fig. 1 a) need to be carefully  connected  in series. 
2.2. Selection  of MCA windings  
The SF-SVD  coils computed  in the previous  step then serve to deﬁne 
the position  and shape of independent  windings  to be used in a brain- 
optimized  Multi-Coil  Array. Since the SF-SVD  modes in 𝚿SVD are ordered  
by degree of correlation  with the stream functions  in 𝚿DB , with the ﬁrst 
mode (ﬁrst column)  being the most correlated  and the last mode (last 
column)  the least correlated,  we expect that the decomposition  of the 
ﬁrst few modes into MCAs will provide  the most important  components  
for human brain shimming.  
Assuming  the 𝑀ﬁrst SF-SVD  modes are selected,  each SF-SVD  mode 
is discretized  into windings  based on a minimum  inter-wire  spacing  𝛿𝑤 , 
and a family  𝑚 
SVD of closed curves describing  the wirepaths  obtained  
from the discretization  is obtained  for each mode 𝑚 . From the wirepath  
conﬁguration  of the SF-SVD  mode in Fig. 1 a, the presence  of clusters

overlaid;  (b) the same laid-out on a plane for easier visualization  of the stream function’s  extrema  and wire paths cluster formation  around them; (c) the selection  of 
12 loops from the symmetrized  SF-SVD mode according  to the proposed  criteria; (d) coils’ geometry  and position  around the human head; an accumulation  of coils

of current  is distinct.  The clusters  mark where electric  current  is most 
demanded  for inhomogeneity  mitigation.  Taking into account  the cur- 
rent requirements  around the cylindrical  surface,  independently-driven  
windings  with shapes analogous  to the clusters  can be positioned  on the 
surface to form an MCA. 
Our task now is to select, for each mode, the most suitable  loops to 
generate  the MCA. From Fig. 1 b, the clusters  of wirepath  (or current)  
are associated  with the extrema  of the stream function,  with current  
revolving  around them: indeed the current  density  computed  from a 
stream function  is 𝒋 ( 𝒙 ) = ∇ 𝜓( 𝒙 ) ×̂𝒏 ( 𝒙 ) , therefore,  the more intense  the 
local extremum,  the greater the electric  current  density  will ﬂow around 
it. Based on this principle,  a winding  selection  criterion  was devised,  
where each winding  corresponds  to an independent  current  channel.  
Physically,  windings  selected  from each mode will be placed on cylin- 
drical layers of increasing  radii. If, when selecting  a mode 𝑚 for discretization,  we observe  some de- 
gree of symmetry,  which can arise naturally  given that these stream 
functions  target the human brain, we eﬀectively  force symmetry  on the 
SF by making  
𝜓 sym 
𝑚 = 𝜓 𝑚 (− 𝜙, 𝑧 ) + 𝜓 𝑚 ( 𝜙, 𝑧 ) 
2 . (1) 
Let 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ∈be the coordinates  of the extrema  of 𝜓 𝑚 ( 𝒙 ) (i.e. of local 
maxima  or minima  in the ( 𝜙, 𝑧 ) plane), with 𝑝 = 1 , …, 𝐸 𝑚 and 𝐸 𝑚 the to- 
tal number  of extrema  of 𝜓 𝑚 . For each extremum,  a subset of wirepaths  
( 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ) ⊂ 𝑚 
SVD that enclose  only 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 among the extrema  coordinates  can 
be constructed.  For each subset ( 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ) , the cardinality  # ( 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ) (i.e. the 
number  of wirepaths  around the 𝑝 extremum  only) indicates  its level 
of signiﬁcance  for shimming,  as it is directly  related to the amount  of 
current  ﬂowing  around the extremum.  Finally,  for those subsets with 
3  B. Pinho Meneses, J.P. Stockmann,  N. Arango et al. NeuroImage  261 (2022) 119498 
higher cardinality,  we choose the largest loop 𝑐 ∈( 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ) to become  an in- 
dependent  winding  approximating  the current  requirement  around that 
extremum.  The particular  choice of the largest loop is helpful to re- 
duce electric  current  demand  for generating  some peak magnetic  ﬁeld 
strength  in a ROI. 
Having  laid-out  the required  entities  for channel  deﬁnition,  a num- 
ber of desired  loops/windings/coils  𝑁 ch for the MCA is chosen.  Limi- 
tations of the number  of amplifying  channels  supported  by the driving  
electronics  must be taken into account.  Therefore,  selecting  loops with 
low inﬂuence  on the overall magnetic  ﬁeld should be avoided;  this is 
why a minimum  cardinality  threshold  𝜏card and/or a maximum  num- 
ber of channels  per SF-SVD  mode 𝑁 𝑚 are advisable,  allowing  the loop 
selection  to move to more relevant  geometries  in the subsequent  SF- 
SVD modes without  having to select all potential  but eventually  worse- 
performing  coils from each mode. 
For mode 𝑚 , the ﬁrst channel  selected  is the largest loop from the 
subset of greatest  cardinality  among all subsets ( 𝒙 𝑚 
𝑝 ) associated  to the 
mode. This subset is then ignored,  and the next channel  is deﬁned  as 
the largest loop extracted  from the subset of greatest  cardinality  among 
the remaining  subsets.  This process  is repeated  until either the cardinal-  
ity threshold  𝜏card , the maximum  number  of channels  per mode 𝑁 𝑚 , or 
the total number  of channels  𝑁 ch is reached.  Once all channels  within 
the established  criteria  are obtained  from mode 𝑚 , we move to the next 
mode, 𝑚 + 1 , and the selection  procedure  is repeated.  The channel  def- 
inition process  must start at 𝑚 = 1 . Due to space limitations,  a maxi- 
mum number  of modes 𝑀is also imposed  to limit the number  of lay- 
ers and the overall thickness  of the shim system.  At the end of this 
process,  the channels  of the MCA are described  by the set of closed 
loops  = { 𝑤 1 , 𝑤 2 , …, 𝑤 𝑁 ch } . An illustration  of a few loops selected  
with 𝜏card = 3 from a symmetrized  SF-SVD  mode is shown in Fig. 1 c–
d. 
This ‘decomposition’  process  of SF-SVD  coils into multiple  indepen-  
dent coils is advantageous  due to the multi-channel  capacity  of better 
addressing  asymmetries  in ﬁeld distribution  inside the brain. When an 
SF-SVD  coil, driven by a single current  through  all the wirings,  is trans- 
formed  into an MCA, the degrees  of freedom  of the system increase,  pro- 
viding better adaptation  to anatomy  variations.  In particular,  whereas  
the symmetrized  SF-SVD  coil only addresses  carefully-positioned  heads 
along the (y,z) vertical  plane, the MCA ﬂexibility  is expected  to help 
correcting  for small rotations  of the subject’s  head to the left or right. 
Construction  of the system is also simpler  than forcing a single input 
current  through  all wires. Some complex  wiring patterns  present  in the 
SF-SVD  can be discarded  with practically  no loss of performance,  as ob- 
served in preliminary  simulations  (not reported  here). 
Notice that the windings  deﬁned  so far were all considered  to be 
over the same cylindrical  surface.  Although  channel-loops  from the same 
mode do not overlap,  those from distinct  modes may certainly  do so, 
which could make the system deﬁned  so far impractical.  The second,  
third and further modes must be projected  onto cylindrical  surfaces  of 
higher radii, but the deﬁnition  of these radii will depend  on construc-  
tion aspects.  Each channel  is described  so far by a single loop, but the 
real system will consist of multiple  turns for each channel-winding  to 
allow the generation  of higher ﬁelds with relatively  low currents.  Given 
a winding  wire diameter,  this will imply a radial wire bundle thickness,  
which will impose minimum  radii of the subsequent  channel  layers. 
To start deﬁning  building  aspects  of the system,  an initial Single Loop 
Model (SLM) must be simulated.

threshold  ( Woo et al., 2014 ), or the diﬃculty  to establish  a null dis- 
tribution  for cluster size and aggregated  signal. To address  this last 
issue, reliable  non-parametric  solutions  have been proposed  ( Eklund 
et al., 2016; Winkler  et al., 2014 ). However,  the arbitrariness  regard-  
ing cluster-forming  threshold  is hard to deal with. To overcome  it, one 
may deﬁne such clusters  or regions,  and then assess the proportion  of 
active voxels in each region, i.e the True Discovery  Proportion,  TDP = 
1 - FDP. Such a region of interest  could be deﬁned  a priori, using an 
anatomical  atlas, or a posteriori,  based on the fMRI data. For instance,  
one might wonder  what is the proportion  of active regions  in a blob , 
i.e. a contiguous  set of statistical  values that are higher than the image 
background.  Yet, such a deﬁnition  of the clusters  after seeing the data 
raises a double-dipping  issue, which can lead to massive  false positive  
inﬂation  ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2009 ). 
To illustrate  this statistical  bias, let us consider  a classical  example  
of invalid post-selection  inference.  Users often perform  a ﬁrst round of 
tests to identify  potentially  interesting  regions  (i.e., regions  comprising  
signiﬁcant  signal).  If inference  is performed  only on smallest  𝑝 -values 
obtained  at this ﬁrst round, then the FDP is not controlled,  as shown 
in Blanchard  et al. (2020) . To bypass this double-dipping  issue, one can 
use post hoc estimates  that control the FDP. Note that an upper bound on 
the FDP is equivalent  to a lower bound on the TDP. The ﬁrst method  of 
that kind is a parametric  method  called All-resolutions  inference  (ARI) 
( Rosenblatt  et al., 2018 ). 
In this paper, we introduce  the Notip procedure,  that adapts non- 
parametrically  to data correlation.  The use of non-parametric  proce- 
dures also renders  the inference  robust to mis-speciﬁcation  of the statis- 
tics distribution.  We study whether  such a procedure  can yield less con- 
servative  inference  while oﬀering  the same statistical  guarantees.  We 
perform  extensive  experiments  on dozens of fMRI datasets  to compare  
the number  of detections  obtained  by this approach  with that of existing  
methods.  
The paper is organized  as follows.  In Section  2 , existing  methods  for 
the post hoc control of FDP are introduced  via the notion of Joint Error 
Rate (JER) proposed  by Blanchard  et al. (2020) . Our main contribution  
is the Notip method  presented  in Section  3 : a nonparametric  data-driven  
approach  that relies on the JER framework  to obtain sharper  post hoc 
FDP control.  Numerical  experiments  and results on fMRI data reported  
in Sections  4 and 5 show that substantial  gains in the number  of detec- 
tions are obtained  from the proposed  method,  while controlling  the FDP 
of the detected  regions  at a ﬁxed level. Finally,  we discuss the beneﬁts  
of our proposed  methodology,  and outline some possible  limitations.  
2. False discovery  proportion  control  by joint error rate control  
The point of this article is to build an inference  method  that takes into 
account  multiplicity  and circularity  by achieving  post hoc FDP control,  
while maintaining  satisfactory  statistical  power. 
2.1. Notation  
We denote by 𝑚 the number  of hypotheses,  i.e. the number  of vox- 
els under consideration  (typically  spanning  a given brain template).  In 
the context  of fMRI, 𝑚 generally  ranges from 50,000 to 400,000.  We 
denote the set of true null hypotheses  (voxels with no eﬀect) by 𝐻 0 , 
and by 𝑚 0 = |𝐻 0 |its cardinal.  Given a set of 𝑚 𝑝 -values associated  to 
each hypothesis,  we denote by 𝑝 ( 𝑘 ∶ 𝑚 ) the 𝑘 th one in ascending  order. 
For a set 𝑆of hypotheses  of interest  (i.e. the set of voxels in a region 
of interest),  the aim is to control the number  of false positives  in 𝑆, 
that is ||𝑆 ∩𝐻 0 ||, or equivalently,  the corresponding  proportion  of false 
positives:  FDP ( 𝑆) = ||𝑆 ∩𝐻 0 ||∕ |𝑆 |. 
2.2. Post hoc FDP control 
The most common  approach  to address  large-scale  multiplicity  prob- 
lems is to control the False Discovery  Rate (FDR) ( Benjamini  and Hochberg,  1995 ). This is generally  done by the Benjamini-Hochberg  
(BH) procedure  ( Benjamini  and Hochberg,  1995 ), which uses diﬀerent  
signiﬁcance  thresholds  depending  on the ranks of the 𝑝 -values:  the 𝑘 th 
𝑝 -value is compared  to 𝑡 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 
𝑘 = 𝛼𝑘 ∕ 𝑚 . The BH procedure  controls  the 
FDR under the PRDS (Positive  Regression  Dependency  on a Subset)  as- 
sumption  ( Benjamini  and Yekutieli,  2001 ). However,  since the FDR is 
the expected  FDP, FDR control is a weak statistical  guarantee  on the 
actual FDP ( Korn et al., 2004 ). This can be problematic  when the FDP 
distribution  has heavy tails, which can happen  when the tested hypothe-  
ses are dependent.  In such cases, the FDR might be controlled  while FDP 
quantiles  diverge  (see Figure 2.1 in Neuvial  (2020) ). We thus choose to 
focus on the control of the actual number  (or proportion)  of false posi- 
tives. 
A post hoc upper bound 𝑉 on the number  of false positives  is an 
integer-valued  function  of subsets 𝑆of hypotheses  that satisﬁes:  
ℙ (∀𝑆 , ||𝑆 ∩𝐻 0 ||≤ 𝑉 ( 𝑆 ) )≥ 1 − 𝛼. (1) 
Since FDP ( 𝑆) = ||𝑆 ∩𝐻 0 ||∕ |𝑆 |, obtaining  a bound 𝑉 satisfying  (1) is 
strictly equivalent  to obtaining  a post hoc upper bound on the FDP. 
This equivalence  will be used implicitly  throughout  the paper. 
As described  in Goeman  and Solari (2011) , the comparison  between  
ordered  𝑝 -values and (𝑡 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 
𝑘 )
𝑘 =1 .𝑚 can also provide  post hoc FDP control.  
This can be done using closed testing ( Marcus  et al., 1976 ) combined  
with the following  inequality:  
ℙ (
∃𝑘 ∈{1 , …, 𝑚 0 }∶ 𝑝 ( 𝑘 ∶ 𝑚 0 ) < 𝑡 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 
𝑘 )
≤ 𝛼. (2) 
Eq. (2) is an immediate  consequence  of the Simes inequality  
( Simes, 1986 ), and also holds under the PRDS assumption.  The All- 
resolutions  inference  (ARI) method  ( Rosenblatt  et al., 2018 ) pro- 
vides a tighter post hoc bound that uses the thresholds  𝛼𝑘 ∕ ℎ ( 𝛼) in- 
stead of 𝑡 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 
𝑘 = 𝛼𝑘 ∕ 𝑚 in (2) , where ℎ ( 𝛼) ≤ 𝑚 is the so-called  Hommel  
value ( Hommel,  1986 ). ℎ ( 𝛼) represents  an 1 − 𝛼-level upper conﬁdence  
bound on the number  𝑚 0 of true null hypotheses.

The R and STAN code used to apply this method  are provided  in 
an open repository  ( https://github.com/mathesong/SiMBA  _ Materials  ), 
including  a sample simulated  dataset.  The measured  data used in the 
application  section is drawn from previous  studies ( Chen et al., 2019 ). 
4. Simulations  
For the purpose  of assessing  the measurement  properties  of this ap- 
proach,  we generated  simulated  datasets  to compare  the performance  
of the proposed  methodology  to that of the conventional  approach.  
Data were simulated  in order to resemble  the true PET data de- 
scribed  in the next section,  using the [ 11 C]WAY100635  radiotracer.  We 
extracted  the posterior  mean values for all estimated  population  param- 
eters and used these as the “ground  truth ”to generate  realistic  param- 
eter values. For variation  across individuals  and TACs (i.e. Region ×
Individuals),  we sampled  individual  new parameter  values from the uni- 
variate and multivariate  normal  distributions,  while for variation  across 
regions,  we made use of the posterior  mean values. In this way, we sim- 
ulate from the same set of regions,  but in a new set of individuals,  with 
a new set of individual  variations  at the regional  level. The simulation  
parameters  are described  in Supplementary  Materials  S2. 
TACs were simulated  using the two-tissue  compartment  model us- 
ing these parameter  values, with blood data randomly  sampled  from 
individuals  (with replacement)  from the measured  data. Measurement  
error was added to the simulated  curves using a normal  distribution  with 
mean 0, and the standard  deviation  determined  in a similar manner  as 
for the pharmacokinetic  parameters,  i.e. using the posterior  means for 
regional  diﬀerences,  but sampling  individual  diﬀerences  from the uni- 
variate normal  distribution.  As before, this has the eﬀect of simulating  
data from the same set of regions,  but in a new set of individuals.  To 
this, we added the global mean value of the SD of the measurement  er- 
ror, for which we used 10% of the mean TAC value. Rather than using 
the value estimated  from the data, we opted to select a value which 
facilitates  comparison  with other data sets, and which more closely re- 
sembles  a worst-case  scenario.  This value is approximately  double that 
estimated  from the measured  PET data. Finally,  we also added the poste- 
rior mean value of the smooth  function  for each time point within each 
TAC. 
In order to evaluate  the sensitivity  and speciﬁcity  of the approach,  
we tested for group diﬀerences.  To evaluate  power, we simulated  two 
groups,  with a true global (i.e., across all 9 regions)  group diﬀerence  of 
20% in 𝐵𝑃 ND (i.e., Δlog( 𝐵𝑃 ND ) = 0.182).  
Based on the mean posterior  standard  deviation  of 𝐵𝑃 ND across in- 
dividuals  in the sample,  this corresponds  with a moderate  eﬀect size 
(Cohen’s  d = 0.55). 
To evaluate  the potential  for false positives,  we also tested for group 
diﬀerences  in simulated  data sets for which there were no diﬀerences.  
No additional  covariates,  such as age or sex, were included,  other 
than that of group membership.  
We simulated  datasets  with group sizes of multiples  of 10 between  10 
and 100 (i.e., for a group size of 20, there are 20 controls  and 20 patients,  
and therefore  40 individuals  included  in the study). For the NLS models,  
we generated  1000 simulated  studies for each condition,  i.e. for groups 
of 50, this results in a number  of TACs of 1000 ×2 conditions  (group 
diﬀerences  vs no group diﬀerences)  ×50 individuals  ×2 groups ×9 
regions.  For the estimation  of NLS parameters,  each TAC was ﬁtted 10 
times with randomly  sampled  starting  parameters  and the best ﬁt was 
selected  using the nls.multstart  package  ( Padﬁeld  and Matheson,  2018 ), 
to ensure that ﬁts were optimal.  In all cases, outcome  parameters  were 
calculated  directly  using the rate constants,  and not indirectly  using a reference  tissue, i.e. 𝐵𝑃 ND = 𝑘 3 
𝑘 4 . It should be noted that the calculation  
of 𝐵𝑃 ND in this manner  is not a recommended  practice  using NLS, as it 
is known to be prone to error ( Parsey et al., 2000; Slifstein  and Laruelle,  
2001 ). However,  as we show below, direct estimation  of 𝐵𝑃 P is more 
accurate,  and can be considered  a better index of potential  performance  
of NLS rather than 𝐵𝑃 ND . 
For SiMBA,  ﬁtting the model to so many datasets  would have in- 
curred a very large computational  burden owing to the greater compu-  
tational  requirements.  Instead,  we limited sample sizes to group sizes of 
10, 20 and 50, and generated  only 50 simulated  studies for each con- 
dition. Applying  the model to these datasets  resulted  in approximately  
1.5 core years of processing.  
4.1. Comparison  of power for detecting  group diﬀerences  
Using the simulated  data described  above, we performed  inference  
on group diﬀerences  to determine  the power or sensitivity,  i.e., true 
positives,  and speciﬁcity,  i.e., false positives,  of the model. 
For inference  for the NLS results,  we performed  both t-tests and 
linear mixed eﬀects (LME) modelled  using the generated  outcome  pa- 
rameters  after being transformed  to their natural  logarithms.  Welch’s  
t-tests were ﬁt for each region separately,  while the LME model was 
applied  across all regions,  with ﬁxed eﬀects for region and for group 
membership,  and a random  intercept  for individuals.  These are both 
common  strategies  employed  in clinical  PET studies,  which are used 
as a basis for comparison.  Although  for global diﬀerences  the LME 
model is obviously  more appropriate,  t-tests are often employed  in PET 
studies,  even when diﬀerences  are global: our intent was not to com- 
pare these two approaches  with one another,  but to provide  an ap- 
propriate  baseline  comparison  for the SiMBA model. P-values  for the 
LME were calculated  using the lmerTest  package  ( Kuznetsova  et al., 
2017 ). 
For the hierarchical  Bayesian  model, binary inferences  were deter- 
mined by assessing  whether  the 95% credible  interval  of the posterior  
estimate  of the group diﬀerence  included  or excluded  zero. Due to the 
small sample size, we ﬁt logspline  density  functions  ( Stone et al., 1997 ) 
to both the upper and lower bounds  of the 95% credible  intervals  across 
simulations,  and estimated  the proportion  of the distributions  for which 
the estimates  would not include  zero using their cumulative  density  
functions.  The logspline  ﬁts were visually  assessed,  and estimates  were 
closely aligned  with the empirical  estimates  (Supplementary  Materials  
S3). For this reason,  we have included  95% conﬁdence  intervals  around 
the estimated  power for SiMBA.  Furthermore,  in order to conﬁrm  that 
the diﬀerent  simulated  datasets  did not induce any bias, we also per- 
formed  all NLS analyses  using the same data to which SiMBA was ap- 
plied, using both empirical  and logspline  estimation,  which produced  
very similar results (Supplementary  Materials  S4). We calculated  95% 
conﬁdence  intervals  for the power using bootstrap  resampling,  i.e., by 
repeating  the logspline  procedure  for 1000 samples  of the 50 outcomes  
sampled  with replacement.  
As shown in Fig. 3 , we show that the LME model exhibits  greater 
power compared  to regional  t-tests as expected,  and we show that the 
SiMBA model exhibits  substantially  increased  power relative  to both of 
these methods.  This suggests  that SiMBA demonstrates  greater sensitiv-  
ity to detect true diﬀerences  between  groups for the same sample size, 
exhibiting  power equivalent  to sample sizes of approximately  double 
using NLS estimation  and LME. We also show that no models exhibit 
a false positive  rate that is signiﬁcantly  or substantially  diﬀer from 5% 
( Fig. 4 ). Taken together,  this suggests  that SiMBA is more sensitive  than 
the traditional  NLS methods,  without  sacriﬁcing  speciﬁcity  
Although  LME applied  to 𝐵𝑃 ND shows poor performance  in Fig. 3 , 
likely owing to poor estimation,  LME applied  to 𝐵𝑃 P exhibits  similar or 
only marginally  reduced  power compared  to when LME is applied  to the 
true values. This supports  direct estimation  of BP P as a good index of 
speciﬁc  binding  using NLS.

ulation and math (D) for CIFTI- and GIFTI-format  data. 
gramming  language  ( Stan Development  Team, 2021b ), Bayesian  hierar- 
chical models ( Plummer,  2003 ), integrated  nested Laplace  approxima-  
tion (INLA) for fast and accurate  posterior  estimation  ( Rue et al., 2009 ), 
spatial process  priors suitable  for surface-based  modeling  ( Lindgren  and 
Rue, 2015 ), and excursion  set approaches  useful for performing  joint 
inference  across the cortex to leverage  spatial information  ( Bolin and 
Lindgren,  2016 ). However,  the ability to use these advanced  statistical  
methods  is currently  limited by a lack of tools available  for working  with 
CIFTI-format  and other surface-based  neuroimaging  data in R. 
Here, we present  the ciftiTools  R package,  which provides  a 
user-friendly,  high-level  interface  for accessing  and analyzing  CIFTI 
and GIFTI data. Speciﬁcally,  ciftiTools  is a suite of tools for read- 
ing, writing,  visualizing,  processing,  and manipulating  CIFTI data and 
compatible  surface geometries  ( Fig. 1 ). It supports  three CIFTI intents 
or ﬁle types: “dtseries  ”( f o r timeseries  data), “dscalar  ”( f o r structural,  
continuously-valued  data), and “dlabel  ”(for parcellations,  labels, or cat- 
egorical  data). It also supports  GIFTI metric data (analogous  to “dtseries  ”
or “dscalar  ”) and label data (analogous  to “dlabel  ”) for wider applica-  
bility to surface-based  analysis.  We introduce  the object class ""xifti""  , 
which refers to the combination  of metric or label data (traditionally  
encoded  in CIFTI ﬁles or GIFTI metric or label ﬁles) with surface ge- 
ometries  encoded  in GIFTI surface geometry  ﬁles. This facilitates  the 
visualization,  processing,  and analysis  of surface data, since the data 
and its geometric  organization  are contained  within a single object. Be- 
low, we describe  the structure  and functionality  of the ciftiTools  
package  ( Section  2 ) and demonstrate  its use in an example  seed corre- 
lation analysis  ( Section  3 ). We also explain  its relationship  with other 
packages  and applications  ( Section  4 , summarized  in Table 1 ) to illus- 
trate that ciftiTools  uniquely  provides  uniﬁed support  for reading,  
writing,  plotting,  and manipulating  CIFTI-format  data. 
2. Overview  of ciftiTools  structure  and functionality  
Figure 1 illustrates  the general  use case for ciftiTools  . A ""xifti""  
object can be constructed  from either a CIFTI ﬁle or a combination  of GIFTI metric or label ﬁles and a NIFTI ﬁle. In either case, two GIFTI 
surface geometry  ﬁles may also be included  (Panel A). The ""xifti""  
can subsequently  be visualized  (Panel B), processed  and manipulated  
(Panels  C and D), and written  back to a ﬁle(s) (Panel A). The integra-  
tion of surface geometry  is convenient  because  surfaces  are required  
for visualizing  and smoothing  the cortical  data, since no cortical  spatial 
information  is included  in CIFTI ﬁles. Subcortical  voxel locations  and 
brain structure  labels, in contrast,  are contained  in the CIFTI XML. 
In this section,  we ﬁrst describe  the structure  of the ""xifti""  object 
class, and then describe  the functionality  illustrated  in each panel of 
Fig. 1 in greater detail. For the sake of brevity we will not catalog  every 
function  belonging  to each panel, nor will we cover the functions  which 
do not ﬁt into any of the four panels. However,  an organized  list of 
the most commonly  used functions  can be accessed  in Appendix  A and 
is reproduced  in R with the command  help(ciftiTools)  . A com- 
plete, alphabetical  list of all ciftiTools  functions  can be accessed  
with the command  help(package  = ""ciftiTools"")  . For each func- 
tion, more information  can be accessed  at its help page using the com- 
mand help(function_name)  , e.g. help(read_xifti)  . 
2.1. The “xifti ”object  class 
Figure 2 illustrates  the structure  of the ""xifti""  object class. It is 
organized  as a nested list with three entries at the ﬁrst level: data , the 
data matrices  for each brain structure;  surf , the left and right cortical  
surface geometries;  and meta , the various  metadata  including  medial 
wall masks (see Appendix  B for information  about the medial wall), 
subcortical  labels and mask, and CIFTI intent-speciﬁc  information.  If 
any entry is not present  in the ""xifti""  it will have a value of NULL . 
Since a ""xifti""  is a list, its contents  can be parsed with $ . For example,  
xii$meta$cifti$intent  returns the CIFTI intent of the ""xifti""  ob- 
ject xii . 
The left and right cortical  surface geometries  are themselves  objects 
of class ""surf""  . A ""surf""  object is a list with three entries:  vertices  , 
faces , and hemisphere  . A ""surf""  object can also exist separately

Table 1 
Summary  of comparison  between  programmatic  tools for CIFTI and GIFTI ﬁles. Checkmarks  are assigned  if the 
tool (rows) directly enables a user to complete  the task (columns).  A “3 ”for CIFTI functionalities  in ciftiTools  
indicates  that only three CIFTI intents are supported:  “dtseries,  ”“dscalar,  ”and “dlabel. ”Moreover,  tools receiving  
checkmarks  in the same column may enable the task to diﬀerent  extents. For example,  the manipulation  functions  
in hcp-utils  support normalizing  data values and applying  a parcellation,  whereas  those in cifti-matlab  
support data and metadata  replacement.  While ciftiTools  is designed  to support all listed tasks, other tools are 
not meant to support all these tasks on their own. For example,  hcp-utils  is designed  to be used in conjunction  
with NiBabel  and nilearn  . Lastly, note that some tools have external  dependencies:  ciftiTools  also requires  
the Connectome  Workbench  for most of its functionality,  ggsegExtra  requires  FreeSurfer  for reading in new 
parcellations,  and ciftify  uses FSL, FreeSurfer  and the Connectome  Workbench  to convert and manipulate  CIFTI 
ﬁles. An asterisk has been added to the “Language  ”c o l u m n  for these tools to indicate  the need for additional  
software.

from any ""xifti""  object, allowing  for direct visualization,  resampling,  
and manipulation  of surface geometry  data in the absence  of metric or 
label data. 
The function  is.xifti  can be used to verify that an R object is a 
correctly-formatted  ""xifti""  object. This validation  is especially  useful 
if the user has manually  manipulated  the data or metadata  in a ""xifti""  
and requires  it to be correctly  formatted,  for example  if they plan to 
write it to a ﬁle, visualize  it, or further process  it with ciftiTools  . 
Several  S3 methods  are implemented  in ciftiTools  . S3 methods  
control the behaviors  of certain base R functions  when applied  to ob- 
jects of a speciﬁc  class. Currently,  ""xifti""  objects have S3 methods  
for summary  , print , plot , and several mathematical  operations.  For 
example,  plot(xii)  will invoke the functions  view_xifti_surface  
and/or view_xifti_volume  , as described  in Section  2.3 . ""surf""  
objects have S3 methods  for summary  , print , and plot . For both 
""xifti""  and ""surf""  objects,  summary  and print will display  an 
overview  of the object’s  contents.  Other S3 methods  for ""xifti""  and 
""surf""  objects are described  in the corresponding  subsections  below. 
2.2. Reading  and writing 
Figure 1 A shows how the ciftiTools  function  read_xifti  im- 
ports CIFTI data into R as a ""xifti""  object. read_xifti  may also im- 
port GIFTI surface geometry  data alongside  the CIFTI data. Any surfaces  
will be resampled  to match the cortical  data resolution  in the CIFTI, if 
there is a diﬀerence  in resolution.  The ﬂow of data is reversed  when a 
""xifti""  is written  out with write_xifti  : surfaces,  if any, are written  
to GIFTI ﬁles, and everything  else is written  to a CIFTI ﬁle. 
Two functions,  as.xifti  and read_xifti2  , provide  alterna-  
tive methods  for constructing  a ""xifti""  object. as.xifti  creates a 
""xifti""  from R data matrices  instead  of a CIFTI ﬁle, allowing  the 
user to store grayordinate  data which may not originate  from real neu- 
roimaging,  e.g. simulated  data. For example,  with as.xifti  the user 
can simulate  data using a number  of powerful  simulation  tools in R, and 
then format the data as ""xifti""  grayordinate  data. This ""xifti""  can 
then be analyzed  with ciftiTools  , or it can be written  to a CIFTI ﬁle 
for analysis  or visualization  with methods  and software  outside  of R. 
The other alternative  function,  read_xifti2  , creates a ""xifti""  from 
GIFTI metric or label ﬁles instead  of a CIFTI ﬁle. It is provided  to allow for greater ﬂexibility  in analyses  that are focused  on the cortical  surface 
speciﬁcally,  which would not require  the CIFTI format.  
Additional  functions  related to reading  and writing  include  
separate_xifti  , which splits a CIFTI ﬁle into GIFTI metric or la- 
bel ﬁles for the cortical  data and a NIFTI ﬁle for the subcortical  
data, and info_xifti  , which reads in only the metadata  of a CIFTI 
ﬁle. write_xifti2  does the opposite  of read_xifti2  : it writes a 
""xifti""  with surface data to GIFTI metric or label ﬁles. And for sur- 
faces, read_surf  and write_surf  translate  between  GIFTI surface 
geometry  ﬁles and ""surf""  objects.  
A ""xifti""  object can also be written  to an RDS data ﬁle using 
saveRDS  , and read back in with readRDS  , both base R functions.  This 
allows R users to store CIFTI data and GIFTI surfaces  in a single ﬁle. 
However,  RDS ﬁles are generally  not compatible  with other program-  
ming platforms  such as MATLAB  or Python.  Users interested  in cross- 
platform  compatibility  should instead  use write_xifti  to generate  
CIFTI and GIFTI surface geometry  ﬁles for subsequent  use with MAT- 
LAB, Python,  or other tools (see Section  4.4 ).

sus on the neurofunctional  basis of the alteration  ( Brambilla  et al., 2003 ; 
Johnson,  2004 ; Dawson  et al., 2005 ; Simmons  et al., 2009 ; Cook et al., 
2012 ). 
Is face perception  unique in degree or kind of cognitive  and neural 
mechanisms,  and in its relevance  for social cognition?  Other visual stim- 
uli that also support  social cognitive  tasks, such as bodies and biologi-  
cal motion ( Atkinson  et al., 2011 ), may recruit analogous  mechanisms  
( Reed et al., 2006 ; Troje and Westhoﬀ,  2006 ). For example,  the inver- 
sion eﬀect has been reported  in single body perception  (body inversion  
eﬀect or BIE; Reed et al., 2003 , 2006 ), both in the behavioral  perfor- 
mance,  and in the electroencephalography  signal ( Stekelenburg  and De 
Gelder,  2004 ; Orlandi  and Proverbio,  2020 ; Adibpour  et al., 2021 ). How- 
ever, other behavioral  and fMRI studies have shown inconsistent  results,  
questioning  whether  the inversion  eﬀect provides  a reliable  measure  of 
body perception,  and whether  body perception  recruits  conﬁgural  pro- 
cessing at all ( Brandman  and Yovel, 2012 , 2016 ; but see Axelsson  et al., 
2022 ). Therefore,  faces so far remain the best understood  case of visual 
specialization  mediated  by conﬁgural  processing.  
More recent research  indicates  an uncharted  class of stimuli,  whose 
visual processing  might be analogous  to faces. Members  of this class are 
two-body  shapes,  that is, conﬁgurations  of two bodies spatially  close 
and face-to-face,  as is (proto)typical  of a social interaction  ( Papeo et al., 
2017 ; Papeo, 2020 ). Much of what we learn about social life, and how 
we regulate  our social behavior  here and now , depends  on the observa-  
tion of people interacting  with people ( Quadﬂieg  and Koldewyn,  2017 ; 
Powell and Spelke,  2018 ). Thus, the visual specialization  for face-to-face  
body dyads (hereafter,  facing dyads) might respond  to the need for eﬃ- 
cient detection  and recognition  of social interaction  in the cluttered  and 
crowded  visual world. 
It has been suggested  that visual processing  of facing dyads shares 
with face processing  a particular  sensitivity  to inversion:  In fast visual 
categorization  ( i.e. , discrimination  of bodies from other objects),  sub- 
jects’ performance  drops dramatically  for inverted  facing dyads, rela- 
tive to the same dyads presented  upright  ( Papeo et al., 2017 ; Papeo and 
Abassi, 2019 ). The cost of inversion  for facing dyads is signiﬁcantly  
larger than the cost of inversion  for identical  bodies in a non-facing  con- 
ﬁguration  ( e.g. , back-to-back  bodies),  an eﬀect known as the two-body  
inversion  eﬀect (2BIE). 
What is the two-body  inversion  eﬀect? The present  study asked whether  
the 2BIE could be a) an index of visual specialization  mediated  by con- 
ﬁgural processing,  and b) a reliable  measure  of the individual  visuoper-  
ceptual  functions  that traﬃc in social perception  and cognition.  
To address  the ﬁrst question,  we tested whether  activity  in person-  
perception  (face- and body-speciﬁc)  visual areas of the occipitotemporal  
cortex showed  two well established  signatures  of conﬁgural  processing  
during perception  of facing dyads. The ﬁrst neural signature  of conﬁg- 
ural face processing  is greater activity  for faces relative  to scrambled  or 
scattered  faces ( Brandman  and Yovel, 2016 ). Thus, if facing dyads re- 
cruit conﬁgural  processing,  they should evoke greater activity  in visual 
areas, relative  to their scattered  counterparts,  i.e. , stimuli featuring  the 
same parts (bodies)  in a non-facing  conﬁguration.  The second signature  
of conﬁgural  processing  targeted  here is the inversion  eﬀect: We studied  
whether  the 2BIE captured  in the subjects’  behavior  predicts  the activ- 
ity of visual areas in response  to upright  vs. inverted  dyads, just like 
the FIE predicts  the response  to upright  vs. inverted  faces in the face- 
speciﬁc  visual cortex ( Yovel and Kanwisher,  2005 ). To test these eﬀects, 
we recorded  neural activity  using fMRI, while healthy  subjects  viewed  
upright  or inverted  facing and non-facing  dyads. On a diﬀerent  day, the 
same subjects  performed  a visual categorization  task to measure  the be- 
havioral  2BIE ( Papeo et al., 2017 ). We tested the visual speciﬁcity  of 
the whole-dyad  conﬁguration  considering  both the diﬀerence  in neu- 
ral activity  for upright  facing vs. non-facing  dyads, and the diﬀerence  
in the eﬀect of inversion  for facing vs. non-facing  dyads ( i.e. , whether  
neural activity  mirrored  the behavioral  2BIE), in person-perception  vi- 
sual areas, and in the whole brain. We repeated  the same analyses  on 
an independent  set of data, collected  during the presentation  of upright  or inverted  single bodies (and non-body  objects as a control).  With this 
second study, we aimed to shed light on the relationship  between  body 
and body-dyad  processing,  testing whether  the two types of stimuli give 
rise to comparable  eﬀects. 
To address  the second question  concerning  the relationship  between  
2BIE and interindividual  diﬀerences,  subjects  performed  the visual cat- 
egorization  task a second time after weeks, so that we could estimate  
the stability  of the 2BIE over time. They also completed  the Autism-  
Spectrum  Quotient  Test (AQ), a measure  of the autism-spectrum  traits, 
sensitive  to interindividual  diﬀerences  in the general  population,  with 
respect to socially  relevant  cognitive  abilities  ( Baron-Cohen  et al., 2001 ; 
Ruzich et al., 2015 ). With caution  due to a small sample size for corre- 
lational  analyses,  we used this dataset to begin exploring  the test-retest  
reliability  of the 2BIE, and the relationship  between  the 2BIE and the 
AQ. We aimed to provide  ﬁrst-pass  indication  that the way in which in- 
dividuals  process  social scenes can capture  individual  diﬀerences  in the 
visuoperceptual  foundations  of social cognition.  
2. Material  and Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Thirty subjects  took part in the fMRI study (16 female;  mean age 
24.8 years ± 4.6 SD ). This number  respected  the sample size required  to 
obtain a diﬀerence  of activity  for facing vs. non-facing  dyads in body- 
perception  visual cortex, comparable  to a previous  study with similar 
task and design (required  sample size = 30, for Cohen’s  d = 0.692 with 
power = 0.95, alpha = 0.05; Abassi and Papeo, 2020 ). All subjects  had 
normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and reported  no history of psy- 
chiatric  or neurological  disorders,  or use of psychoactive  medications.  
They were screened  for contraindications  to fMRI and gave written  in- 
formed  consent  before participation.  Of the 30 subjects  who enrolled  
in the fMRI experiment,  23 agreed to come back twice, to take part in 
two sessions  of the behavioral  study (13 females;  mean age 24.6 years 
± 4.5 SD ). This number  respected  the sample size required  to obtain 
a 2BIE comparable  to previous  research  with similar task and design 
(required  sample size = 22, for Cohen’s  d = 0.824 with power = 0.95, 
alpha = 0.05; Abassi and Papeo, 2020 ). From behavioral  and fMRI data 
analyses,  we excluded  one subject for whom average  performance  in 
the behavioral  task was > 3 SD above the group mean. Thus, the ﬁnal 
fMRI analyses  included  29 participants,  and the ﬁnal behavioral  analy- 
ses included  22 participants.  This study was approved  by the local ethics 
committee  (CPP Sud Est V, CHU de Grenoble).  
2.2. Stimuli 
2.2.1. Behavioral  study 
Sixteen  grayscale  renderings  of single human bodies in proﬁle view 
and various  biomechanically  possible  poses, were created  and edited 
with Daz3D (Daz Productions,  Salt Lake City) and the Image Process-  
ing Toolbox  of MATLAB  (The MathWorks  Inc, Natick,  Massachusetts).  
As many bodies were obtained  by ﬂipping  horizontally  each unique 
body, which yielded  to a total of 32 single bodies. Sixteen  facing dyads 
were created  from the 32 single bodies, and then they were horizontally  
ﬂipped to create 16 new dyads, for a total of 32 facing dyads. Non-facing  
dyads were created  by swapping  the position  of the two bodies in each 
facing dyad ( i.e. , the body on the left side was moved to the right side 
and vice versa ). The distance  between  bodies ( i.e. , the distance  between  
the two closest points of the two bodies in a dyad) was matched  across 
facing and non-facing  stimuli (mean facing = 82.88 pixels ± 1",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5682, 5685), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8880, 8882), match='3.'>"

( Huerta and Volpe, 2009 ). Since TMS represents  a safe and nonin- 
vasive approach,  several stimulation  devices  and protocols  have re- 
ceived the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) approval  for the treat- 
ment of medication-resistant  Depression  ( Connolly  et al., 2012 ), Mi- 
graine ( Schwedt  and Vargas,  2015 ), Obsessive  Compulsive  Disorder  
( Stultz et al., 2020 ) and smoking  cessation  ( Young et al., 2021 ). How- 
ever, beyond  that, most other TMS protocols  have only reached  a level 
B evidence  (probable  eﬃcacy)  for the treatment  of speciﬁc  symptoms  
in other pathologies,  such as stroke, ﬁbromyalgia,  multiple  sclerosis,  
Parkinson’s  disease  and posttraumatic  stress disorder  ( Lefaucheur  et al., 
2020 ). A major concern  to TMS applications  is the consistency  and 
replicability  of its ﬁndings  due to the high inter-subject  variability  
( Lopez-Alonso  et al., 2014 ; Nettekoven  et al., 2015 ; Terranova  et al., 
2019 ; Belardinelli  et al., 2019 ; Corp et al., 2021 ; Valero-Cabrè et  al., 
2017 ). Apart from dosing and stimulation  parameters,  another  impor- 
tant source of variability  is the selection  of the stimulation  sites, which in 
most studies is chosen based on approximate  anatomical  landmarks  (e.g. 
based on the 10–20 electroencephalography-EEG  system,  or the “5 cm 
rule ”f o r the selection  of dorsolateral  prefrontal  areas). Indeed,  most 
TMS studies use anatomical  coordinates  derived  from common  brain 
templates  to determine  stimulation  spots in non-motor  regions  with an 
implicit  assumption  that a given anatomical  region in the cortex is part 
of the same network  or involved  in the same brain function  across indi- 
viduals.  Considering  the extensive  variability  in individual  brain mor- 
phology  especially  within higher order associative/heteromodal  cortices  
( Doucet et al., 2019 ) further transformation  of these average  brain co- 
ordinates  into individual  MRI space makes it hardly possible  to target 
functionally  identical  cortical  nodes across subjects  and most probably  
contributes  to variability  in TMS evoked  brain responses  derived  from 
non-motor  brain regions  ( Ozdemir  et al., 2021 ). This results in poor 
consistency  of the stimulated  areas across study participants,  which 
can be largely overcome  by means of more personalized  approaches,  
for example  relying on the combination  of TMS and neuroimaging  
data for individual  target selection.  In the past years, this has been a 
hot topic across research  groups,  proving  how individualized,  network-  
based approaches  might enhance  the eﬃcacy  of circuit-based  interven-  
tions ( Nestor and Blumberger,  2020 ), both in healthy  young partici-  
pants ( Ozdemir  et al., 2020 ), as well as in pathological  population,  
such as patients  suﬀering  from Depression  ( Cash et al., 2020 ; Moreno-  
Ortega et al., 2020 ; Siddiqi et al., 2020 ). Furthermore,  recent evidence  
points in the direction  of brain functional  patterns  to represent  unique 
signature  of the individual  brain ( Finn et al., 2015 ), and so the evoked  
responses  to TMS to be highly individual-speciﬁc  ( Ozdemir  et al., 2021 ). 
Although  greater consistency  in stimulation  targets might not be di- 
rectly linked to greater therapeutic  eﬃcacy,  consistency  across TMS 
studies might be achieved  via individualized  target selection  by tak- 
ing into account  the underlying,  highly variable,  brain structural  and 
functional  pathways  reported  to aﬀect neuronal  response  propagation  
patterns  to TMS ( Momi et al., 2021 ). Indeed,  previous  studies have 
reported  the reliability  of the induced  responses  following  individual-  
ized, neuronavigated,  TMS applied  to dorsolateral  prefrontal  or motor 
areas ( Lioumis  et al., 2009 ). Similarly,  the strongest  behavioral  eﬀect 
sizes have been reported  in studies employing  personalized  TMS tar- 
geting based on functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) con- 
nectivity,  compared  to studies employing  targeting  based on structural,  
population-derived  coordinates  or EEG electrodes  positions  ( Sack et al., 
2009 ). Diﬀerently  from prior studies (see for example  ( Ozdemir  et al., 
2020 ; Lioumis  et al., 2009 )), here we aimed at assessing  the eﬃcacy  and 
reproducibility  of the induced  response  across diﬀerent  scales (network  
and electrode  level) comparing  diﬀerent  degrees  of personalized  stim- 
ulation.  To address  this, we compared  the amount  of induced  activity  
and test-retest  reliability  to a single pulse TMS protocol  targeting  ei- 
ther i) group-derived,  generic  stimulation  targets ( g ) or ii) personalized  
sites based on the individual  functional  neuroimaging  data ( i ). In partic- 
ular, group-based  versus individualized  targeting  was assessed  on two 
resting state networks:  the Dorsal Attention  (DAN) and Default  Mode (DMN) Networks.  The eﬃcacy  of the diﬀerent  stimulation  protocols  was 
measured  in terms of the induced  activity  recorded  in the surrounding  
electrodes,  as well as in spatially  deﬁned  network  maps. Furthermore,  
the reliability  across visits of such measures  was also compared.  We 
chose the right superior  parietal  gyrus (SPG) and the right angular  gyrus 
(ANG) as targeting  points for the stimulation  of the DAN and DMN re- 
spectively.  The deﬁnitions  of such targets on the cortex was achieved  
either via a group-derived  (atlas-based)  network  maps morphed  on the 
individual  anatomy  (for the g condition),  or by means of data-driven  
seed-to-voxel  analyses  (for the i condition).  As a result, diﬀerent  net- 
work maps were employed  to individuate  the stimulation  target and for 
the subsequent  analysis  of the TMS-EEG  response.  We hypothesized  that 
stimulation  of functionally  individualized  network  nodes would result 
in better network  engagement  (i.e., eﬃcacy  of stimulation  in activating  
the targeted  network);  as well as higher reliability  of such measure.  In- 
deed, TMS coil placement  is usually  based on either anatomical  target 
or based on group-derived  functional  network  maps. However,  this lat- 
ter approach  can inadvertently  target diﬀerent  functional  networks,  due 
to the fact that networks’  spatial distribution  is highly variable  across 
subjects,  yet reliable  within ( Oathes et al., 2021 ), such as that diﬀer- 
ent networks  may occupy the same anatomical  location  across subjects  
( Gordon  et al., 2017 ; Lynch et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, more pre- 
cise targeting  can be achieved  when considering  the individual  func- 
tional connectivity  proﬁle ( Lynch et al., 2022 ). Indeed,  recent literature  
suggests  that, if our aim is to stimulate  an individual  brain area, stim- 
ulation targets based on the individual  functional  connectivity  to that 
area increase  our chances  of reliably  target it ( Oathes et al., 2021 ). Our 
rationale  was hence that the readout  of the induced  activity  in a network  
following  its individualized  targeting  should be a more solid estimate,  
especially  across visits, of its true state of activation,  compared  to what 
measured  from a general  parcellation  scheme  following  stimulation  of 
a general  target. Hence, individualized  stimulation  based on functional  
connectivity  should allow us to more reliably  target the desired  individ-  
ual network  across visits ( Oathes et al., 2021 ) 
Finally,  because  individualized  targeting  inevitably  brings the need 
to address  the cost/beneﬁts  ratio, we further compared  the eﬃcacy  and 
reliability  of two diﬀerent  degrees  of personalization  in a small sub- 
sample of our participants.  This was achieved  by assessing  whether  in- 
dividualization  based on identifying  network  topographies/maps  using 
independent  component  analyses  (ICA) approach  for each subject would 
further enhance  stimulation  eﬃcacy  and reliability.  This check is neces- 
sary to determine  if individualized  protocols,  that are necessarily  more 
expensive  and time consuming,  are worth in face of simpler  and more 
straightforward  approaches.

2.1. Participants  
Based on prior published  work ( Lioumis  et al., 2009 ; Sack et al., 
2009 ; Kerwin  et al., 2018 ), a sample size of 24 healthy  participants  (16 
males, age = 29.67 ± 10.6 years, range 19–49 years old) was employed  
in this study. Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from each partic- 
ipant prior to volunteering.  The study was approved  by the Beth Israel 
Deaconess  Medical  Center Review  Board and conducted  in line with the 
Declaration  of Helsinki.  
2.2. Neuroimaging  data acquisition  and preprocessing  
All subjects  underwent  the acquisition  of structural  and functional

Twenty-four  right-handed  Mandarin-English  bilinguals  participated  
in this study (age 25.3 ± 5.6 years; nine males).  We aimed to recruit 
bilinguals  who were as balanced  as possible  between  the two languages,

becoming  one of the most widely implemented  modalities  for measur-  
ing brain activity  with a rapidly  growing  literature  on analysis  methods  
( Biswal et al., 1995 ; Fox et al., 2005 ; Vincent  et al., 2007 ; Thomas  Yeo 
et al., 2011 ; Liska et al., 2015 ; Gozzi and Schwarz,  2016 ; Xu et al., 
2020 ). Yet, instances  where BOLD-fMRI  measures  are used to inform 
clinical  practice  are uncommon  ( O’Connor  and Zeﬃro,  2019 ), with 
the exception  of pre-surgical  mapping  ( Fox et al., 2016 ; Dimou et al., 
2013 ; Matthews  et al., 2006 ). This lack of translation  is in part due to 
the BOLD-signal  being a cell-type  agnostic  measure  that is sensitive  to 
changes  in blood oxygenation,  ﬂow, and volume,  rather than a direct 
measure  of neural activity  ( Logothetis  and Wandell,  2004 ). This limits 
our understanding  of the biological  basis for measures  of brain func- 
tion estimated  from the BOLD-signal.  At the preclinical  level, we can 
bridge this gap with the use of complementary  neuroimaging  modes, in 
this case wide-ﬁeld  optical imaging,  that oﬀer more direct measures  of 
neural activity  with cell-type  speciﬁcity  ( Barron et al., 2021 ). Here, we 
apply analysis  methods  commonly  used on BOLD-fMRI  data in a murine  
wide-ﬁeld  optical imaging  dataset.  This trans-disciplinary  application  
of analysis  techniques  aims to cross-pollinate  ideas about how to char- 
acterize  brain functional  organization  across neuroimaging  ﬁelds and 
species.  
1.2. Wide-ﬁeld  ‘mesoscale’  optical imaging  
Among  optical imaging  techniques,  wide-ﬁeld  imaging  oﬀers a bal- 
ance between  resolution  and ﬁeld-of-view  (FOV). For a recent review 
of wide-ﬁeld  (or mesoscale)  optical imaging,  herein ‘mesoscale  imag- 
ing’, refer to Cardin et al. (2020) . Using a microscope  coupled  camera,  
this mode can capture  the mouse neocortex  (1.5 ×1.5cm 2 ) ( Silasi et al., 
2016 ) with a spatial resolution  of a few tens of microns  and temporal  res- 
olution  on the order of 10-50Hz  ( Bouchard  et al., 2009 ; Ackman  et al., 
2012 ; Vanni and Murphy,  2014 ). The data are two-dimensional  with 
the signal being a mixture  of sources  in depth. This spatiotemporal  res- 
olution  is substantially  higher than typical murine  fMRI data (where 
voxels are hundreds  of microns,  and data are acquired  at ∼1Hz). Be- 
sides these gains in resolution,  mesoscale  imaging  can access intrin- 
sic, ﬂuorescent  and luminescent  sources  of contrast  ( Grinvald  et al., 
1987 ; Lin and Schnitzer,  2016 ). Here, we focus on ﬂuorescent  calcium  
(Ca 2 + ) imaging.  These data have a high signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR) 
and oﬀer cell-type  speciﬁcity  ( Chen et al., 2013 ; Higley and Sabatini,  
2008 ; Dana et al., 2016 ). While the data reported  here are from trans- 
genic animals  (with genetically  encoded  GCaMP),  the preprocessing  
pipeline  and analysis  methods  we use are broadly  applicable  to other 
ﬂuorescent  indicators  (e.g., RCaMP),  data from virally transfected  an- 
imals, and other optical signal sources  provided  they have a suﬃcient  
SNR.

2.1. Prior literature  utilizing  injectable  tract tracers 
Injectable  tract tracers in animals  have been used since the early 
1980s to identify  patterns  of connectivity  between  injected  targets and 
the matrix and striosome  compartments.  We identiﬁed  publications  
that utilized  injected  tract tracing techniques  to study striatal compart-  
ment connectivity  using serial Pubmed  searches  with “striatum  inject ”
and one of the following  terms: matrix,  striosome,  patch, or compart-  
ment. We sought to identify  any study that characterized  connectivity  
with the striatum  at the compartment  level, including  those that uti- 
lized tritiated  amino acids, biocytin,  cholera  toxin B, FluoroGold  TM , 
horseradish  peroxidase,  and Phaseolus  vulgaris  -leucoagglutinin.  We in- 
cluded all regions  with data from at least two animals  ( Smith et al., 
2016 ; McGregor  et al., 2019 ; Goldman-Rakic,  1982 ; Donoghue  and 
Herkenham,  1986 , 20 ; Eblen and Graybiel,  1995 ; Gerfen,  1984 , 1989 ;

Unzai et al., 2015 ) These searches  and review of references  from these 
articles  yielded  42 regions  in which connectivity  was reported  at the 
compartment  level (Supplemental  Table 1). 
2.2. Participants  
We utilized  three distinct  cohorts  of healthy  volunteers,  totaling  123 
Participants,  all scanned  at an MRI ﬁeld strength  of 3T (scan session 
details per cohort are described  below).  Striatal  segmentation  in one 
subject was judged to be unreliable  (unmeasurable  connectivity  for mul- 
tiple tested regions)  so was excluded  from further analysis,  yielding  a 
ﬁnal combined  cohort of 122 participants.  These participants  have been 
described  previously  ( Perlis et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2010 ; Blood et al., 
2012 ; Waugh et al., 2016 ; Bruggemann  et al., 2016 ; Hanssen  et al., 2018 ; 
Waugh et al., 2019 ), but none have been previously  assessed  via the 
methods  described  here. The mean age of this cohort was 35.0 years 
(range: 18–74).  One hundred  ten participants  were right-handed,  ten 
were left-handed,  and two were ambidextrous.  Fifty-eight  participants  
were female;  sixty-four  were male. These individuals  were recruited  as 
control participants  for three distinct  disease-related  protocols,  each of 
which was approved  by the Institutional  Review  Board for the respective

institution.  All participants  screened  negative  for any prior neurologic  
or psychiatric  history.  Participants  were provided  with printed  materials  
describing  the respective  research  protocol  and were encouraged  to ask 
questions  regarding  the study. We obtained  written  consent  for all par- 
ticipants.  All research  was conducted  in accordance  with the principles  
in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  
Cohort A: Thirty-six  participants  were scanned  at the MGH Martinos  
Center for Biomedical  Imaging  (Charlestown,  MA, USA). 64, 65, 68 Their 
self-identiﬁed  ethnic makeup  was: 3 African  American;  5 Asian; 27 
Caucasian;  1 multiracial.  The mean age of this cohort was 40.5 years 
(range: 18–74).  Thirty-three  participants  were right-handed,  two were 
left-handed,  and one was ambidextrous.  Twenty  participants  were fe- 
male; 16 were male. Thirty-one  participants  were scanned  on a Siemens  
Tim Trio MRI; ﬁve participants  were scanned  on a Siemens  Allegra  MRI. 
This cohort was utilized  to establish  the tractographic  method  described  
below; this method  was then tested using Cohorts  B and C. Fourteen  of 
these participants  were scanned  a second time, always utilizing  the same 
MRI scanner  for both acquisitions.  We compared  voxel location  between  
the two scans to assess the longitudinal  validity  of the technique.  
Cohort B: Twenty-six  participants  were scanned  at the University  of 
Lübeck (Lübeck,  Germany).  ( Bruggemann  et al., 2016 ; Hanssen  et al., 
2018 ) All participants  were ethnic Filipinos.  The mean age of this co- 
hort was 35.7 years (range: 19–53).  Twenty-ﬁve  participants  were right- 
handed,  and one was ambidextrous.  Seven participants  were female;  19 
were male. Twenty-three  were scanned  on a Philips Achieva  MRI; 3 were 
scanned  on a Philips Ingenia  MRI. 
Cohort C: Sixty-one  participants  were scanned  at the MGH Athinoula  
A. Martinos  Center for Biomedical  Imaging  (Charlestown,  MA, USA). 
( Perlis et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2010 ) Their self-identiﬁed  ethnic makeup  
was: 6 African  American;  5 Asian; 48 Caucasian;  2 Native American.  The 
mean age of this cohort was 31.5 years (range: 19–54).  Fifty-three  par- 
ticipants  were right-handed;  8 were left-handed.  Thirty-one  participants  
were female;  30 were male. All participants  were scanned  on the same 
Siemens  Tim Trio MRI described  for Cohort A.

Gelder,  2014 ) are aﬀected  by body postures  signaling  emotion.  Also, fa- 
cial expression  inﬂuences  body expression  categorization  ( Willis et al., 
2011 ). These behavioral  studies show that bodies and faces are not 
processed  independently.  Also, some fMRI studies suggested  that bod- 
ies and faces interact  in face and body selective  areas (for review,  see 
Hu et al. (2020) ). Indeed,  human fMRI studies ( Bernstein  et al., 2014 ; 
Song et al., 2013 ) comparing  activations  to persons  with those to iso- 
lated faces and headless  bodies, reported  evidence  for face-body  inte- 
gration  in anterior  but not posterior  body and face-selective  regions.  
However,  other human fMRI studies ( Kaiser et al., 2014 ; Kliger and 
Yovel, 2020 ) found that the activation  patterns  to persons  were merely 
a linear, weighted  mean response  of the activation  patterns  to headless  
bodies and faces, suggesting  separate  processing  of bodies and faces. 
This has been observed  also in another  study ( Yang et al., 2017 ) in the 
EBA, but not in the OFA, nor in the fusiform  gyrus. In sum, although  the 
evidence  is still ambiguous  across studies,  there appears  to be face-body  
interaction  in anterior,  fusiform  areas. 
In nonhuman  primates,  the only existing  fMRI study ( Fisher and Frei- 
wald, 2015 ) addressing  the question  of face-body  interaction,  observed  
superadditive  activation  to images of monkeys,  compared  to the sum of 
the activations  to the face and the (headless)  body in one anterior  face 
patch of the dorsal bank of the Superior  Temporal  Sulcus (STS; anterior  
fundus face patch AF). No superadditive  interactions  were observed  in 
the body patches.  A recording  study in posterior  ventral STS (posterior  
lateral (PL) and middle lateral (ML)) face patches  reported  responses  of 
face-selective  multi-unit  clusters  to occluded  faces when the body was 
present,  showing  an eﬀect of body context  on responses  of face-selective  
units ( Arcaro et al., 2020 ). These electrophysiological  ﬁndings  in mon- 
key face patches  are in line with monkey  ( Fisher and Freiwald,  2015 ) 
and human fMRI ( Cox et al., 2004 ) studies that showed  that a blurred  
head without  identiﬁable  face features  on top of a body can activate  
a face-selective  region. However,  the monkey  fMRI data did not show 
contextual  eﬀects in ML, the patch where the recordings  ( Arcaro et al., 
2020 ) were obtained.  Older single-unit  studies in the macaque  STS spo- 
radically  observed  neurons  that responded  to a human but were irre- 
sponsive  to a face or headless  body presented  alone ( Wachsmuth  et al., 
1994 ). In addition,  these studies reported  neurons  in the STS whose re- 
sponse depended  on the pose of both the head and the body ( Jellema  and 
Perrett,  2003 ), but is unclear  how these few recorded  neurons  relate to 
the fMRI-deﬁned  category-selective  patches.  
Given the conceptual  importance  of possible  face-body  integration  
in the temporal  cortex ( Hu et al., 2020 ; Taubert  et al., 2022a ), the in- 
consistency  of the results across previous  studies,  and the possibility  to 
study this at the single-unit  level in nonhuman  primates,  we revisited  
this issue in the present  monkey  fMRI study. Instead  of focusing  on the 
face or body patches,  in the ﬁrst experiment  we mapped  activations  to 
whole monkey  images throughout  the IT. This experiment  served as a 
localizer  for “monkey  ”patches,  i.e. patches  in IT that are more activated  
by monkey  images compared  to control objects.  These monkey  patches  
could overlap  with the face and/or body patches  but potentially  also 
included  regions  activated  by whole monkeys  and not, or much less so, 
by faces or bodies in isolation.  In addition,  we compared  the activations  
to the whole monkeys  to those for faces and headless  bodies. Also, as a 
ﬁrst test for superadditive  interactions,  we contrasted  the activations  to 
the monkey  with the sum of face and body activations.  
In the second experiment,  we examined  the interaction  between  bod- 
ies and faces in the monkey  patches,  identiﬁed  in Experiment  1. We em- 
ployed images of whole monkeys,  i.e. natural  face-body  conﬁgurations,  
and of unnatural  face-body  conﬁgurations  in which the face was mislo- 
cated with respect to the body. We presented  also their corresponding  
faces or bodies at the same location  and with the same size as in the con- 
ﬁgurations.  This allowed  for a rigorous  comparison  of the activations  to 
the face-body  conﬁgurations  with those to the isolated  faces and bod- 
ies. Thus, we could assess the presence  of superadditive  responses  to 
the conﬁguration.  The second purpose  of Experiment  2 was to exam- 
ine whether  temporal  visual cortical  areas are sensitive  to the face-body  conﬁguration.  Indeed,  even without  superadditive  responses,  it is still 
possible  that these neurons  show sensitivity  to the face-body  conﬁgu-  
ration. We examined  this possibility  in two ways. First, with univari-  
ate analyses,  we assessed  whether  temporal  visual cortex activations  
are stronger  for natural  compared  to unnatural  face-body  conﬁgura-  
tions. Second,  we employed  a multiple  regression  approach,  similar to 
Kaiser et al. (2014) and Kliger and Yovel (2020) , to predict the pattern  
of activations  to the face-body  conﬁguration  from the weighted  linear 
combination  of the face and body activations.  This regression  analyses  
were performed  separately  for the natural  and unnatural  face-body  con- 
ﬁgurations  in each of the monkey  patches  deﬁned  in Experiment  1, al- 
lowing us to assess whether  the face-body  interaction  diﬀered  between  
these two conﬁgurations.  We predicted  that, if present,  the face-body  
interactions  are more prominent  in anterior  than in posterior  patches,  
as expected  from the human fMRI literature  ( Hu et al., 2020 ). 
Currently,  models based on deep convolutional  neural network  
(CNN) architectures  are the best ones we have for visual process-  
ing in the ventral visual stream ( Kriegeskorte,  2015 ; Yamins  and Di- 
Carlo, 2016 ). Thus, we presented  the stimuli of Experiment  2 to deep 
CNNs and compared  the activations  between  natural  and unnatural  con- 
ﬁgurations,  and to the bodies and faces, in diﬀerent  layers. We per- 
formed  the same analyses  on the activations  in diﬀerent  CNN layers 
and the fMRI activations,  allowing  for a comparison  between  the re- 
sponses  of the monkey  ventral stream and artiﬁcial  CNN layers. Because  
face-body  interactions  can be a result of exposure  to natural  face-body  
conﬁgurations  during development  ( Arcaro et al., 2020 ), we compared  
activations  to natural  and unnatural  conﬁgurations  in trained  and un- 
trained  (i.e. with random  weights)  CNNs, expecting  responses  that re- 
ﬂect an integration  of a body and face to be present  only in the trained  
CNNs. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
The experiments  were performed  with two male rhesus macaques  
(M1 and M2; Macaca  mulatta  ; 4–5 years, 6–8 kg). Both were implanted  
with MR-compatible  plastic headposts  for ﬁxing the head during train- 
ing and scanning.  All surgical  and experimental  procedures,  and ani- 
mal care, followed  the national  and European  regulations  and were ap- 
proved by the Animal  Ethical Committee  at KU Leuven.  
2.2. Stimuli 
Experiment  1 was designed  to map the face-, body- and whole- 
agent selective  regions  in the monkey  brain. In Experiment  2, we intro- 
duced natural  and unnatural  face-body  conﬁgurations,  and presented  
their respective  parts (faces and headless  bodies)  in separate  blocks. 
Both experiments  employed  static images (modiﬁed  from Shutterstock,  
https://www.shutterstock.com  ). The images were centered  on Brown 
noise (1/f 2 ) backgrounds,  resized to ﬁt the dimensions  of the screen. 
We opted for the Brown noise because  its power spectrum  is similar to 
the power spectra  of natural  images ( Isherwood  et al., 2017 ). All images 
used in the experiments,  including  the backgrounds,  were converted  to 
greyscale.  
2.2.1. Experiment  1 
For the face, body, and monkey  stimuli of Experiment  1, we selected  
60 high-resolution  images of conspeciﬁcs  in their natural  environment,  
in various  postures  and orientations  (frontal  and lateral views only). 
From that set, we prepared  three groups of 20 stimuli:  faces only, bod- 
ies only, and whole monkeys.  The faces and the bodies were cropped  
from the monkey  images.  Left and right lateral views of the faces, bod- 
ies, and monkeys  were balanced  within each group. The hemiﬁeld  lo- 
cation (left versus right) of the head was also balanced  in the monkey

group. We equated  sex when primary  and secondary  sexual characteris-  
tics were visible or discriminative  in order to reduce possible  diﬀerential  
aﬀective  responses  to the images.  Additionally,  we prepared  20 control 
objects for each of the groups.  All images were resized so that their 
maximal  vertical  or horizontal  extent was 6°. Out of a set of 230 object 
images,  we selected  those that matched  the face, body or monkey  im- 
ages, respectively.  To select the best matching  objects,  we employed  11 
shape descriptors  quantifying  the aspect ratio, the area, and the shape 
of the stimuli (Suppl.  Fig. 1). We matched  the face, body, and monkey  
images to their control object images on these 11 parameters.  Exact nu- 
merical  matching  of the parameters  amongst  the members  of a pair of 
categories  was not always possible,  but the distributions  of the metrics  
(Suppl.  Fig. 1) overlapped  strongly.  A principal  components  (PC) anal- 
ysis of the measures  of all stimuli for the 11 shape descriptors  showed  
that the three groups were well matched  with their object control im- 
ages on the ﬁrst PC, which explained  48% of the variance  (Suppl.  Fig. 
2). The selected  images consisted  of manmade  objects,  such as tools, ve- 
hicles, musical  instruments,  shoes, hats, bags, utensils,  diﬀerent  types of 
gear, etc. We adjusted  the low-level  image characteristics  by equating  
the mean luminance  and contrast  across the whole set of stimuli in Ex- 
periment  1 (MATLAB  SHINE toolbox,  Willenbockel  et al. (2010) ). The 
images,  including  the backgrounds,  were presented  on the display  after 
gamma  correction.  Examples  are shown in Fig. 1 A-C. 2.2.2. Experiment  2 
For Experiment  2, we selected  a diﬀerent  set of 20 rhesus macaque  
images.  The images were isolated  from their backgrounds  and converted  
to greyscale,  as described  above. This was our natural  conﬁguration  con- 
dition. For the unnatural  conﬁgurations,  we cropped  the heads and at- 
tached them to a diﬀerent  part of the upper body, trying to avoid pos- 
sible occlusion  cues (e.g. that another  monkey  might be peeking  from 
behind the body). To maximize  the common  border between  the face 
and the body, we rotated  the head slightly  in some cases. The view- 
points and the left-right  hemiﬁeld  locations  were balanced  within each 
group. Examples  of natural  and unnatural  monkey  conﬁgurations  are 
shown in Fig. 1 D-F. 
Both natural  and unnatural  conﬁguration  images were ﬁtted into the 
6°x6°stimulus  window,  resulting  in slightly  diﬀerent  sizes and positions  
of their corresponding  bodies and faces. The faces / bodies of the corre- 
sponding  natural  and unnatural  conﬁgurations  diﬀered  from each other 
only in location  and to a smaller  extent in size and orientation.  The 
faces of the unnatural  conﬁgurations  were on average  0.9°more  eccen- 
tric than the faces of the natural  ones. To control for these diﬀerences,  
we presented  the bodies and the faces from the natural  and the unnatu-  
ral conﬁgurations  in separate  blocks. That way we could also compare  
the activation  to the whole with the sum of its corresponding  parts (face 
plus body) for the natural  and unnatural  conﬁgurations  separately.

with this account,  several studies of the eﬀects of DA at retrieval  
have reported  that secondary  task performance  suﬀers to a greater ex- 
tent in older than in young adults ( Anderson  et al., 1998 ; Craik and 
McDowd,  1987 ; Fernandes  and Moscovitch,  2003 ; Park et al., 1989 ; 
Whiting  and Smith, 1997 ; for review,  see Klib and Naveh-Benjamin  
2014 ). However,  the eﬀects of DA on retrieval  accuracy  have typically  
been age-invariant,  with some studies reporting  similar performance  
declines  in young and older adults under DA ( Fernandes  and Moscov-  
itch, 2003 ; Park et al., 1989 ; Whiting  and Smith, 1997 ), and others re- 
porting  little or no eﬀect of DA in either age group ( Anderson  et al., 
1998 ; Nyberg  et al., 1997 ). 
In a recent study, Horne et al. (2021) employed  fMRI to examine  the 
eﬀects of DA on the neural correlates  of retrieval  monitoring  - processes  
that act on the outcome  of a retrieval  attempt  in service of the retrieval  
goal - during associative  recognition  in young and older adults. Neu- 
ral correlates  of monitoring  were operationalized  as greater fMRI BOLD 
signal for test pairs endorsed  as ‘rearranged’  than for pairs correctly  
endorsed  as ‘intact’,  under the assumption  that the former class of judg- 
ments places heavier  demands  on monitoring  than the latter class (see 
de Chastelaine  et al. 2016 , Horne et al. 2021 for justiﬁcation  of this as- 
sumption].  The authors  predicted  that DA would further deplete  the al- 
ready limited domain  general  resources  available  to support  monitoring  
in older adults, leading  to an age-dependent  monitoring  impairment  and 
a concomitant  decline  in the magnitude  of monitoring-related  neural ac- 
tivity. Indeed,  DA led to an age-speciﬁc  reduction  in associative  recog- 
nition memory  performance  and, in addition,  to the elimination  in the 
older age group of the robust relationship  between  monitoring-related  
activity  and memory  performance  that was evident  when attention  was 
undivided.  Crucially,  though,  the magnitudes  of neural ‘monitoring  ef- 
fects’ did not diﬀer between  the divided  and full attention  conditions  in 
either age group. This null ﬁnding  prompted  the authors  to conjecture  
that the decline  in older adults’ memory  performance  under DA did not 
result from a monitoring  impairment  but, instead,  from impairment  of 
memory  processes  operating  ‘upstream’  of monitoring.  
In the present  study, we report the results of further analysis  of the 
data acquired  by Horne et al. (2021) . Rather than examining  neural 
monitoring  eﬀects, here we examined  the eﬀects of DA on neural cor- 
relates of recollection  (hereafter,  ‘recollection  eﬀects’)  –that is, the en- 
hanced  neural activity  elicited  by retrieval  cues associated  with success-  
ful as opposed  to unsuccessful  recollection  that we and others assume  to 
reﬂect processes  supporting  the retrieval  and representation  of episodic  
information  (e.g., Benoit and Schacter  2015 , Rugg and Vilberg  2013 ). 
Recollection  eﬀects have been extensively  examined  for more than two 
decades  in a variety of experimental  paradigms  (see Kim 2010 , 2013 and 
Rugg and Vilberg  2013 for reviews).  Successful  recollection  has consis- 
tently been associated  with enhanced  BOLD activity  (hereafter,  ‘recol- 
lection eﬀects’)  in a ‘core recollection  network’  that comprises  medial 
prefrontal  cortex (MPFC),  posterior  cingulate  (PCC)/retrosplenial  cor- 
tex, hippocampus,  parahippocampal  gyrus (PHC), left middle temporal  
gyrus (MTG) and left angular  gyrus (AG) ( King et al., 2015 ; Rugg and 
Vilberg,  2013 ). Of importance  in the present  context,  recollection  eﬀects 
in these regions  scale with the amount  of information  recollected  about 
the study event (e.g., Hutchinson  et al. 2014 , Rugg and Vilberg  2013 , 
Thakral  et al. 2015 , Yu et al. 2012a , 2012b ). 
Here, we report what to our knowledge  is the ﬁrst study to examine  
the inﬂuence  of DA at retrieval  on recollection  eﬀects in young and older 
adults (see Anderson  et al. 2000 , Fernandes  et al. 2006 for early studies 
of the eﬀects of DA on retrieval  that employed  blocked  experimental  de- 
signs). Given the ﬁndings  from a previous  aging study that employed  the 
same associative  recognition  memory  task ( de Chastelaine  et al., 2016 ), 
we predicted  that we would identify  robust and largely age-invariant  
recollection  eﬀects across the core recollection  network  when the task 
was performed  under full attention.  The key questions  concerned  the im- 
pact on these eﬀects of dividing  attention  between  memory  retrieval  and 
a secondary  task, and whether  any such impact is moderated  by age. In 
relation  to the ﬁrst question,  we note that while Horne et al. (2021) re- ported null eﬀects of DA on associative  recognition  performance  in their 
younger  sample (replicating  numerous  prior ﬁndings  –see above),  it is 
unknown  whether  such null behavioral  ﬁndings  extend to the neural 
correlates  of successful  memory  retrieval.  For example,  the insensitivity  
of memory  performance  to DA in young adults might be accompanied  by 
a reduction  in the amount  or richness  of retrieved  information  that is too 
subtle to be reﬂected  in typical behavioral  measures;  this would how- 
ever be expected  to show up as a reduction  in the magnitude  of recol- 
lection eﬀects in members  of the core recollection  network  (see above).  
Alternately,  preserved  performance  under DA might depend  on the al- 
location  of additional  neural resources  to the processing  of the retrieval  
cues, reﬂected  perhaps  in an enhancement  of the neural activity  elicited  
by both recollected  and unrecollected  test items. Moreover,  if the dele- 
terious eﬀect of DA on older adults’ memory  performance  reported  by 
Horne et al. (2021) reﬂects  interference  with processes  supporting  the 
retrieval  and representation  of episodic  information,  then DA should be 
associated  with the emergence  or exaggeration  of age diﬀerences  in rec- 
ollection  or cue processing  eﬀects. 
2. Methods  
A detailed  description  of the methods  can be found in the prior publi- 
cation where the behavioral  and monitoring-related  fMRI data from the 
present  study were ﬁrst reported  ( Horne et al., 2021 ). The study was 
approved  by the Institutional  Review  Boards of UT Dallas and The Uni- 
versity of Texas Southwestern  Medical  School.  All participants  provided  
written  informed  consent  prior to undertaking  the experiment  and re- 
ceived remuneration  of $30/hr.  The recollection-related  fMRI ﬁndings  
reported  below have not been described  previously.  
2.1. Participants  
Participants  were 28 young adults aged between  18–30 years and 
28 older adults aged 65–76 years. They were recruited  from the UT 
Dallas and surrounding  metropolitan  Dallas communities.  They were 
right-handed,  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision, and scored a 
minimum  of 27 on the Mini-Mental  State Examination  (MMSE).  Inclu- 
sion and exclusion  criteria  are described  in detail in Horne et al. (2021) . 
A standard  battery  of neuropsychological  tests was administered  to 
participants  on a separate  day prior to the experimental  session.  See 
Horne et al. (2021) for details.  
2.2. Materials  
Experimental  stimuli consisted  of 320 semantically  unrelated  word 
pairs. The pairs were randomly  divided  into ﬁve lists, which were coun- 
terbalanced  across participants  such that each pair provided  items for 
each category  of test pair (see below).  For the study phase, critical stim- 
uli were word pairs from four of the lists. For the test phase, critical 
stimuli consisted  of 192 intact pairs (words presented  together  at study), 
64 rearranged  pairs (words paired with diﬀerent  words at study), and 
64 new pairs (words not presented  at study). The test items were inter- 
mixed with 104 null trials. At both study and test the diﬀerent  categories  
of word pairs were pseudo-randomized  so that no more than three pairs 
from the same category  occurred  successively.  Two buﬀer pairs were in- 
serted at the beginning  and the middle of all experimental  task blocks. 
A randomly  determined  sequence  of low (400 Hz) and high (900 Hz) 
frequency  auditory  tones were presented  concurrently  with each test 
list. Tones were presented  with a stimulus  onset asynchrony  (SOA) rang- 
ing between  1000 and 3000 ms such that one to three tones occurred  
during each trial. To avoid the possibility  of cross-modal  perceptual  in- 
terference,  tone onsets did not occur concurrently  with the red ﬁxation  
cross presented  immediately  prior to each word pair, nor during the ﬁrst 
500 ms of each word pair presentation.  ‘Target’  and ‘non-target’  tones 
(see below) were presented  in a 30:70 ratio. The frequency  of the target 
tones (high or low) was counterbalanced  across participants.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118836,"2. Previous  approaches  using DCM 
Dynamic  Causal Modeling  (DCM) also incorporates  the temporal  
evolution  of brain activity  and thus can consider  the propagation  of 
neural activity  through  brain networks.  Each DCM contains  an eﬀective  
connectivity  matrix and a set of extrinsic  inputs that describe  how task 
events impinge  upon each node of the network  ( Friston et al., 2003 ). 
Many implementations  also contain  region-speciﬁc  hemodynamic  mod- 
2  M.F. Singh, A. Wang, M. Cole et al. NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118836 
els and/or an interaction  between  task events and eﬀective  connectiv-  
ity (i.e., the eﬀective  connectivity  is parameterized  by task events).  Al- 
though the original  DCM models were strongly  limited in size, mod- 
ern implementations  ( Frässle et al., 2017; Razi et al., 2017 ) can con- 
sider a much larger number  of brain regions  (although  the computation  
cost still remains  considerable;  Razi et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2020b ). 
However,  the DCM methodology  also presents  several constraints  which 
limit its application.  Estimating  a DCM model requires  pre-specifying  
the time-series  of task eﬀects. This assumption  precludes  analyses  which 
explore  the temporal  dynamics  of task eﬀects such as Finite Impulse  
Response  (FIR) modeling  or nuanced  task GLMs, such as those featur- 
ing nuisance  regressors  (e.g. motion).  In addition,  all DCM implemen-  
tations that support  whole-brain  models (i.e., more than a few regions;  
Razi et al., 2017 ) are dependent  upon the assumption  of stationary  lin- 
ear dynamics  ( Singh et al., 2020b ).

Fig. 1. Schematic  modelling  of assumptions:  
(A) Mendelian  randomisation  framework,  
where an instrumental  variable  ( 𝑍) inﬂuences  
only the exposure  ( 𝑋), allowing  inference  
on causal inﬂuence  of exposure  on outcome  
( 𝑌 ) even in the presence  of confounds  ( 𝑈); 
the causal eﬀect of interest is indicated  by 
the dashed arrow and 𝛽denotes the causal 
eﬀect estimate.  (B) Instrumental  variable  
assumptions:  (1) The relevance  assumption,  
that the IV is associated  with the exposure;  (2) 
the independence  assumption,  that there are no unmeasured  confounds  of IV and outcome;  and (3) the exclusion  restriction,  that the IV is only associated  with the 
outcome  via the exposure.  
(for example,  via colliders,  see Section  2.4 . Hence, there is an urgent 
need for methods  like Mendelian  randomisation  to go beyond  descrip-  
tive accounts  of associations  and establish  true causal relationships  that 
are not the result of hidden confounding.  At the same time, rigorous  
assessment  and careful interpretation  of ﬁndings  from MR studies –as 
well as any other causal claims –are essential  in order to draw plausible  
and valid scientiﬁc  conclusions  from these analyses.  
For the last 20 years, Mendelian  randomisation  has mostly been ap- 
plied to epidemiological  settings.  With the increasing  availability  of 
genetic  data from genome-wide  association  studies (GWAS),  the ﬁrst 
preprints  and papers using MR on neuroimaging  data are now being 
published.  Several  recent studies have investigated  causal links be- 
tween imaging-derived  phenotypes  (IDPs) and various  disease  patholo-  
gies such as Alzheimer’s  disease  ( Fani et al., 2021; Garﬁeld  et al., 2020; 
Knutson  et al., 2020; Korologou-Linden  et al., 2020; 2021; Wu et al., 
2021 ), heart disease  ( Tian et al., 2021 ), depression  ( Shen et al., 2020 ), 
schizophrenia  ( Stauﬀer  et al., 2021 ), other psychiatric  disorders  ( Guo 
et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021 ) and lifestyle  factors such as smoking  and 
alcohol  consumption  ( Logtenberg  et al., 2021 ). 
The purpose  of this work is to provide  an introduction  to causal infer- 
ence using methods  based on Mendelian  randomisation,  with examples  
and background  to make these methods  accessible  to a neuroimaging  re- 
searcher.  We ﬁrst motivate  the use of MR techniques,  lay out the under- 
lying assumptions,  introduce  common  MR methods  and give a detailed  
account  of important  steps to increase  the reliability  of MR results with 
a rigorous  sensitivity  analysis.  Brief sections  cover commonalities  and 
diﬀerences  with two other causal inference  methods,  mediation  analysis  
and Bayesian  networks,  and how they could be used in conjunction  with 
MR. The next section discusses  several scenarios  in which modelling  as- 
sumptions  are potentially  violated  resulting  in biased eﬀect estimates.  
In the second part, we consider  three examples  focusing  on the ap- 
plication  of MR to neuroimaging  data; speciﬁcally,  causal relationships  
of systolic  blood pressure,  bone mineral  density,  and a cognitive  trait 
with a wide range of IDPs in UK Biobank.  
Going forward,  we refer to traits, phenotypes  and any other (risk) 
factors that are considered  a potential  cause or origin of an eﬀect as 
“exposures.  ” Analogously,  any traits, phenotypes  or other factors that 
are potentially  causally  aﬀected  by an exposure  are referred  to as “out- 
comes. ”
2. Methods  
2.1. Mendelian  randomisation  
We ﬁrst give a review of Mendelian  randomisation  before intro- 
ducing other related methods  that attempt  to make causal inferences,  
namely  mediation  analysis  and Bayesian  Networks.  The use of MR has 
grown steadily,  due in part to greater availability  of large-scale  GWAS. 
In the following,  we provide  a high-level  introduction  to MR. For a de- 
tailed study we recommend  recent reviews  ( Bowden  and Holmes,  2019; 
Lawlor et al., 2019; Sanderson  et al., 2022; Tin and Köttgen,  2021 ) and 
the comprehensive  textbook  by Burgess  and Thompson  (2015a)  . Mendelian  randomisation  is based on the principle  of using genetic  
variants  as “instrumental  variables  ”( s e e Fig. 1 ) to investigate  causal 
relationships  in observational  data ( Davey Smith and Ebrahim,  2003; 
2004 ). Instrumental  variable  analysis  is an established  methodology  in 
the ﬁelds of econometrics,  statistics  and epidemiology  ( Lawlor et al., 
2008 ). In addition  to exposure  and outcome,  an instrument  is a third 
variable  that inﬂuences  the outcome  exclusively  via its eﬀect on the 
exposure.  Schematically,  in the causal chain 𝑍 →𝑋 →𝑌 , the variable  
𝑍is an instrument  for the 𝑋 − 𝑌 relationship.  
For example,  consider  the question  of impact of alcohol  consump-  
tion on liver health. There are many other factors that can inﬂuence  
both the level of alcohol  intake and risk for liver disease,  such as gen- 
eral health, diet, exercise  and level of education.  Additionally,  it could 
be the case that liver disease  aﬀects alcohol  intake. The availability  of 
alcoholic  beverages  (across diﬀerent  countries  or due to diﬀerent  levels 
of taxation),  however,  provides  an instrumental  variable  that inﬂuences  
the chances  of an individual  consuming  alcohol  but has no direct eﬀect 
on liver health. Therefore,  observational  data on alcohol  consumption  
as predicted  by availability  can be associated  with measures  of liver 
health to obtain a less confounded  estimate  of the eﬀect of alcohol  on 
the liver. 2 As in most scenarios,  there are caveats  and limitations  to con- 
sider in this example.  For instance,  socio-economic  variables  will play a 
non-trivial  role for health outcomes,  levels of alcohol  consumption  and 
impact of taxation.  Careful  consideration  of potential  biases and validity  
of assumptions  is therefore  necessary.  
In the remainder  of this work, we will use the following  example  
concerning  the eﬀect of blood pressure  on cardiovascular  health: A cor- 
relation  between  higher blood pressure  and coronary  heart disease  does 
not prove a causal eﬀect of one on the other, since common  causes (BMI 
for instance)  may inﬂuence  both blood pressure  levels and risk of heart 
disease.  The inclusion  of a new, instrumental  variable,  that is causally  
linked to blood pressure  (for example,  a speciﬁc  genetic  variant),  but has 
no direct inﬂuence  on the outcome,  allows one to separate  true causal 
eﬀects of blood pressure  on heart disease  from spurious  correlations  due 
to BMI and other confounds.  
In MR, the validity  of the instrumental  variables  rests on the laws 
of Mendelian  inheritance,  in particular  the principle  of random  assort- 
ment of parent alleles during meiosis.  The fact that the composition  of 
the genetic  code is ﬁxed at conception  precludes  any environmental  in- 
ﬂuences  or eﬀects of lifestyle  factors.  This means that genetic  variants  
are (mostly)  unaﬀected  by issues of confounding  and reverse  causation.  
In other words, comparing  groups of individuals  with a diﬀerent  genetic  
makeup  at speciﬁc  locations  of the genome  (e.g., single-nucleotide  poly- 
morphisms  or SNPs) provides  a chance to detect a causal eﬀect between  
genetically-determined  levels of the exposure  and an outcome  of inter- 
est, without  many of the limitations  in other observational  studies that 
are due to confounding  eﬀects 3 MR examines  the observed  association  
between  outcome  and genotype-predicted  exposure.  Because  of the in-

exposures  outside the control of the investigator  are also known as “natural  
experiments  ”.

mutability  of an individual’s  genotype,  any robustly  identiﬁed  eﬀect can 
be directly  attributed  to the exposure.  
It should be noted that, although  largely valid, there exist some 
caveats  to the assumption  of a fully random  distribution  of genetic  vari- 
ants among the population  (see also Section  2.4 ). For a thorough  discus- 
sion of the “MR-as-nature’s-randomised-controlled-trial  ”analogy  and its 
limitations,  see Swanson  et al. (2017) . 
2.1.1. Instrumental  variables  
For any instrumental  variable  (IV) analysis,  there are three main as- 
sumptions  that a candidate  IV must satisfy to be a valid IV ( Burgess  
and Thompson,  2015a; Haycock  et al., 2016 ): 1) The IV is associated  
with the exposure  (relevance  assumption);  2) There are no unmeasured  
confounders  of the association  between  IV and outcome  (independence  
assumption);  3) The IV is only associated  with the outcome  via the ex- 
posure (exclusion  restriction).  A schematic  summary  of the standard  MR 
setup and the three IV assumptions  is depicted  in the causal diagrams  
in Fig. 1 . 
As an illustrative  example,  consider  the SNP rs35479618,  which 
has been found to be strongly  associated  with systolic  blood pressure  
( Liu et al., 2016 ). In a uni-variable  analysis,  this single SNP is the in- 
strument  ( 𝑍), systolic  blood pressure  (BP) is the exposure  ( 𝑋) and coro- 
nary artery disease  (CAD) is the outcome  ( 𝑌 ). Absent any direct as- 
sociations  of the SNP with confounds  and the outcome,  the simplest  
MR estimate  for the causal eﬀect of BP on CAD is given by the ratio 
of the SNP–outcome  association  to the SNP–exposure  association.  Con- 
cretely,  using GWAS data on BP (GWAS  ID: ukb-b-20175  ( Mitchell  et al., 
2019 )) and CAD (GWAS  ID: ebi-a-GCST005195  ( Van Der Harst and Ver- 
weij, 2018 )), both accessed  via the MRC IEU OpenGWAS  data infras- 
tructure  ( Elsworth  et al., 2020 ), the SNP–BP  association  is 0.0617 (i.e., 
0.0617 SD change in BP associated  with change in SNP dosage)  and 
the SNP–CAD  association  is 0.0652 (odds ratio change associated  with 
change in SNP dosage).  The causal eﬀect of BP on coronary  artery dis- 
ease is therefore  𝛽= 0 . 0652∕0 . 0617 = 1 . 06 . Since CAD is a binary variable,  
the eﬀect estimate  is given as a log odds ratio of CAD occurring  for a 
one-standard-deviation  increase  in BP. In binary case–control  scenarios,  
log-linear  or logistic  regression  models are often preferred,  where the 
eﬀect estimate  then corresponds  to the log relative  risk or log-odds  ra- 
tio, respectively  ( Burgess  et al., 2017b ). However,  due to small eﬀects 
of SNPs, linear models generally  approximate  logistic  models well and 
are therefore  widely used in MR analyses.  
By inference  methods  we describe  below, a p-value  can be computed,  
here p = 0.017; although  nominally  signiﬁcant,  the 95% conﬁdence  in- 
terval for the eﬀect estimate  (95% CI [0 . 19 , 1 . 94] ) is very large. Multi- 
variable  analyses  that simultaneously  use many SNPs as instrumental  
variables  generally  have higher power to detect an eﬀect and allow for 
the application  of more advanced  MR methods  as well as sensitivity  
analyses.  
Crucially,  the validity  of the instrumental  variable  assumptions  is a 
necessary  prerequisite  for the causal interpretation  of Mendelian  ran- 
domisation  results.  In practice,  a potential  violation  of the second and 
third assumption  can often not be ruled out and causal conclusions  need 
to be drawn carefully.  However,  there are an increasing  number  of sen- 
sitivity analyses  as well as robust MR methods  available  that can aid 
in the identiﬁcation  of bias, and support  tentative  causal claims (see 
Section  2.1.5 ). 
2.1.2. Individual-  vs. summary-level  data 
MR can be performed  using individual  subject-level  data or sum- 
mary statistics  from large-scale  genome-wide  association  studies (i.e., 
3 Although  the vast majority  of MR studies uses SNPs as instrumental  vari- 
ables, other genetic variants  such as indels and genetic variants  associated  with 
diﬀerent  gene expression  or protein levels (eQTLs, pQTLs) can be used as instru- 
ments. For simplicity,  we only refer to SNPs in this work. regression  coeﬃcients  and standard  errors of the SNP–phenotype  asso- 
ciations).  Although,  conceptually,  the two approaches  are equivalent,  
in practice,  each has its own beneﬁts  and drawbacks.  Individual-level  
MR allows one to test and adjust for suspected  SNP–confounder  asso- 
ciations  and to perform  subgroup  analyses,  but usually  has lower sta- 
tistical power to detect causal eﬀects due to smaller  sample sizes. Sum- 
mary statistics  from international  GWAS consortia  on the other hand are 
readily available  and often based on very large sample sizes, and are 
commonly  used in so-called  two-sample  MR, where the SNP–exposure  
and SNP–outcome  associations  are estimated  on two separate  datasets  
( Burgess  et al., 2015 ). Individual-level  data is often used in one-sample  
MR, which is more prone to overﬁtting  due to weak instrument  bias 
(see Section  2.4 ). One-sample  settings  have the potential  beneﬁt that 
MR results can be linked to other analyses  involving  the same indi- 
viduals,  whereas  two-sample  analyses  would be problematic  if the two 
data sets diﬀer substantially  in their population  characteristics  (ethnic-  
ity, sex, age, socio-economic  status, etc.) ( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). 
Because  of potential  bias due to sample overlap  and weak instru- 
ments, two-sample  MR is commonly  preferred  in practice.  However,  the 
two datasets  in two-sample  MR must represent  the same population,  and 
summary  eﬀect estimates  need to be harmonised  across the two datasets.  
Some specialised  MR approaches  are only available  for individual-  
level data, such as factorial  MR to assess interactions  ( Rees et al., 
2020 ) and non-linear  MR ( Silverwood  et al., 2014; Staley and Burgess,  
2017 ). Recent advances  in methodology  continue  to expand  the avail- 
ability of MR variants  to summary-level  data, for example,  methods  for 
identifying  violations  of the exclusion  restriction,  known as horizontal  
pleiotropy,  via gene-by-environment  interactions  ( Spiller et al., 2019 ). 
For the remainder  of this paper, we will focus on summary-level  MR 
methods  since these are i) more common,  ii) easier to carry out, and iii) 
as far as neuroimaging  phenotypes  are concerned,  summary  statistics  
from population  studies such as UK Biobank  are essentially  the only 
available  data with large enough  sample sizes (ideally,  𝑁 ≫10 4 ).

EEG, but they should also do so in a way that is interpretable.  For in- 
stance, if noise is easily identiﬁable,  corrective  action can be quickly  
taken by experimenters  or users during a recording.  
It is important  to consider  that not all sources  of noise aﬀect EEG 
recordings  in the same way ( Hari and Puce, 2017 ). Physiological  arti- 
facts are large electrical  signals that are generated  by current  sources  
outside  the brain such as heart activity,  eye or tongue movement,  mus- 
cle contraction,  sweating,  etc. Depending  on the EEG electrode  montage  
and the setting of the recording  ( e.g., eyes open or closed),  these artifacts  
can be more or less disruptive  to measuring  the brain activity  of interest.  
Movement  artifacts,  on the other hand, are caused by the relative  dis- 
placement  of EEG electrodes  with respect to the scalp, and can introduce  
noise of varying  spectral  content  in the aﬀected  electrodes  during move- 
ment. If an electrode  cannot properly  connect  with the skin ( e.g., after 
a movement  artifact  or because  it was not correctly  set up initially),  its 
reading  will likely contain  little or no physiological  information  and in- 
stead pick up instrumentation  and environmental  noise. These are com- 
monly referred  to as “bad ”or “missing  ”channels  in the literature.  In the 
context  of this work, we refer to them as “corrupted  channels  ”to explic- 
itly include  the case where a signal corruption  mechanism  ( e.g., active 
noise sources  in uncontrolled  environments)  must be accounted  for by 
predictive  models.  While channel  corruption  aﬀects EEG recordings  in 
all contexts,  it is more likely in real-world  mobile EEG recordings  than 
in controlled  laboratory  settings  where trained  experimenters  can mon- 
itor and remedy  bad electrodes  during the recording.  Therefore,  special 
care must be given to the problem  of channel  corruption  in sparse mo- 
bile EEG settings.  
In this paper, we propose  and benchmark  an attention  mechanism  
module  designed  to handle corrupted  channel  data, based on the con- 
cept of “scaling  attention  ”( Hu et al., 2018; Woo et al., 2018 ). This 
module  can be inserted  before the ﬁrst layer of any convolutional  neu- 
ral network  architecture  in which activations  have a spatial dimension  
( Chambon  et al., 2018; Lawhern  et al., 2018; Schirrmeister  et al., 2017 ), 
and then be trained  end-to-end  for the prediction  task at hand. The rest of the paper is structured  as follows.  Section  2 presents  an 
overview  of the EEG noise handling  literature,  then describes  the atten- 
tion module  and denoising  procedure  proposed  in this study. The neural 
architectures,  baseline  methods  and data used in our experiments  are 
introduced  in Section  3 . Next, Section  4 reports the results of our exper- 
iments on sleep and pathology  EEG datasets.  Lastly, we examine  related 
work and discuss the results in Section  5 . 
2. Methods  
2.1. State-of-the-art  approaches  to noise-robust  EEG processing  
Existing  strategies  for dealing  with noisy data can be divided  into 
three categories  ( Table 1 ): (1) ignoring  or rejecting  noisy segments,  
(2) implicit  denoising,  i.e. , methods  that allow models to work despite 
noise, and (3) explicit  denoising,  i.e. , methods  that rely on a separate  
preprocessing  step to handle noise or missing  channels  before predic- 
tion. We now discuss existing  methods  employing  these strategies  in 
more detail. 
The simplest  way to deal with noise in EEG is to assume  that it is 
negligible  or to simply discard  bad segments  ( Roy et al., 2019 ). For 
instance,  a manually  selected  amplitude  or variance  threshold  ( Hefron 
et al., 2018; Manor and Geva, 2015; Wang et al., 2018 ) or a classiﬁer  
trained  to recognize  artifacts  ( Dhindsa,  2017 ) can be used to identify  
segments  to be ignored.  This approach,  though commonplace,  is ill- 
suited to mobile EEG settings  where noise cannot be assumed  to be neg- 
ligible, but also to online applications  where model predictions  need to 
be continuously  available.  Moreover,  this approach  is likely to discard  
windows  due to a small fraction  of bad electrodes,  potentially  losing 
usable information  from other channels.  
Implicit  denoising  approaches  can be used to design noise-robust  
processing  pipelines  that do not contain  a speciﬁc  noise handling  step. 
First, implicit  denoising  approaches  can use representations  of EEG data 
that are robust to missing  channels.  For instance,  multichannel  EEG can 
be transformed  into topographical  maps ( “topomaps  ”) that are less sen- 
2  H. Banville, S.U.N. Wood, C. Aimone et al. NeuroImage  251 (2022) 118994 
sitive to the absence  of a few channels.  This representation  is then typ- 
ically fed into a standard  convolutional  neural network  (ConvNet)  ar- 
chitecture.  While this approach  can gracefully  handle missing  channels  
in dense montages  ( e.g., 16 to 64 channels  in Bashivan  et al., 2015; Ha- 
gad et al., 2019; Thodoroﬀ et  al., 2016 ), it is likely to perform  poorly 
on sparse montages  ( e.g., 4 channels)  as spatial interpolation  might 
fail if channels  are missing.  Moreover,  this approach  requires  compu-  
tationally  demanding  preprocessing  and feature extraction  steps, un- 
desirable  in online and low-computational  resources  contexts.  In the 
traditional  machine  learning  setting,  Sabbagh  et al. (2020) showed  
that representing  input windows  as covariance  matrices  and using Rie- 
mannian  geometry-aware  models did not require  common  noise cor- 
rection steps to reach high performance  on a brain age prediction  
task. However,  the robustness  of this approach  has not been evalu- 
ated on sparse montages.  Also, its integration  into neural network  ar- 
chitectures  is not straightforward  with geometry-aware  deep learning  
remaining  an active ﬁeld of research  ( Bronstein  et al., 2017 ). Signal 
processing  techniques  can also be used to promote  invariance  to cer- 
tain types of noise. For instance,  the Lomb-Scargle  periodogram  can be 
used to extract spectral  representations  that are robust to missing  sam- 
ples ( Chu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015 ). However,  this approach  fails 
when channels  are completely  missing.  Finally,  implicit  denoising  can 
be achieved  with traditional  machine  learning  models that are inher- 
ently robust to noise. For instance,  random  forests trained  on hand- 
crafted EEG features  were shown to be notably  more robust to low 
SNR inputs than univariate  models on a state-of-consciousness  predic- 
tion task ( Engemann  et al., 2018 ). Although  promising,  this approach  is 
limited by its feature engineering  step, as features  (1) rely heavily  on do- 
main knowledge,  (2) might not be optimal  to the task, and (3) require  an 
additional  processing  step which can be prohibitive  in limited resource  
contexts.  
Multiple  studies have explicitly  handled  noise by correcting  cor- 
rupted signals or predicting  missing  or additional  channels  from avail- 
able ones. Spatial projection  approaches  aim at projecting  the input 
signals to a noise-free  subspace  before projecting  the signals back into 
channel-space,  e.g., using independent  component  analysis  (ICA) ( Jung 
et al., 1998; Mammone  et al., 2011; Winkler  et al., 2011 ) or princi- 
pal components  analysis  (PCA) ( Kothe and Jung, 2016; Uusitalo  and 
Ilmoniemi,  1997 ). While approaches  such as ICA are powerful  tools 
to mitigate  artifact  and noise components  in a semi-automated  way, 
their eﬃcacy  can diminish  when only few channels  are available.  For 
instance,  in addition  to introducing  an additional  preprocessing  step, 
these approaches  are likely to discard  important  discriminative  informa-  
tion during preprocessing  because  they are decoupled  from the predic- 
tion task. Also, the fact that preprocessing  is done independently  from 
the supervised  learning  task, or the statistical  testing procedure,  actu- 
ally makes the selection  of preprocessing  parameters  ( e.g., number  of 
good components)  challenging.  Motivated  by the challenge  of parame-  
ter selection,  fully automated  denoising  pipelines  have been proposed.  
FASTER  ( Nolan et al., 2010 ) and PREP ( Bigdely-Shamlo  et al., 2015 ) 
both combine  artifact  correction,  noise removal  and bad channel  inter- 
polation  into a single automated  pipeline.  Autoreject  ( Jas et al., 2017 ) 
is another  recently  developed  pipeline  that uses cross-validation  to au- 
tomatically  select amplitude  thresholds  to use for rejecting  windows  or 
ﬂagging  bad channels.  These approaches  are well-suited  to oﬄine anal- 
yses where the morphology  of the signals is of interest,  however  they are 
typically  computationally  demanding  and are also decoupled  from the 
statistical  modeling.  Additionally,  it is unclear  how interpolation  can be 
applied  when using bipolar  montages  ( i.e. , that do not share a single 
reference),  as is often the case in e.g., polysomnography  ( Berry et al., 
2012 ) and epilepsy  monitoring  ( Rosenzweig  et al., 2014 ). 
Finally,  generic  machine  learning  models have been proposed  to 
recover  bad channels.  For instance,  generative  adversarial  networks  
(GANs)  have been trained  to recover  dense EEG montages  from a few 
electrodes  ( Corley and Huang,  2018; Svantesson  et al., 2020 ). Other sim- 
ilar methods  have been proposed,  e.g., long short-term  memory  (LSTM)  neural networks  ( Paul, 2020 ), autoencoders  ( El-Fiqi et al., 2019 ), or ten- 
sor decomposition  and compressed  sensing  ( Ramakrishnan  and Satya- 
narayana,  2016; Sole-Casals  et al., 2018 ). However,  these methods  pos- 
tulate that the identity  of bad channels  is known ahead of time, which 
is a non-trivial  assumption  in practice.  
In contrast  to the existing  literature  on channel  corruption  handling  
in EEG, we introduce  an interpretable  end-to-end  denoising  approach  
that can learn implicitly  to work with corrupted  sparse EEG data, and 
that does not require  additional  preprocessing  steps. 
2.2. Dynamic  spatial ﬁltering:  Second-order  attention  for learning  on noisy 
EEG signals 
The key goal behind dynamic  spatial ﬁltering  (DSF) is to help neural 
networks  focus on the most important  channels,  at each time instant,  
given a speciﬁc  machine  learning  task on EEG. To do so, we introduce  
a spatial attention  mechanism  that dynamically  reweights  channels  ac- 
cording  to their predictive  power. This idea is inspired  by recent de- 
velopments  in attention  mechanisms,  most speciﬁcally  the “scaling  at- 
tention  ” approach  proposed  in computer  vision ( Hu et al., 2018; Woo 
et al., 2018 ). Notably,  DSF leverages  second-order  information,  i.e. , spa- 
tial covariance,  to capture  dependencies  between  EEG channels.  In this 
section,  we detail the learning  problem  under study, the proposed  atten- 
tion architecture  and a data augmentation  transform  designed  to help 
train noise-robust  models.  
Notation  We denote by /llbracket 𝑞/rrbracket the set {1 , …, 𝑞} . The index 𝑡 refers to 
time indices in the multivariate  time series 𝑆 ∈ℝ 𝐶×𝑀 , where 𝑀is the 
number  of time samples  and 𝐶is the number  of EEG channels.  𝑆is 
further divided  into non-overlapping  windows  𝑋 ∈ℝ 𝐶×𝑇 where 𝑇 is the 
number  of time samples  in the window.  We denote by 𝑦 ∈the target 
used in the learning  task. Typically,  is /llbracket 𝐿 /rrbracket for a classiﬁcation  problem  
with 𝐿 classes.  
We perform  experiments  in the supervised  classiﬁcation  setting.  A 
model 𝑓 Θ∶  →with parameters  Θ( e.g., a convolutional  neural net- 
work) is trained  to predict the class 𝑦 of EEG windows  𝑋. For this, we 
train 𝑓 Θto minimize  the loss  , e.g., the categorical  cross-entropy  loss, 
over the example-label  pairs ( 𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) : 
̂𝑓 Θ= arg min 
Θ𝔼 𝑋 𝑖 ,𝑦 𝑖 ∈× [  ( 𝑓 Θ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) , 𝑦 𝑖 )] . (1) 
In particular,  we are interested  in the performance  of 𝑓 Θwhen ran- 
dom channels  are corrupted  and more speciﬁcally  when channel  corrup-  
tion occurs at test time ( i.e. , when training  data is mostly clean). Toward  
this goal, we insert an attention-based  module  𝑚 DSF ∶ ℝ 𝐶×𝑇 →ℝ 𝐶 ′×𝑇 
into 𝑓 Θwhich performs  a (ﬁxed) transformation  Φ( 𝑋) to extract rele- 
vant spatial information  from 𝑋, followed  by a reweighting  mechanism  
for the input signals.  
In order to implicitly  handle noise in neural network  architectures,  
we design an attention  module  where second-order  information  is ex- 
tracted from the input and used to predict weights  of a linear transfor-  
mation of the input EEG channels,  that are optimized  for the learning  
task ( Fig. 1 ). Applying  such linear transforms  to multivariate  EEG signals 
is commonly  referred  to as “spatial  ﬁltering  ”, a technique  that has been 
widely used in the ﬁeld of EEG ( Blankertz  et al., 2007; de Cheveigné
and Simon, 2008; Lotte and Guan, 2010; Makeig  et al., 1996; McFar- 
land et al., 1997; Nikulin  et al., 2011; Parra et al., 2005 ). This enables  
the model to learn to ignore noisy outputs  and/or to reweight  them, 
while still leveraging  any remaining  spatial information.  We now show 
how this module  can be applied  to the raw input 𝑋. 
We deﬁne the dynamic  spatial ﬁlter (DSF) module  𝑚 DSF as: 
𝑚 DSF ( 𝑋) = 𝑊 DSF ( 𝑋 ) 𝑋 + 𝑏 DSF ( 𝑋 ) , (2) 
where 𝑊 DSF ∈ℝ 𝐶 ′×𝐶 and 𝑏 DSF ∈ℝ 𝐶 ′are obtained  by reshaping  the 
output of a neural network,  e.g., a multilayer  perceptron  (MLP), 
ℎ Θ𝐷𝑆𝐹 (Φ( 𝑋)) ∈ℝ 𝐶 ′×( 𝐶+1) (see Fig. 1 ). Under this formulation,  each row 
in 𝑊 DSF corresponds  to a spatial ﬁlter that linearly  transforms  the input 
signals into another  virtual channel.  Here, 𝐶 ′can be set to the number  of

Fig. 1. Visual description  of the Dynamic  Spatial Filtering  (DSF) attention  module.  An input window  𝐗 with 𝐶spatial channels  is processed  by a 2-layer MLP to

and focus on the most informative  ones. 
input spatial channels  𝐶or considered  a hyperparameter  of the attention  
module.  2 When 𝐶 ′= 𝐶, if the diagonal  of 𝑊 DSF is 0, 𝑊 DSF corresponds  
to a linear interpolation  of each channel  based on the 𝐶 − 1 others, as is 
commonly  done in the classical  EEG literature  ( Perrin et al., 1989 ) (see 
Supplemental  Appendix  F for an in-depth  discussion).  Heavily  corrupted  
channels  can be ignored  by giving them a weight of 0 in 𝑊 DSF . To facili- 
tate this behavior,  we can further apply a soft-thresholding  element-wise  
nonlinearity  to 𝑊 DSF : 
𝑊 ′
DSF = sign ( 𝑊 DSF ) max ( ||𝑊 DSF ||− 𝜏, 0) , (3) 
where 𝜏is a threshold  empirically  set to 0.1, |⋅|is the element-wise  
absolute  value and both the sign and max operators  are applied  element-  
wise. 
In our experiments,  the spatial information  extracted  by the trans- 
forms Φ( 𝑋) was either (1) the log-variance  of each input channel  or 
(2) the ﬂattened  upper triangular  part of the matrix logarithm  of the 
covariance  matrix of 𝑋(see Supplemental  Appendix  A). 3 When report- 
ing results,  we denote models as DSFd and DSFm when DSF takes the 
log-variance  or the matrix logarithm  of the covariance  matrix as input, 
respectively.  We further add the suﬃx “-st ”t o indicate  the use of the 
soft-thresholding  nonlinearity,  e.g., DSFm-st  . 
Interestingly,  the DSF module  can be seen as a multi-head  attention  
mechanism  ( Vaswani  et al., 2017 ) with real-valued  attention  weights  
and where each head is tasked with producing  a linear combination  of 
the input spatial signals.  
Finally,  we can inspect the attention  given by 𝑚 DSF to each input 
channel  by computing  the “eﬀective  channel  importance  ”metric  4 𝝓∈
ℝ 𝐶 where 
𝜙𝑗 = √ √ √ √ 𝐶 ′∑
𝑖 =1 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 2 . (4) 
2 In which case it can be used to increase  the diversity  of input channels  in 
models trained on sparse montages  ( 𝐶 ′> 𝐶) or perform  dimensionality  reduc- 
tion to reduce computational  complexity  ( 𝐶 ′< 𝐶). 
3 In practice,  if a channel is “ﬂat-lining  ” (has only 0s) inside a window  and 
therefore  has a variance  of 0, its log-variance  is replaced  by 0. Similarly,  if a 
covariance  matrix eigenvalue  is 0 when computing  the matrix logarithm  (see 
Supplemental  Appendix  A), its logarithm  is replaced  by 0. 
4 “Eﬀective  channel importance  ” measures  how useful the actual data of a 
channel is. It is not to be confused  with the theoretical  importance  of a channel,  
i.e. , the fact that in theory some channels  (given good signal quality) might be 
more useful for some tasks than other channels.  Therefore,  in this work, when 
we measure  or discuss the “importance  ”o f a channel,  we refer to the useful- 
ness of the actual signal collected  with that channel with respect to the task. 
For instance,  a corrupted  channel will likely have low “importance  ”, although  
the neurophysiological  information  available  at that location  would be useful 
should the channel not be corrupted.  The use of the word importance  in the 
present context is in line with the literature  in statistical  machine  learning  re- 
ferring to “feature  importance  ”a s quantiﬁed  for example  using “permutation  
importance  ”( Breiman,  2001 ). Intuitively,  𝝓measures  how much each input channel  is used by 𝑚 DSF 
to produce  the output virtual channels.  A normalized  version  
̂𝝓= 𝝓
max 𝑖 𝝓𝑖 (5) 
can also be used to obtain a value between  0 and 1. This straightfor-  
ward way of inspecting  the functioning  of the DSF module  facilitates  
the identiﬁcation  of important  or noisy channels.  
To further help our models learn to be robust to noise, we design a 
data augmentation  procedure  that randomly  corrupts  channels.  Speciﬁ-  
cally, channel  corruption  is simulated  by performing  a masked  channel-  
wise convex combination  of input channels  and Gaussian  white noise 
𝑍 ∈ℝ 𝐶×𝑇 : 
̃𝑋 = (1 − 𝜂) diag ( 𝝂) 𝑋 + 𝜂diag ( 𝝂) 𝑍 + diag (1 − 𝝂) 𝑋, (6) 
where 𝑍 𝑖,𝑗 ∼ (0 , 𝜎2 
𝑛 ) for 𝑖 ∈/llbracket 𝑇 /rrbracket and 𝑗 ∈/llbracket 𝐶/rrbracket , 𝜂∈[ 0 , 1] controls  the rel- 
ative strength  of the noise, and 𝝂∈{ 0 , 1} 𝐶 is a masking  vector that con- 
trols which channels  are corrupted.  The operator  diag ( 𝑥 ) creates a square 
matrix ﬁlled with zeros whose diagonal  is the vector 𝑥 . Here, 𝝂is sam- 
pled from a multinouilli  distribution  with parameter  𝑝 . Each window  𝑋

of its tripartite  organization,  or if all three parts of the IPC contribute  to 
cognitive  control,  they might not have the same activity  and functional  
connectivity  patterns.  
As part of our comprehensive  project to map the functional  connec-  
tivity patterns  of the IPC clusters,  we have already  reported  the involve-  
ment of the rostral IPC in cognitive  control of language  and have high- 
lighted that even cognitive  demand  modulates  connectivity  patterns  of 
this part of the cortex ( Tabassi  Mofrad  and Schiller,  2020 ). In mapping  
the connectivity  patterns  of the caudal IPC, we followed  an exploratory  
approach  since to our knowledge  there are no previous  studies in which 
functional  connectivity  patterns  of the caudal IPC in task performance  
are addressed,  based on which one could form a hypothesis  in the con- 
text of the related literature.  
Regarding  the activation  (but not the connectivity  patterns)  of the 
angular  gyrus, Wu et al. (2009) reported  that this part of the cortex was 
strongly  deactivated  in performing  the mental arithmetic  tasks with Ara- 
bic and Roman numerals.  The angular  gyrus which is subdivided  into 
the two subregions,  namely,  PGa and PGp is identical  to the caudal IPC 
when using correlated  transmitter  receptor-based  organization  of the 
IPC ( Caspers  et al., 2006 , 2008 & 2013). In some other studies the angu- 
lar gyrus is implicated  in numerous  tasks and processes  (for a review see 
Seghier,  2013 ; Ramanan  and Bellana  2019 ). The IPC is also questionably  
considered  part of the resting state network  e.g. Shehzad  et al. (2009) re- 
ported that the IPC is a task-deactivated  area though the involvement  
of the IPC in diﬀerent  cognitive  functions  cannot be ignored.  
As mentioned  earlier,  the inconsistencies  in reporting  the functions  
of the IPC are by far due to considering  this part of the cortex as a 
whole and attributing  functions  of diﬀerent  IPC sub-areas  to the whole 
IPC. Such contradictory  reports gave us the hint of a possibility  that the 
caudal IPC might show connectivity  patterns  diﬀerent  from what could 
be expected  from the general  behavior  of the IPC as a whole, when task 
involvement  is concerned.  
In this project,  we beneﬁted  from the multiband  EPI technique  
(multiband  factor = 4) with one of the quickest  repetition  time 
(TR = 690 ms) in image acquisition,  resulting  in increasing  the sen- 
sitivity in mapping  brain functional  connectivity  ( Liao et al., 2013 ; 
Preibisch  et al., 2015 ), increasing  the temporal  and the spatial resolution  
( Chen et al., 2015 ), and increasing  the sensitivity  of BOLD acquisitions  
( Kundu et al., 2012 ). 
Methods  
Participants  
Fifty-two  students  from Leiden University  aged 18–27 years took 
part in this study. They were Dutch-English  bilinguals  with upper- 
intermediate  proﬁciency  in English,  healthy  and right-handed  with nor- 
mal or corrected-to-normal  vision. We did not use the data from seven 
participants  because  of their excessive  movements  in the scanner,  so 
the ﬁnal composition  of the participants  was 34 females  and 11 males. 
Participants  gave their written  informed  consent  before taking part in 
the experiment  and they were either remunerated  or received  course 
credits for their participation.  We received  the approval  of the medical  
ethics committee  of Leiden University  Medical  Center (LUMC)  (Leiden,  
the Netherlands)  for the protocol  of this experiment  (NL61816.058.17).  
Stimuli 
We selected  forty-eight  pictures  from the International  Picture Nam- 
ing Project (IPNP- https://crl.ucsd.edu/experiments/ipnp/)  based on 
the following  variables  in both Dutch and English:  RT (mean),  number  of 
letters and syllables,  initial fricative,  H statistics,  and word complexity  
(see Table 1 for a summary  of the variables).  
Both CELEX lexical database  as well as the IPNP database  were used 
as references  for the variables  summarized  in Table 1 . We developed  two 
parallel  sets of twenty-four  stimuli,  namely,  set A and set B, which we counterbalanced  across participants,  having considered  all the variables  
in Table 1 in addition  to visual complexity,  conceptual  complexity  and 
word frequency  (see Table 2 and Table 3 for further details).  
Procedure  
We used a language  switching  task, which requires  cognitive  control,  
with two levels of cognitive  demand  (switching  to the ﬁrst language  (L1) 
is cognitively  more demanding  than switching  to the second language  
(L2)) to map the functional  connectivity  of the caudal IPC. During the 
experiment,  participants  were required  to do a language  switching  task 
that we controlled  by the E-Prime  Software,  and they switched  between  
Dutch (L1) and English  (L2). The experiment  included  two types of trials 
in four conditions.  There were either switch trials in which the response  
language  was diﬀerent  from the preceding  trial (i.e. from Dutch to En- 
glish or English  to Dutch) or non-switch  trials in which the response  
language  remained  the same as the previous  trial (i.e. Dutch to Dutch 
or English  to English).  There were 76 trials in total and the number  of 
trials in switch and non-switch  context  were the same. The fMRI exper- 
iment included  one run of 6 min and 46 s, in an event-related  design. 
Each trial began with a visual cue for 250 ms, in the form of a red (for 
Dutch) or blue frame (for English),  which was counterbalanced  across 
participants,  and preceded  a picture to instruct  participants  which lan- 
guage to use to name the upcoming  picture.  The cue was followed  by 
a ﬁxation  cross for 500 ms and then by presentation  of a picture for 
2010 ms, the order of which was pseudo-randomized.  Each trial ended 
with a jittered  blank screen varying  between  690 and 2760 ms. 
Participants  ﬁrst underwent  a behavioral  training  before the fMRI 
data acquisition.  During the training,  participants  were familiarized  
with pictures  used in the experiment,  learned  the association  between  
the color cue and the response  language  and did a small scale of a lan- 
guage switching  task in which the target pictures  were not used. We in- 
structed  the participants  to name pictures  with minimal  jaw movement  
to avoid movement-related  artifacts.  Four weeks after the fMRI data ac- 
quisition  session,  participants  attended  the behavioral  lab and did the 
same task that they performed  inside the MRI scanner.  We collected  
their responses  by a voice key, using a SRBOX,  in line with previous  
studies (e.g. Anderson  et al., 2018 ; Grady et al., 2015 ). 
fMRI data acquisition  
We acquired  all the data on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva  TX MRI scan- 
ner (Best, The Netherlands)  in the Leiden University  Medical  Center,  
which was equipped  with a SENSE-32  channel  head coil. First, we col- 
lected the high-resolution  anatomical  images for co-registration  with the 
functional  ones, before the functional  images were acquired.  The high- 
resolution  anatomical  images included  a 3D gradient-echo  T1-weighted  
sequence  with the following  parameters:  TR = 7.9 ms, TE =",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5583, 5586), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(7547, 7550), match=' 3.'>"

Introduction  
Autism Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD) is a life-long  neurodevelopmen-  
tal disorder  which aﬀects more than 1% of the population.  Its sever- 
ity diﬀers vastly amongst  individuals,  however,  they all share per- 
sistent deﬁcits  in social communication  and restricted,  repetitive  and 
stereotyped  behaviours.  ASD is heritable,  and inﬂuenced  by common  
genetic  variation  as well as rare mutations  ( Krumm  et al., 2015 ; 
Bourgeron,  2015 ; Sandin et al., 2017 ; Weiner  et al., 2017 ). Early in- 
tervention  has a signiﬁcant  positive  impact on the patient’s  outcome,  
which makes early diagnosis  a research  priority  ( Dawson  et al., 2010 ). 
Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) is an important  tool to explore  
the brain of individuals  with ASD: it is a widely available,  fast, and non- 
invasive  method  to measure  brain anatomy  and function.  By providing  
detailed  measurements  of an individual’s  brain, MRI brings the promises  
of precision  psychiatry,  adapting  therapy  to patients  ( Insel, 2014 ). But 
can MRI be used to characterise  ASD in general?  For more than 30 years, 
MRI studies have described  anatomical  and functional  diﬀerences  be- 
tween individuals  with ASD and unaﬀected  controls:  enlarged  brain vol- 
ume and cortical  surface area ( Piven et al., 1995 ; E. Courchesne  et al., 
2001 ), decreases  in brain volume  and neocortical  thinning  during ado- 
lescence  and adulthood  ( Lange et al., 2015 ; Zielinski  et al., 2014 ), 
smaller  corpus callosum  ( Egaas et al., 1995 ; Wolﬀ et  al., 2015 ), ab- 
normal  cerebellar  volume  ( Courchesne,  1987 ; Hodge et al., 2010 ; 
Fatemi et al., 2012 ), and global and regional  increases  and decreases  in 
functional  connectivity  ( Just, 2004 ; Belmonte,  2004 ; Di Martino  et al., 
2014a ; Cheng et al., 2017 ). 
Many of these ﬁndings  are, however,  controversial  and have proven 
diﬃcult  to replicate  ( Haar et al., 2016 ; Lefebvre  et al., 2015 ; Traut et al., 
2018 ; Picci et al., 2016 ; Mohammad-Rezazadeh  et al., 2016 ). Most stud- 
ies have relied on sample sizes far too small to reach reliable  conclusions  
–sometimes  just a few dozen subjects,  and up to a few hundreds  at most. 
They lack replication  and reanalysis  on independent  data. This is par- 
ticularly  problematic  because  of the multitude  of parameters  involved  
in each analysis  which could substantially  alter the results ( Carp, 2012 ; 
Power et al., 2012 ; Poldrack  et al., 2017 ): acquisition  sequence,  subject 
motion,  software  packages,  pre-processing  workﬂow,  etc. 
Rather than focusing  on the detection  of speciﬁc  regional  diﬀerences  
between  cases and controls,  brain-imaging  features  can be combined  
into a biomarker  of ASD answering  the question:  can diagnostic  status 
be inferred  from MRI data? Machine-learning  provides  important  tech- 
niques to build and characterise  such biomarkers.  Yet, machine-learning  
studies of ASD are most often based on the analysis  of a single sample,  
without  validation  of the ﬁndings  in an independent  sample.  The com- 
munity  recognises  today that establishing  the validity  of a biomarker  
needs a fully independent  assessment  on new data, otherwise  its accu- 
racy cannot be trusted ( Woo et al., 2017 ; Poldrack  et al., 2019 ) as it 
may arise from overﬁtting,  circular  analysis  ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2009 ) 
or researchers’  degrees  of freedom  ( Ioannidis,  2005 ). This is particularly  
critical for machine  learning  approaches,  where classiﬁers  trained  on 
data from one sample may be unable to generalise  to additional  samples  
( Ecker et al., 2015 ). Publication  incentives  lead researchers  to seek and 
report the best prediction  accuracy.  For brain-imaging  biomarkers  of 
ASD, publications  have reported  accuracies  above 95% ( Bi et al., 2018 ). 
If that were true, the accuracy  of those algorithms  would be equiva-  
lent to the inter-rater  reliability  of clinical  assessment  by human experts  
(kappa = 95%) which deﬁnes the gold-standard  for discrimination  of ASD 
versus other development  disorders  ( Klin et al., 2000 ). But how trust- 
worthy  is the evaluation  of biomarkers  such as those in ( Bi et al., 2018 ), 
given that the whole study –biomarker  extraction  and validation  –was 
done on only 50 ASD patients  and 42 non-ASD  controls?  Peer-review  is not suﬃcient  to assess the analytic  choices  as even minor variants  lead 
to large diﬀerences  in observed  prediction  accuracy,  though these are 
unlikely  to reveal true improvements  ( Varoquaux,  2018 ). 
To ground  solid conclusions  on ASD neuroimaging,  several interna-  
tional consortia  have been constituted  such as ABIDE (Autism  Brain 
Imaging  Data Exchange,  Di Martino  et al., 2014b ; Di Martino  et al., 
2017 ), EU-AIMS  (European  Autism Interventions  - A Multicentre  Study 
for Developing  New Medications,  Murphy  and Spooren,  2012 ) or the 
IBIS Network  (Infant Brain Imaging  Study, Hazlett  et al., 2012 ), in- 
creasing  sample sizes through  data sharing.  They extend the amount  
and quality of the data collected  through  harmonisation  eﬀorts. Recent 
analysis  across cohorts  has shown that ASD is signiﬁcantly  associated  
with changes  in functional  connectivity  ( Holiga et al., 2019 ). But are 
these changes  large enough  to ground  reliable  prediction  to new sites, 
despite heterogeneity  in imaging  techniques  and populations  recruited?  
The study we present  built upon these large cohorts,  and framed the 
extraction  of biomarkers  as an open, international  challenge  to predict 
ASD from the largest MRI dataset currently  available  –more than 2000 
individuals.  A data-science  prediction  challenge  of this type can provide  
conclusive  evidence  on the ability of MRI to detect ASD, because  it is 
based on a blind evaluation  of the results in addition  to relying on a large 
sample.  Furthermore,  it isolates  the development  of the analysis  pipeline  
from its evaluation.  Challengers  did not have access to validation  data, 
which allowed  us to test the ability of the algorithms  to generalise  to 
unseen data, including  data acquired  in diﬀerent  centres.  
Materials  and methods  
Brain imaging  dataset 
The brain imaging  dataset combined  data from the public Autism 
Brain Imaging  Data Exchange  (ABIDE)  I and II datasets  ( Di Martino  
et al., 2014a ; Di Martino  et al., 2017 ) and an unpublished  dataset from 
the Robert DebréHospital  (RDB) in Paris, France (see Supplemental  Ta- 
ble 1 for additional  demographic  information  for the RDB site). ABIDE 
provides  open access to functional  and anatomical  MRI data for 2156 
subjects.  The RDB dataset contained  data from 247 subjects,  56 of whom 
were also part of the ABIDE II project:  we excluded  these duplicate  sub- 
jects from the private dataset.  With the exception  of data coming  from 
the RDB centre which was acquired  in a 1.5 Tesla scanner,  all MRI data 
was acquired  in 3 Tesla scanners.  In all sites subjects  were diagnosed  us- 
ing standard  ADI/ADOS  tools to support  clinical  assessment.  Most sub- 
jects had a full IQ > 75. 
We extracted  anatomical  features  from the anatomical  MRI: regional  
brain volumes,  cortical  thickness,  and surface area; and extracted  time- 
series signals from the resting-state  functional  MRI. To derive these in- 
dividual  measurements,  the data were processed  with standard  neu- 
roimaging  tools: Freesurfer  ( Fischl et al., 1999 ), FSL ( Woolrich  et al., 
2009 ), and AFNI ( Cox, 1996 ). We split the total dataset into public 
and private datasets,  aiming at balancing  the age and sex distributions  
( Table 1 and Fig. 1 provide  demographic  information  for the public and 
private datasets).  A total of 2117 subjects  were included:  947 ASD and 
1170 controls.  We did not exclude  subjects  based on quality control,  but 
provided  challengers  with quality control scores obtained  from visual 
inspection  by 3 experts.  The public dataset contained  data from 1150 
subjects:  549 ASD and 601 controls.  The private dataset contained  data 
from 967 subjects:  398 ASD and 569 controls.  The public dataset was a 
subset of ABIDE I and II, while the private dataset combined  data from 
ABIDE I, II and RDB. The dataset should capture  well the clinical  and 
methodological  heterogeneity  of ASD neuroimaging.  The ABIDE dataset

from intermittent  vasoconstriction  either elicited by 
widespread,  episodic  drops in electrocortical  activ- 
ity (ECA) ( “neural pathway  ”), for example  during an 
EEG slow wave, or through  brief changes  in autoreg-  
ulation ( “autonomic  pathway  ”). In the neural path- 
way, vasoconstrictions  lag reductions  in electrocor-  
tical activity by the well-established  4–6 s delay dic- 
tated by the hemodynamic  response  ( de Zwart et al., 
2005 ; Liu et al., 2000 ). Autonomic  pathway  delays 
are longer and may reach 12–15 s, owing to the more 
sluggish  eﬀects of sympathetic  and respiratory  activ- 
ity on vascular  tone ( Birn et al., 2008 ; Chang and 
Glover, 2009 ). During NREM sleep, joint changes  
in ECA and autonomic  activity may be orchestrated  
by joint activations  of (cortical)  arousal and auto- 
nomic arousal promoting  regions in the brain stem 
( “brain stem activation  ”), whose substrates  partially  
overlap ( Benarroch,  2018 ). This may, for exam- 
ple, be in response  to an arousing  stimulus,  either 
from the external  environment,  or internally  gener- 
ated (e.g. gastric stimulus,  autonomic/baroreceptor  
signal, etc.). AAS = Autonomic  Arousal System

( Fultz et al., 2019 ) and CSF pulsations  is the result of brief changes  in 
autonomic  activity,  for example  autonomic  arousals  triggered  jointly 
with K-complexes  by activation  of the brain stem ( Fig. 1 , “brain stem 
activation  ”)? If so, this may imply that an additional,  autonomic  mech- 
anism exists for the generation  of myoactive  CSF pulsations,  and possi- 
bly that not a lack of sleep, but rather compromized  autonomic  regula- 
tion of cerebral  vascular  tone aﬀects brain waste clearance  through  CSF 
pulsations.  To investigate  this, we compared  fMRI data with measures  
of autonomic  physiology  obtained  across the full sleep-wake  cycle and 
during a waking  autonomic  challenge  in the form of a voluntary  deep 
inspiration.  
2. Results  
To explore  the association  between  slow waves, autonomic  events, 
and CSF pulsations,  we ﬁrst re-analyzed  data from a previous  overnight  
sleep study, which included  Blood Oxygenation  Level Dependent  
(BOLD)  fMRI, Electro-encephalography  (EEG), as well as autonomic  
indicators.  The latter included  respiratory  ﬂow rate (RFR) as derived  
from a sensor measuring  chest circumference  ( “chest belt ”), as well 
as peripheral  vascular  volume  (PVV) derived  from ﬁnger skin photo- 
plethysmography,  an indicator  of sympathetic  vasoconstrictive  activity  
( Ozbay et al., 2018 ). A total of 59.5 hours’ worth of data from 12 sub- 
jects, distributed  across all sleep states, was included  in the analysis  
( Table 1 , see Materials  and Methods  for data selection).  In our analy- 
sis, the fMRI global signal (GS) was used as a proxy for total CBV ( SM 
Note 3 ), whereas  the fMRI signal in the fourth ventricle  and its con- necting  cerebral  aqueduct  revealed  CSF ﬂow into the brain (while being 
insensitive  to ﬂow out of the brain, see ( SM Data Analysis  )). Spectral  
ﬁltering  in the 0.33–2.0  Hz band was used to extract slow wave activ- 
ity (SWA) from the EEG signal across all sleep stages ( Materials  and 
Methods  ). 
2.1. N2 slow waves occur jointly with CSF pulsations  and autonomic  
arousals  
Initial inspection  of the data indeed suggested  that the joint oc- 
currence  of K-complex  type slow waves, GS changes,  and autonomic  
arousals  reported  previously  during stage N2 sleep ( Ozbay et al., 2019 ) 
was also associated  with CSF inﬂow events ( Fig. 2 ). Comprehensive  
( n = 12) lag-dependent  correlation  analysis  ( Fig. 3 a,b ) indicated  that 
CSF inﬂow trailed SWA by 6–10 s, while fMRI GS changes  trailed SWA 
by 8–15 s. We also observed  a strong negative  correlation  near zero lag 
between  the derivative  of fMRI GS and the CSF signal ( Fig. 3 c ), which 
supports  the mechanistic  interpretation  that CBV decreases  cause CSF 
inﬂow ( Fultz et al., 2019 ). 
Further  analysis  showed  that signiﬁcant  correlation  between  SWA 
and CSF/GS  also occurred  outside  N2 ( Figs. 4 , S1 ). Importantly,  for 
NREM sleep, the variance  in fMRI signals explained  by SWA reduced  af- 
ter autonomic  correction  ( Fig. 4 , Table S1 ). This correction  was based 
on the estimated  relationship  between  the autonomic  signals (RFR and 
PVV) and the fMRI signal ( SM: Materials  and Methods  ). For GS, these 
variance  reductions  were 36 ± 32%, 68 ± 14%, 70 ± 15% for N3, N2, 
N1, respectively,  while for CSF, they were 34 ± 26%, 71 ± 15%, and 
50 ± 36%, respectively  (mean ± sd, Student’s  paired t -test: p < 0.05). 
This conﬁrms  the potential  role of autonomic  activity  in the observed  
SWA-fMRI  correlations.  
2.2. CSF pulsatile  activity does not follow the slow wave density increase  
with increasing  sleep depth 
While the correlation  analysis  presented  above suggests  that both 
autonomic  events (i.e. brief changes  in autonomic  activity)  and electro-  
cortical  activity  may contribute  to CSF pulsations,  it does not report on

EEG spectrogram  with identiﬁcation  of sleep stages. ( B ) During light (N1, N2) sleep, intermittent  SWA attributed  to K-complexes  is followed  by autonomic  arousal, 
as evidenced  by increases  in respiratory  ﬂow rate (RFR), a reduction  in peripheral  vascular  volume (PVV), CSF inﬂow, and GS reduction.  This association  appears 
reduced  during deep (N3) sleep, despite an increase  in SWA. Signals are normalized  to temporal  standard  deviation,  except GS and CSF (% of mean). Inset ( C ) shows

their relative  strengths  across the various  sleep stages or whether  they 
possibly  explain  the previously  reported  association  between  the preva- 
lence of slow waves (also called slow wave density,  or slow wave power) 
and waste clearance  ( Xie et al., 2013 ; Hablitz  et al., 2019 ). To allow for 
a more quantitative  comparison,  we estimated  the ﬂuctuation  levels of 
CSF and GS from their temporal  standard  deviation  and compared  it 
to slow wave density  (equal to SWA prior to detrending,  see Materials  
and Methods  ). We found that going from N1 and N2 on one hand, to 
N3 on the other, slow wave density  increased  by 224 ± 123% (mean 
± sd, t -test: p < 4 ×10 − 6 ) while in contrast  CSF and GS ﬂuctuation  
levels decreased  by 14 ± 12%, ( t -test: p < 8 ×10 − 4 ) and 19 ± 22% ( t - 
test: p < 8 ×10 − 3 ), respectively.  This suggests  that SWA itself is not the 
dominant  source of the observed  CSF pulsations  across sleep and that 
the previously  reported  increased  brain waste clearance  during deep 
sleep-like  conditions  in rodents  ( Xie et al., 2013 ; Hablitz  et al., 2019 ), 
if present  in human,  does not rely on CSF pulsations.

2.1. Setup 
All data was acquired  on a Philips Achieva  7 Tesla MR System 
(Philips  Healthcare,  Best, The Netherlands),  with a quadrature  trans- 
mit coil and 32-channel  head receive  array (Nova Medical,  Wilmington,  
MA, USA). 
Concurrent  magnetic  ﬁeld monitoring  was performed  using 16 
ﬂuorine-based  NMR ﬁeld probes,  which were integrated  into the head 
setup via a laser-sintered  nylon frame positioned  between  transmit  and 
receive  coil ( Fig. 1 in Engel et al., 2018 ). Probe data were recorded  
and preprocessed  (ﬁltering,  demodulation)  on a dedicated  acquisition  
system ( Dietrich  et al., 2016a ). The ﬁnal extraction  of probe phase evo- 
lution and projection  onto a spherical  harmonic  basis set ( Barmet  et al., 
2008 ) was performed  on a PC, yielding  readout  time courses  of global 
phase k 0 and k -space coeﬃcients  𝑘 𝑥 , 𝑘 𝑦 , 𝑘 𝑧 with 1 MHz bandwidth.  
For the fMRI experiments,  visual stimulus  presentation  utilized  Vi- 
suaStim  LCD goggles  (Resonance  Technology  Inc., Northridge,  CA, 
USA). A vendor-speciﬁc  respiratory  bellows  and ﬁnger pulse plethysmo-  
graph recorded  subject physiology,  i.e., respiratory  and cardiac  cycle. 
2.2. fMRI paradigm  and subjects  
Seven healthy  subjects  (4 female,  mean age 25.7 + /- 4.1 y) took part 
in this study, after written  informed  consent  and with approval  of the 
local ethics committee.  One subject was excluded  from further analysis  
due to reduced  signal in multiple  channels  of the head receive  array. 
Thus, six subjects  were analyzed  for this study. 
The paradigm,  a modiﬁed  version  of the one used in Kasper et al. 
(2014 ), comprised  two blocks of 15 s duration  that presented  ﬂicker- 
ing checkerboard  wedges  in complementary  pairs of the visual quarter-  
ﬁelds. In one block, u pper l eft and l ower r ight visual ﬁeld were stimu- 
lated simultaneously  (condition  ULLR), while the other block presented  
the wedges  in the u pper r ight and l ower l eft quarter-ﬁelds  (condition  
URLL). These stimulation  blocks were interleaved  with equally  long ﬁx- 
ation periods.  To keep subjects  engaged,  they had to respond  to slight 
contrast  changes  in the central ﬁxation  cross via button presses of the 
right hand. A single run of the paradigm  took 5 min (5 repetitions  of the 
2  L. Kasper, M. Engel, J. Heinzle et al. NeuroImage  246 (2022) 118738 
ULLR-Fixation-URLL-Fixation  sequence).  For both of the spiral sequence  
designs  (high-resolution  spiral-out  and combined  spiral in/out, see next 
section),  a single run of the paradigm  was performed  per subject.

jects in order to build atlases ( Guevara  et al., 2017; Román et al., 2017; 
Zhang et al., 2018 ). It is often considered  that the cortical  folding pattern  
morphology  is speciﬁc  to each human being ( Wachinger  et al., 2015 ). 
Hence, it is important  to realize that each folding variation  implies  a 
particular  rearrangement  of the geometry  of the underlying  ﬁbers. For 
example,  the short ﬁbers that connect  the two regions  on either side 
of a large ﬁssure necessarily  change geometry  when that ﬁssure is in- 
terrupted  by a transverse  gyrus. It has been recently  hypothesized  that 
such transverse  gyri, that can be buried in the ﬁssure or apparent,  may 
play a speciﬁc  role relative  to the organization  of ﬁbers, probably  be- 
cause they oﬀer the shortest  path between  the two sides of the ﬁssure 
( Bodin et al., 2020; Mangin  et al., 2019; Pron et al., 2021 ). In the 
same vein, a branch stemming  from a ﬁssure is partially  interrupting  
the gyrus along the ﬁssure,  which has a strong impact on the geometry  
of the white matter hosting  the ﬁbers connecting  diﬀerent  areas of this 
gyrus. 
When the strategy  used to infer an atlas of the short bundles  is based 
on matching  the bundle 3D geometries  across subjects  ( Guevara  et al., 
2012; O’Donnell  et al., 2013; Vázquez  et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2008 ), it 
is disturbed  by the great range of possibilities  of the folding phenomena  
mentioned  above. The problem  can be surmounted  when mapping  only 
the longest  or the largest bundles,  but the situation  is more complex  for 
short bundles  with small diameters.  At ﬁrst glance, non-linear  spatial 
normalization  can partly overcome  these diﬃculties  and lead to richer 
bundle atlases,  provided  that the matching  of the main sulci is guaran-  
teed ( Labra et al., 2019 ). However,  in the most variable  areas, aligning  
incompatible  folding patterns  remains  a disturbing  issue. 
A better solution  could be to match only the bundle extremities,  us- 
ing 2D spatial normalization  of the cortical  surfaces,  ideally driven not 
only by surface curvature  but also by other multimodal  proxies  of archi- 
tecture ( Glasser  et al., 2016; Robinson  et al., 2014 ). An explicit  strategy  
of this type has been proposed  to map the U-ﬁbers  surrounding  the cen- 
tral sulcus ( Pron et al., 2021 ): in this study, a central-sulcus-dedicated  
connectivity  space (a two-dimensional  Cartesian  domain)  parameterized  
by the gyral crests adjacent  to the sulcus, is used to align U-ﬁbers  across 
subjects  using only the localization  of their extremities  along the crests. 
A further manual  reﬁnement  of this strategy  consists  in adding an aﬃne 
transformation  to each crest parameterization  in order to align the hand 
knob landmark  across subjects.  Using this dedicated  space, reproducible  
U-ﬁber bundles  can be highlighted  as clusters.  It has been shown how- 
ever that the topography  of cortical  areas in associative  regions  vary in 
such a way that spatial warping  cannot always align them. Hence the 
ultimate  approach  will probably  come from methodologies  using Ma- 
chine Learning  (ML) to project architectural  parcellations  using their 
multimodal  signatures  ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). Such ML-based  approaches,  
indeed,  can deal with variable  topographies  provided  that a unique par- 
cellation  scheme  can ﬁt any individual  architecture,  which is today the 
usual hypothesis.  
In this paper, however,  we tackle an alternative  strategy  that does 
not require  any hypothesis  on the existence  of such a common  parcella-  
tion scheme.  This strategy,  dedicated  to the mapping  of the ﬁbers sur- 
rounding  one or a few sulci, in the spirit of the work of Pron et al. (2021) , 
builds upon a stratiﬁcation  of the population  based on the regional  ﬁber 
geometry.  This stratiﬁcation  into homogeneous  groups of subjects  is per- 
formed  in order to infer a family of shape-speciﬁc  bundle atlases.  The 
stratiﬁcation  relies on a generic  manifold  learning  strategy  that can be 
applied  to any white matter region. During a second step, the family 
of atlases is reduced  to a whole population  atlas. For this purpose,  an 
atlas-matching  procedure  has to be performed  to achieve  a consistent  
description  of the white matter geometry  across the whole population.  
In this paper, the matching  procedure  is only geometry-based,  but in the 
future, it could be designed  from multimodal  data providing  a proxy of 
each group speciﬁc  functional  architecture.  The most obvious  advantage  
of this stratiﬁcation-based  strategy  is to decouple  the problem  of match- 
ing bundles  across subjects  from the problem  of registering  incompatible  
folding patterns.  Moreover,  it actually  addresses  a wider objective:  it al- lows us to achieve  such a decoupling  whenever  the population  embeds  
a regional  variability  of the ﬁber patterns  that may disturb the bun- 
dle matching  procedure,  whatever  the origin of this variability.  Such a 
variability  may be of developmental  origin or artifactual,  induced  by a 
problem  of spatial normalization.  This stratiﬁcation-based  strategy  was 
initially  proposed  to restrict fMRI statistical  analysis  to groups of sub- 
jects with compatible  folding pattern  ( Mangin  et al., 2016; Sun et al., 
2016 ). 
In a way, the stratiﬁcation-based  strategy  is an extension  of the usual 
multi-subject  bundle atlases,  which represent  each bundle with a sam- 
pling of this bundle’s  diﬀerent  conﬁgurations  in the general  population  
( Guevara  et al., 2012 ). This sampling  provides  a representation  of the 
inter-subject  variability  that is used to achieve  an eﬃcient  projection  of 
the atlas onto any new subject,  whose ﬁbers are labelled  according  to 
the closest match in the atlas. When dealing  with short bundles,  how- 
ever, the spatial normalization  strategy  is not suﬃcient  to disentangle  
the ambiguities  between  overlapping  bundle representations  of a pop- 
ulation.  Therefore,  our new strategy  aims at ﬁrst forcing each subject 
towards  the most similar stratiﬁed  atlas before performing  the match- 
ing procedure  leading  to label the ﬁbers. 
In this paper, we provide  a proof of concept  of this stratiﬁcation-  
based strategy  through  the mapping  of the short ﬁber bundles  surround-  
ing two speciﬁc  sulci: the central sulcus and the superior  temporal  sul- 
cus. We use a simple stratiﬁcation  strategy  based on the regional  ﬁber 
geometry,  inspired  by a method  used to stratify the shape of cortical  
sulci ( Sun et al., 2012 ). The aim of this sulcus-based  study was to link the 
variability  of the central sulcus pattern  with handedness.  For this pur- 
pose, a pairwise  geometric  distance  matrix across central sulci was com- 
puted ﬁrst. Then manifold  learning  was used to model the inter-subject  
variability  of the central sulcus pattern  with a simple one-dimensional  
space inferred  from the Isomap  algorithm  ( Tenenbaum  et al., 2000 ). 
Finally,  it was found that the coordinate  in this space mainly quanti-  
ﬁes the location  of the hand knob and is related to handedness.  In our 
paper however,  we aim to test the hypothesis  that the main source of 
variability  of the ﬁber geometry  is the variability  of the folding pattern.  
For this purpose,  we compare  a sulcus-based  stratiﬁcation  with a ﬁber- 
based stratiﬁcation.  The ﬁber-based  stratiﬁcation  uses pairwise  geomet-  
ric distances  across subtractograms,  which are deﬁned  as regional  sets of 
ﬁbers surrounding  speciﬁc  sulci. In order to achieve  that, we introduce  
a reﬁned ﬁber distance  embedding  angular  considerations  dedicated  to 
short ﬁbers. This new distance  aims at lowering  the amount  of ambi- 
guities when matching  ﬁber trajectories.  Also, in order to evaluate  the 
similitude  between  a pair of subtractograms,  we present  a new dedicated  
subtractogram  distance  measure  that quantiﬁes  the coincidence  of their 
ﬁber’s geometry.  Manifold  learning  is also performed  with the Isomap  
algorithm.  This results in a ﬁber-based  stratiﬁcation  that is then used 
to split the population  into groups with similar patterns  of ﬁber geom- 
etry in the region of interest.  Next, we perform  a two-step  bundle-atlas  
inference,  ﬁrst at the group-level,  second at the population  level after 
matching  the group-level  atlases.  Finally,  in order to clarify which of the 
resulting  bundles  in the population-level  atlas are the ones presenting  
important  diﬀerences  across the population,  we propose  an algorithm  
to identify  those that drive most of the inter-subject  variability  encoded  
in the manifold.

spatial and angular  resolution,  as well as the contrast-to-noise  ratio, of 
the dMRI data that can be acquired  routinely  for in vivo studies.  One 
of the main motivations  behind this improvement  was the expectation  
that higher quality of dMRI data, and speciﬁcally  of data acquired  with 
high b -values,  would lead to more accurate  tractography.  The ultra- 
high b -values that can be achieved  with these new technologies  have 
been shown to reduce the uncertainty  of probabilistic  estimates  of dif- 
fusion orientations  ( Setsompop  et al., 2013 ) and to sharpen  determin-  
istic estimates  of orientation  distribution  functions  ( Fan et al., 2014 ). 
These ﬁndings  suggest  improved  ability to resolve crossing  ﬁber bun- 
dles. However,  not all ﬁber conﬁgurations  in the brain can be modeled  
as crossings,  and dMRI voxel sizes are still at a scale where multiple  ﬁber 
conﬁgurations  can lead to indistinguishable  diﬀusion  proﬁles.  As a re- 
sult, tractography  is still imperfect.  Therefore,  the recent improvements  
in dMRI data quality have not obviated  the need for validating  the out- 
put of tractography  algorithms;  on the contrary,  they have created  the 
need for more sophisticated  validation  methods,  capable  of evaluating  
the ﬁne-grained  anatomy  that can be captured  by state-of-the-art  dMRI. 
Prior to the introduction  of dMRI, all of our knowledge  on the cir- 
cuitry of the brain came from post mortem  anatomical  studies,  using var- 
ious techniques  for dissection,  tracing,  histology,  and microscopy.  These 
are also the tools that we have at our disposal  for post mortem  valida- 
tion of dMRI. The main focus of this review is connectional  anatomy,  
hence we discuss techniques  for validating  the pathways  that are output 
by tractography  algorithms,  or the local diﬀusion  orientations  that are 
the input to those algorithms.  However,  in many applications  of trac- 
tography,  the ultimate  goal is to extract tract-speciﬁc  biomarkers.  In 
that sense, tractography  is closely intertwined  with dMRI microstruc-  
tural modeling.  Thus, we also survey the post mortem  validation  of mi- 
crostructural  parameters  estimated  from dMRI data. 
For a precise,  voxel-by-voxel  comparison  of white-matter  circuitry  
and microstructure  as obtained  from dMRI and anatomy,  both the dMRI 
and anatomical  validation  data should be collected  from the same brain. 
Given the changes  that a brain undergoes  when it is excised  and ﬁxed, 
the dMRI scan should be collected  after these procedures.  Therefore,  
validation  studies require  expertise  in both ex vivo dMRI scanning  and 
anatomy.  In Section  2 , we review the main methodological  considera-  
tions for collecting  ex vivo dMRI data. In Section  3 , we provide  a brief 
overview  of the evolution  of anatomical  studies,  and speciﬁcally  the 
techniques  that can be used to obtain “gold standard  ”data for compari-  
son to dMRI. We then discuss in more detail the validation  of tractogra-  
phy ( Section  4 ), ﬁber orientations  ( Section  5 ), and other microstructural  
parameters  ( Section  6 ). We end with a discussion  of open questions  and 
future directions  in Section  7 . 
2. Ex vivo dMRI 
Ex vivo dMRI acquisitions  can harness  the advantages  of higher mag- 
netic ﬁeld and/or gradient  strengths,  more sensitive  radiofrequency  (RF) 
coils, and longer scan times. With tailored  acquisition  pulse sequences,  
isotropic  spatial resolutions  of a few hundred  microns  can be achieved  
for the whole brain and smaller  specimens.  This is almost an order of 
magnitude  higher than typical in vivo resolutions  of 1.5-2 mm. In recent 
years, ex vivo dMRI has emerged  as a powerful  tool for 3D mapping  of 
human brain circuitry  at mesoscopic  scales, which is particularly  im- 
portant  for comparison  and validation  of tractography  methods  using 
complementary  post mortem  modalities.  
Tissue ﬁxation  and preparation  procedures  must be optimized  care- 
fully to ensure high-quality  ex vivo dMRI, as discussed  extensively  else- 
where ( D’Arceuil  et al., 2007 ; Dyrby et al., 2011 ; Miller et al., 2011 ; 
Dyrby et al., 2018 ). In particular,  the specimen  setup is aimed at min- 
imizing  the eﬀects of mechanical  vibrations  and tissue instability  over 
time. As dMRI experiments  are also especially  sensitive  to temperature  
variations,  temperature  monitoring  is often used for scans with long du- 
rations ( Dyrby et al., 2011 ). Important  considerations  for ex vivo dMRI protocol  design are the re- 
duced T 2 and reduced  diﬀusivity  of ﬁxed tissue ( D’Arceuil  et al., 2007 ; 
Pfeﬀerbaum  et al., 2004; Roebroeck  et al., 2019 ). While the former leads 
directly  to loss of signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR), the latter requires  heavier  
diﬀusion  weighting  to oﬀset the loss in contrast-to-noise  ratio (CNR), 
but also contributes  to further loss of SNR. Both of these factors need 
to be taken into account  when designing  optimal  acquisition  sequences  
and sampling  schemes  for ex vivo imaging.  The species and anatomical  
structures  of interest  must also be factored  in to determine  the optimal  
spatial resolution.  For example,  brain mass and number  of neurons  scale 
by four orders of magnitude  as we go from the mouse to the marmoset,  
to the macaque  monkey,  and ﬁnally to the human brain ( Herculano-  
Houzel,  2009 ). Below we discuss the main technical  considerations  for 
acquiring  ex vivo dMRI data in the brain, and highlight  the diﬀerent  ac- 
quisition  sequences  that can be used to achieve  the high image quality 
and spatial/angular  resolutions  needed  for tractography  and microstruc-  
ture validation  studies.  
Acquisition  of ex vivo dMRI datasets  often requires  the use of tai- 
lored pulse sequences  to combat  the loss in SNR and CNR due to re- 
duced T 2 and diﬀusivity  of ﬁxed tissue. While 2D single-shot  echo pla- 
nar imaging  (ss-EPI)  sequences  are most widely used for in vivo dMRI 
of the human brain, these are sub-optimal  for ex vivo imaging,  as the 
shorter T 2 precludes  the use of lengthy  echo trains. Moreover,  the de- 
crease of diﬀusivity  in ﬁxed tissues must be oﬀset by an increase  in b - 
values ( Sun et al., 2005 ; Roebroeck  et al., 2019 ), achieved  with stronger  
diﬀusion-weighting  gradients  and/or longer gradient  durations.  This 
can exacerbate  eddy-current  induced  distortions  when k -space is tra- 
versed in a single shot. Thus, multi-shot  acquisition  techniques  and 3D 
echo trains are ideal for ex vivo dMRI. These techniques  are not widely 
used in vivo , as they typically  suﬀer from severe artifacts  due to motion-  
induced  phase errors across excitations.  In ex vivo imaging,  however,  
motion is not an issue, provided  the specimen  preparation  ensures  sta- 
bility over the duration  of the scan. 
The most common  acquisition  strategies  for ex vivo dMRI are sum- 
marized  in Table 1 . Compared  to 2D ss-EPI, 3D multi-shot  or seg- 
mented  EPI sequences  allow for shorter eﬀective  echo times and thus 
higher SNR, and have been used for ex vivo dMRI of the whole human 
brain at 3 T ( McNab et al., 2009 ; Miller et al., 2011 ; McNab et al., 
2013 ) and the intact human brainstem  at preclinical  ﬁeld strengths  
( Aggarwal  et al., 2013 ). Multi-echo  acquisitions  involving  repetitions  
of segmented  EPI readouts  at diﬀerent  echo times can be used to im- 
prove SNR ( Eichner  et al., 2020 ). On the other end of the spectrum,  
spin-echo  (SE) readouts,  which traverse  a single line in k -space per ex- 
citation,  have also been used for ex vivo dMRI ( D’Arceuil  et al., 2007 ; 
Dyrby et al., 2011 ; Guilfoyle  et al., 2003 ; Modo et al., 2016 ). While these 
allow the highest  anatomical  ﬁdelity  with low geometric  distortion,  de- 
pending  on the targeted  spatial and angular  resolution,  they require  pro- 
hibitively  long scan times due to the relatively  low SNR eﬃciency.  At 
these lengthy  scan times, problems  with both magnetic  ﬁeld drift and 
specimen  stability  can become  signiﬁcant.  
Diﬀusion  weighted  (DW) sequences  with multiple  RF-pulse  echo 
trains, such as fast spin echo or gradient  and spin echo, enable accel- 
erated 3D imaging  by factors of ∼4-12x as compared  to DW-SE,  while 
minimizing  the distortion-related  artifacts  that DW-EPI  sequences  are 
prone to, and can therefore  achieve  combined  high spatial and angu- 
lar resolutions  ( Aggarwal  et al., 2010 ; Tyszka and Frank, 2009 ). These 
may currently  oﬀer the best trade-oﬀ between  SNR eﬃciency  and im- 
age quality for smaller  specimens,  but require  sophisticated  schemes  
to correct for phase error induced  artifacts,  including  but not limited 
to, the acquisition  of navigator  echoes or reference  phase scans. Using 
volumetric  excitations,  the 3D k -space encoding  can be further opti- 
mized to separate  out eddy current  and T 2 -decay eﬀects on diﬀerent  
k -space axes for techniques  that combine  gradient-  and spin-echoes,  
thereby  allowing  dMRI data to be acquired  with high SNR eﬃciency  
and reduced  artifacts  ( Aggarwal  et al., 2010 ). Such combined  high 
spatial-angular  resolutions  are crucial,  e.g., for resolving  ﬁber orien-

Summary  of ex vivo dMRI acquisition  methods.  The 3D sequences  commonly  used for ex vivo dMRI are compared  in terms of SNR eﬃciency  
and factors aﬀecting  image quality. The approximate  acceleration  factors are computed  for similar in-plane  resolutions  and repetition  times. Note 
that, in practice,  the echo times and relative T2/T2 ∗ weighting  also vary across the sequences  and can aﬀect the image contrast.  (DW: diﬀusion-  
weighted;  SE: spin-echo;  RARE: rapid acquisition  with relaxation  enhancement;  GRASE: gradient  and spin echo; EPI: echo planar imaging;  ss:

In addition  to optimized  readout  strategies  to combat  the eﬀects of 
reduced  T 2 , depending  on the application  at hand, modiﬁcations  to the 
diﬀusion  encoding  may also be necessary.  The b -values used for ex vivo 
dMRI need to be considerably  higher than their in vivo counterparts,  
typically  by factors of 2-4x, in order to achieve  comparable  diﬀusion  
contrast  ( Dyrby et al., 2011 ; Roebroeck  et al., 2019 ; Schilling  et al., 
2017a ). At such high b -values,  eddy-current  artifacts  are particularly  
problematic,  and can be further exacerbated  when moving  to higher 
ﬁeld strengths.  For micro-imaging  applications  (voxel sizes < 100 μm) 
at high ﬁeld, bipolar  diﬀusion-encoding  gradients  can be combined  with 
multi-echo  readouts  to reduce the eﬀects of eddy currents  ( Reese et al., 
2003 ). As another  alternative,  DW steady-state  free precession  (SSFP) 
sequences,  which can retain signal over multiple  repetition  intervals,  
have been shown to provide  improved  SNR eﬃciency  with heavy diﬀu- 
sion weighting  for whole brain ex vivo dMRI at 3 T and 7 T ( Foxley et al., 
2014 ; Miller et al., 2012 ). The slower T 1 decay at higher ﬁeld strengths  
can also be harnessed  for strong diﬀusion  weighting  by employing  
stimulated-echo  preparations,  as shown for whole brain ex vivo dMRI 
at 9.4 T ( Fritz et al., 2019 ). 
Ex vivo acquisitions  can also beneﬁt from advances  in gradient  hard- 
ware or customized  RF coils. Multi-channel  coils, custom-built  to closely 
ﬁt the whole brain or smaller  specimens,  can allow increased  reception  
sensitivity,  thereby  leading  to a boost in the achievable  SNR. For whole- 
brain imaging  on human scanners,  custom-built  coils have been shown 
to lead to SNR gains of ∼1.6-2 fold as compared  to standard  in vivo head 
coils ( Edlow et al., 2019 ; Roebroeck  et al., 2015 ; Scholz et al., 2021 ). 
When combined  with parallel  transmit  RF pulses for B 1 + homogeneity,  
maximal  SNR gain of as much as 5-fold was reported  in the peripheral  
cortex using a custom-built  cylindrical  phased-array  receive  coil for the 
ex vivo occipital  lobe at 9.4 T ( Sengupta  et al., 2018 ). Customized  trans- 
mit/receive  RF coils can be further combined  with optimized  acquisition  
pulse sequences  such as DW-SSFP  to achieve  improved  SNR for whole- 
brain ex vivo dMRI at submillimeter  resolutions  ( Fritz et al., 2016 ). These 
advances  in RF coils can enable the acquisition  of much higher-quality  
dMRI validation  data sets than what would be possible  with standard,  
in vivo coils.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5719, 5722), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(13813, 13817), match=' \n3.'>"

brain subsystems,  including  those involved  in working  memory,  theory-  
of-mind,  and language  comprehension  ( Ferstl et al., 2008 ; Ferstl and 
Von Cramon,  2002 ; Mar, 2011 ). Spatiotemporal  mapping  of the rele- 
vant brain networks  remains  a challenge  in neuroimaging  research.  
The neural substrates  of auditory  narrative  comprehension  have 
been shown to involve  a bilateral  multilobar  cortical  network  that 
prominently  includes  the temporal  lobe, inferior  parietal  lobule (IPL), 
and inferior  frontal gyrus (IFG) by many previous  functional  magnetic  
resonance  imaging  (fMRI) studies ( AbdulSabur  et al., 2014 ; Awad et al., 
2007 ; Binder et al., 2011 ; Brennan  et al., 2012 ; Ferstl et al., 2008 ; 
Friederici  et al., 2000 ; Lerner et al., 2011 ; Mazoyer  et al., 1993 ; 
Schmithorst  et al., 2006 ; Szaﬂarski  et al., 2012 ; Vandenberghe  et al., 
2002 ). These studies have suggested  a bilateral  and fairly symmetrical  
pattern  of activations,  with some evidence  that the right hemisphere  is 
particularly  engaged  when comprehension  requires  greater pragmatic  
inference,  such as in interpreting  unfamiliar  metaphors  and distant se- 
mantic associations  ( AbdulSabur  et al., 2014 ; Ferstl et al., 2005 ; Jung- 
Beeman,  2005 ; Lai et al., 2015 ; Long and Baynes,  2002 ). Since these 
aspects  of narrative  comprehension  can only occur after some amount  
of information  has already  been integrated  from the narrative,  one 
might expect right-hemispheric  engagement  to increase  over the course 
of a narrative.  Increasing  right hemisphere  involvement  was observed  
by Xu et al. ( 2005 ) in an fMRI study using visually  presented  stories. 
Speciﬁcally,  when fMRI activation  during the ﬁnal portion  of a writ- 
ten fable was contrasted  with that observed  during the initial portion  
of the story, the resulting  activation  was predominantly  seen in the 
right hemisphere,  including  regions  of lateral and medial prefrontal  
cortex, anterior  middle and inferior  temporal  gyri, and the angular  
gyrus. 
Given the superior  temporal  resolution,  the dynamics  of the under- 
lying processes  involved  in auditory  narrative  comprehension  can po- 
tentially  be better resolved  by using magnetoencephalography  (MEG) 
( Helenius  et al., 2002 ; Indefrey  and Levelt, 2004 ). MEG can capture  
the time-frequency  dynamics  of oscillatory  phenomena  in the cortex 
with millisecond  resolution  ( Gross, 2019 ). Despite  this potential  advan- 
tage, there are far fewer MEG studies of the brain networks  engaged  
in language  comprehension  compared  to alternative  modalities  such as 
fMRI ( Pylkkänen,  2019 ). Most M/EEG  studies of speech and language  
comprehension  have focused  on the processing  of phonemes  or sin- 
gle words and inferred  cortical  activations  by modeling  the sources  of 
event-related  ﬁelds or potentials  (ERFs/ERPs)  generated  by averaging  
the time-domain  signals following  stimulus  onset. In contrast  to these 
paradigms,  the extraction  of meaning  from narratives  requires  the in- 
tegration  of information  across sentences.  There are several method-  
ological  challenges  to using ERFs/ERPs  to characterize  brain responses  
when stimuli are not impulse-like  but extended  in time like spoken nar- 
ratives,  and several solutions  based on regression  or system identiﬁca-  
tion methods  have been proposed  to deal with them ( Brodbeck  et al., 
2018b ; Crosse et al., 2016 ; de Cheveignéet  al., 2018 ; Lalor et al., 2009 ; 
Smith and Kutas, 2015 ). Extended  speech stimuli have been employed  
in recent years in several MEG studies on aspects  of brain function  such 
as frequency  domain  changes  related to the processing  of speciﬁc  types 
of linguistic  components  ( Armeni  et al., 2019 ), phase and amplitude  en- 
trainment  of responses  in the auditory  cortex ( Gross et al., 2013 ), predic- 
tive coding ( Brodbeck  et al., 2022 , 2018 a; Donhauser  and Baillet, 2020 ; 
Heilbron  et al., 2022 ; Koskinen  et al., 2020 ), or top-down  inﬂuences  
that modulate  auditory  cortex responses  ( Park et al., 2020 , 2015 ). The 
mapping  of cortical  engagement  that can be attributed  speciﬁcally  to 
the comprehension  of narratives  was not the focus of these studies.  To 
date, no MEG studies have investigated  the slower changes  that occur 
across narratives,  resulting  from story meaning  integration  across sen- 
tences. It is debatable  whether  methods  based on ERFs/ERPs  or regres- 
sion are suitable  for mapping  cortical  engagement  far removed  from 
early sensory  areas where assumptions  about the linearity  of responses  
may not be valid. Task- or stimulus-related  changes  in oscillatory  power 
in the cortex provide  an alternative  to the ERP framework  to map cortical  engagement  during extended  stimuli ( Hillebrand  et al., 2005 ; 
Pfurtscheller,  2001 ). 
A large body of evidence  from electrocorticography  (ECoG)  and 
M/EEG  since the 1980s indicates  that an increase  in high-frequency  
power in the gamma  band ( > 40 Hz), accompanied  by a broader  
ﬁeld of power decrements  in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13- 
30 Hz) bands, is the signature  of cortical  engagement  during tasks 
( Crone et al., 2006 , 1998 ; Eulitz et al., 1996 ; Miller et al., 2007 ; 
Neuper  and Pfurtscheller,  2001 ; Pfurtscheller,  1991 ; Pfurtscheller  and 
Andrew,  1999 ; Singh et al., 2002 ). Several  lines of evidence  show that 
high gamma  activity  is strongly  correlated  to the ﬁring rates of local 
neuronal  populations  ( Manning  et al., 2009 ; Nir et al., 2007 ; Ray and 
Maunsell,  2011 ). Both stimulus-related  gamma-power  increments  and 
beta-power  decrements  are also strongly  correlated  to local blood ﬂow 
and the blood oxygen  level-dependent  (BOLD)  signal ( Hall et al., 2014 ; 
Muthukumaraswamy  and Singh, 2008 ; Zumer et al., 2010 ), whereas  
a similar correspondence  between  blood ﬂow and ERPs is not always 
found ( Brovelli  et al., 2005 ; Foucher  et al., 2003 ; Logothetis  et al., 2001 ). 
High gamma-band  activity  arising outside  primary  sensory  or motor 
cortices  is less readily detectable  in M/EEG,  very likely due to signal 
loss caused by the mixing of out-of-phase  rhythms  at the scalp elec- 
trode/MEG  sensor ( Pfurtscheller  and Cooper,  1975 ) and the presence  
of a substantial  myogenic  noise ﬂoor at these frequencies  ( Jerbi et al., 
2009 ; Whitham  et al., 2007 ). However,  task-related  power decrements  
in the beta-band  have been shown to localize  brain areas relevant  to lan- 
guage production  and/or comprehension  by many studies ( Armeni  et al., 
2019 ; Findlay  et al., 2012 ; Fisher et al., 2008 ; Hirata et al., 2010 , 2004 ; 
Kim and Chung, 2008 ; Youssofzadeh  et al., 2020 ). Our use of beta power 
decrements  as a marker  of cortical  engagement  in this study is guided by 
these empirical  observations  and not by any particular  theory of cortical  
oscillations  and their role in cognition.  
We studied  task-related  MEG beta power modulations  in a group of 
healthy  adults enrolled  in the Epilepsy  Connectome  Project (ECP), who 
performed  a story comprehension  task interleaved  with a math task dur- 
ing MEG recording.  This story-math  contrast  was originally  developed  
for fMRI to activate  areas in the anterior  temporal  lobe (ATL) that are 
implicated  in conceptual  integration  and are at risk of damage  during 
temporal  lobe epilepsy  surgeries  ( Binder et al., 2011 ). This task contrast  
was also implemented  for both fMRI and MEG recordings  in healthy  
subjects  who were recruited  as part of the Human  Connectome  Project 
( Larson-Prior  et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ). We hypothesized  
that spatial maps of cortical  engagement  revealed  by task-related  beta 
power decrements  during narrative  comprehension  would be compara-  
ble to those observed  from fMRI. We further hypothesize  that the time 
course of cortical  engagement  will reveal progressively  greater right- 
hemispheric  engagement  as information  is accrued  over a narrative.  
For ease of reporting,  we use the term ""beta decrements""  to refer 
to decreases  in beta-band  source power relative  to the pre-cue  baseline  
period throughout  this paper. In the classical  literature,  event-related  
power changes  have been referred  to as event-related  desynchroniza-  
tion (ERD) or event-related  synchronization  (ERS) depending  on the 
direction  of the power change ( Neuper  et al., 2006 ; Pfurtscheller  and 
Lopes da Silva, 1999 ). We intentionally  avoid the terms synchronization  
and desynchronization  because  they imply a mechanism  for the power 
change that has yet to be established.  
2. Material  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Our participants  were thirty-one  adults (13 men and 18 women)  who

runs, each interleaving  7 blocks of the story and 15 blocks of the 
math tasks, with an average block duration  of 14–24 and 2–13 sec- 
onds for story and math blocks, respectively.  The story blocks present 
participants  with brief auditory  stories (5–9 sentences)  adapted  from 
Aesop’s fables ( www.aesopfables.com  ), followed  by a 2-alternative  
forced-choice  question  that asks participants  about the topic of the

2.2. Story-math  task paradigm  
The story-math  task paradigm  has been described  in detail elsewhere  
( Binder et al., 2011 ). The version  used in the ECP consisted  of 2 runs, 
each with 7 story trials and approximately  14 math trials, as summarized  
in Fig. 1 . 
All stimuli were digital audio recordings  of natural  speech produced  
by an adult male native speaker  of American  English.  The Story task pre- 
sented participants  with brief spoken stories adapted  from Aesop’s  fa- 
bles (aesopfables.com),  followed  by a 2-alternative  forced-choice  ques- 
tion about the topic of the story. The stories feature social interactions,  
typically  including  conversational  exchanges,  between  2 to 3 human or 
anthropomorphic  (usually  animal)  protagonists  and are designed  to il- 
lustrate  stereotypical  human traits and other aphorisms.  For example,  
participants  heard, ""The rabbits were ﬁghting  a war against  the eagles 
and asked the foxes to help them."" The foxes replied,  ""‘We would gladly 
have helped you if we did not know who you were and who you were 
ﬁghting  against.’""  See Tables S1-2 for the contents  of 14 stories and com- 
prehension  questions.  The 14 stories ranged from 1",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5285, 5288), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(11761, 11763), match='3.'>"

1053-8119/©2022  Published  by Elsevier Inc. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND  license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  )  G. Li, S. Jiang, J. Meng et al. NeuroImage  250 (2022) 118969 
Flesher  et al., 2021 ). Within these diﬀerent  types of BCIs, the BCI tech- 
nologies  aiming to reconstruct  motor functions  have been most ex- 
tensively  studied  ( Bensmaia  and Miller, 2014; Nicolelis  and Lebedev,  
2009 ), with the expectation  that they could enable direct autonomous  
control of prosthetic  limbs for paralyzed  people.  
To extract motor-related  neural activities,  both non-invasive  (e.g., 
electroencephalography  (EEG)) and invasive  approaches  (e.g., electro-  
corticography  (ECoG)  and intracortical  recordings)  have been devel- 
oped ( Thakor,  2013 ). Compared  to the non-invasive  approaches,  inva- 
sive techniques  sample neural signals with better spatial and tempo- 
ral resolutions,  suggesting  their higher capability  of carrying  detailed  
and rich neuronal  information  ( Schalk and Leuthardt,  2011; Thakor,  
2013 ). Among  the diverse  invasive  brain signal acquisition  methods,  
ECoG signals recorded  by subdural  surface electrodes  and spiking  ac- 
tivity captured  by intracortical  micro-array  have undergone  extensive  
development  in building  motor BCIs ( Collinger  et al., 2018; Vansteensel  
et al., 2016; Volkova  et al., 2019 ). Using these two recording  tech- 
niques,  successful  decoding  of manifold  motor parameters  (both kinetic 
and kinematic)  have been reported,  e.g., diﬀerent  grasp types ( Nelissen  
et al., 2018; Okorokova  et al., 2020; Pistohl et al., 2012 ) and force lev- 
els ( Flint et al., 2014; Rastogi  et al., 2021 ), a variety of ﬁnger move- 
ments ( Hotson et al., 2016; Kubanek  et al., 2009; Liang and Bougrain,  
2012 ) and gestures  ( Branco et al., 2017; Chestek  et al., 2013 ), and even 
multiple  dimensional  arm trajectory  ( Churchland  et al., 2012; Hauschild  
et al., 2012; Shimoda  et al., 2012 ) and velocity  ( Collinger  et al., 2013; 
Hammer  et al., 2013 ). Notably,  most of these motor BCI studies have 
focused  mainly on the sensorimotor  cortex (especially,  the primary  mo- 
tor cortex, Fetz (1969) ; Rizzolatti  et al. (2014) ), which is known to 
have a direct relationship  with motor preparation,  execution,  and im- 
agery ( Alexander  and Crutcher,  1990; Kakei et al., 1999; Miller et al., 
2010 ). While previous  studies have shown that the completion  of mo- 
tor tasks requires  systematic  processing  of neural information  from dis- 
tributed  networks  spanning  various  brain regions  ( Andersen  and Cui, 
2009; Brovelli  et al., 2017; Ledberg  et al., 2007 ). Therefore,  the de- 
sign of higher performance  BCIs calls for comprehensive  understand-  
ing and utilization  of the neural response  from broader  motor-related  
brain regions,  e.g., both laterally  and vertically  ( Fischer  et al., 2020; 
2017; Nicolelis  and Lebedev,  2009 ). However,  ECoG and intracortical  
micro-array  recordings  are not suﬃcient  enough  to meet this challenge,  
since ECoG records  from a partial surface of the cortex, and intracortical  
micro-arrays  typically  record from 1 to 1.5 mm deep into a limited corti- 
cal area. In this sense, employing  a neural signal acquisition  method  that 
can record both cortical  and subcortical  regions  together  is essentially  
promising.  
As an intracranial  recording  technique  used primarily  for the local- 
ization of epileptic  zones, stereo-encephalography  (SEEG) inserts long 
and thin cylinder  depth electrodes  containing  multiple  contacts  into dif- 
ferent regions  of the brain ( Cardinale  et al., 2016; Parvizi and Kastner,  
2018 ). SEEG has been increasingly  adopted  for clinical  practice  in recent 
years due to smaller  trauma  ( Lang et al., 2016 ), opening  a unique win- 
dow into the investigation  of the neural response  throughout  the brain 
from both cortical  and subcortical  levels, and also providing  the op- 
portunity  for the interpretation  of neuronal  commands.  To date, SEEG 
signals have been preliminarily  used for developing  diﬀerent  types of 
motor BCIs, like hand gesture  classiﬁcation  and imagined  or executed  
grasp force level prediction  ( Fischer  et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Mur- 
phy et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2020 ), validating  that 
SEEG recording  could be a potential  source for BCI application  ( Herﬀ
et al., 2020; Krusienski  and Shih, 2011; Provenza  et al., 2019; Shih and 
Krusienski,  2012 ). However,  till now, the degree to which the neural 
representations  of motor details in the temporal,  spectral,  and spatial 
domain  of SEEG recordings  will impact the decoding  performance  still 
remains  largely unknown.  Particularly,  three questions  remain to be an- 
swered:  (1) How do diﬀerent  regions  of the entire brain respond  to a 
motor task and what is the decoding  performance  of these regions?  (2) 
Which neural component  in the frequency  domain  carries the most task information?  (3) Which time segment  during the task is most informa-  
tive for decoding?  Answering  these questions  will signiﬁcantly  facilitate  
subsequent  BCI studies employing  SEEG signals and other intracranial  
neural recordings  as well. 
Therefore,  to reveal the spatiotemporal  response  from more motor- 
related regions  along both lateral and depth directions,  and to compre-  
hensively  investigate  the representations  of motor neural information  
obtained  from SEEG signals for BCI purpose,  this study analyses  the neu- 
ral response  across diﬀerent  regions  under the same task using a large 
number  of SEEG recordings,  and then systematically  evaluates  the inﬂu- 
ence of diﬀerent  signal components  from multiple  domains  on the motor 
decoding  performance.  The results suggest  that the motor task induces  
distinct  neural responses  from a number  of brain regions,  and it is pos- 
sible to decode diﬀerentiated  hand gestures  using SEEG signals,  where 
the decoding  performance  is tightly related to various  factors including  
spatial locations,  spectral  features,  and temporal  segmentations.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Subjects,  ethics and data recording  
In this study, we recorded  intracranial  data from 32 right-handed  
subjects  (12 female,  20 male, age: 26 ± 6 (rounded  mean ± std) years). 
The subjects  were patients  with intractable  epilepsy  who had SEEG 
electrodes  implanted  for pre-surgical  assessment  of their seizure fo- 
cus. The implantation  conﬁgurations  were totally determined  by clin- 
ical demands  rather than the needs of this research.  The study was 
conducted  in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki  and all sub- 
jects gave informed  consent  for this study, which was approved  by the 
Ethics Committee  of Huashan  Hospital  (Shanghai,  China, Approval  ID: 
KY2019518).  
SEEG signals were recorded  through  a clinical  EEG system (EEG- 
1200C,  Nihon Kohden,  Irvine, CA) and sampled  at 500–2000  Hz (See 
supplementary  Table 1 for the data recording  conﬁgurations  of each 
subject).  During the recording,  the signals of all SEEG contacts  were 
referenced  against  the average  of two adjacent  white matter contacts  
located  remotely  from the suspected  epileptogenic  foci and gray mat- 
ter to enhance  the quality of recordings.  This is the standard  technical  
procedure  ( Landre et al., 2018 ) and was implemented  by the surgeon  
during electrode  implantation.  Electromyographic  (EMG) signals were 
also recorded  from the extensor  carpi radialis  muscle through  two sur- 
face EMG electrodes  using the same ampliﬁer  and same sampling  rate 
as the SEEG signals.  
2.2. Experimental  protocol  
All the subjects  participated  in a visually-cued  hand motor task 
( Fig. 1 A). In detail, the subjects  lied on the bed and faced an LCD screen 
presenting  the visual cues. During each trial of the experiment,  the sub- 
jects ﬁrst rested for 4 s before a warning  sign (cross) prompted  them of 
the upcoming  movement.  After 1 s, a static picture illustrating  one type 
of gesture  (3 types in total, e.g., scissor (M1), rock (M2), and thumb 
(M3), cue in Fig. 1 A) appeared,  which instructed  the subjects  to exe- 
cute that movement.  Then, the subjects  performed  the corresponding  
movement  repetitively  (4–5 times) for 5 s until the movement  cue dis- 
appeared.  Thus, each trial took 10 s (4 s rest, 1 s warning,  and 5 s move- 
ment) and a total of 60 trials were collected  for the entire experiment,  
where each one of three gestures  appeared  randomly  20 times. For each 
trial, the onset of movement  cue was deﬁned  as the time 0 s in the 
present  study ( Fig. 1 A). During the experiment,  all subjects  were in their 
normal  cognitive  state without  epileptic  seizure onset. The subjects  per- 
formed  the task using the hand contralateral  to the hemisphere  with the 
majority  of the implanted  SEEG electrodes  (Left hand: 14 subjects;  Right 
hand: 18 subjects).

rodevelopmental  outcomes  reported  in preterm  children  ( Saigal and 
Doyle, 2008 ). 
Key magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) studies have reported  al- 
tered brain volumes  in very preterm  (VP; < 32 weeks’ gestational  age) 
infants,  children  and adolescents  compared  with full-term  (FT) controls,  
including  in frontal,  occipital,  temporal,  and cingulate  cortical  GM re- 
gions ( de Kieviet et al., 2012 ; Hadaya  and Nosarti,  2020 ; Keunen  et al., 
2012 ; Zhou et al., 2018 ). However,  brain volume  per se does not reﬂect 
the microstructural  brain properties  aﬀected  by VP birth. Thus, diﬀusion-  
weighted  MRI data has been analysed  using the diﬀusion  tensor imaging  
(DTI) model, identifying  altered microstructure  in widespread  periven-  
tricular  and non-periventricular  WM regions  in VP infants,  children  and 
adolescents  compared  with FT controls  ( Dibble et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 
2015 ; Pandit et al., 2013 ). Despite  being commonly  used, DTI measures  
provide  limited information  on biological  mechanisms  underlying  re- 
ported ﬁndings,  as they are not speciﬁc  to particular  microstructural  
properties  and are confounded  by extra-axonal  signal and ﬁbre geome-  
try ( Jones et al., 2013 ). Some recent studies applied  advanced  diﬀusion  
MRI models and analysis  frameworks  such as Neurite  Orientation  Dis- 
persion  and Density  Imaging  (NODDI)  ( Kelly et al., 2016 ; Young et al., 
2019 ) and ﬁxel-based  analysis  ( Kelly et al., 2020 ; Pannek  et al., 2018 ; 
Pecheva  et al., 2019 ), showing  VP birth is associated  more speciﬁcally  
with reduced  WM axon density  in many WM ﬁbre tracts. 
Thus, as described  above, prior diﬀusion  MRI studies in VP-born  chil- 
dren have commonly  focussed  on the microstructure  of the WM, with 
relatively  fewer studies also investigating  other measures  such as free- 
water content  in the WM, and in other regions  such as the cortical  GM, 
in VP-born  children.  These biophysical  properties  of the brain change 
rapidly  during fetal and neonatal  brain development  ( Ouyang  et al., 
2019 ), and therefore  such properties  are likely adversely  aﬀected  by VP 
birth. Recent diﬀusion  MRI advancements,  such as Single-Shell  3-Tissue  
Constrained  Spherical  Deconvolution  (SS3T-CSD),  enable investigation  
of brain WM and cortical  GM microstructure  and free-water  properties  
( Dhollander  and Connelly,  2016 ). SS3T-CSD  has been applied  to study 
the microstructural  and free-water  properties  of typically  developing  
brain tissue ( Dhollander  et al., 2019a ), and pathological  tissue in neu- 
rodegenerative  diseases  ( Khan et al., 2020 ; Khan et al., 2021 ; Mito et al., 
2020 ). In these applications,  tissue is characterised  in terms of its rel- 
ative composition  of “WM-like  ”( T W ), “GM-like  ”( T G ), and “CSF-like  ”
(T C , i.e., free-water)  diﬀusion  signal characteristics.  For example,  during 
typical neonatal  brain development,  a relative  increase  in WM-like  sig- 
nal and decrease  in CSF-like  signal occurs in cerebral  WM regions;  this 
temporally  corresponds  to microstructural  axonal and myelin develop-  
ment accompanied  by decreasing  free-water  content  in the cerebral  WM 
( Dhollander  et al., 2019a ). It is important  to note that, while these dif- 
fusion signal representations  are calibrated  by the three key diﬀusion  
patterns  of WM, GM and CSF, they do not imply biological  similarity.  
For example,  in neurodegenerative  diseases,  increases  in “GM-like  ”(T G ) 
signal have been observed  in cerebral  WM lesions ( Khan et al., 2020 ; 
Khan et al., 2021 ; Mito et al., 2020 ): the relative  shift from a “WM-like  ”
(T W ) signal to a more “GM-like  ”(T G ) signal in these WM lesions is com- 
patible with axon and myelin loss and gliosis, which shares no biological  
resemblance  to GM, yet from a diﬀusion  signal point of view eﬀectively  
indicates  slightly  increased  diﬀusivity  and decreased  anisotropy.  
The eﬀect of VP birth on these three-tissue  compositions  (T W , T G and 
T C ) has not been investigated.  Application  of three-tissue  compositions  
would complement  and expand  prior research  to provide  information  on 
microstructure  and free-water  content  of the WM and cortical  GM in VP- 
born children  and adolescents.  In the current  study, we aimed to inves- 
tigate eﬀects of VP birth on brain WM and GM microstructural  and free- 
water properties  at age 13 years. As the three-tissue  compositions  have 
previously  been analysed  speciﬁcally  in WM regions  ( Khan et al., 2020 ; 
Khan et al., 2021 ; Mito et al., 2020 ), we employed  a bespoke  approach  to 
analyse  the three-tissue  compositions  across the whole-brain  via a voxel- 
based analysis  (VBA). Additionally,  given there have been relatively  few 
prior studies of cortical  microstructure  in VP children  and adolescents,  we detailed  the three-tissue  compositions  in cortical  regions-of-interest  
(ROIs). We hypothesised  that disruption  to early brain development  by 
VP birth is associated  with widespread  reduced  microstructural  density  
(i.e., reduced  T W in the WM and reduced  T G in the cortical  GM) and 
increased  free-water  content  (i.e., increased  T C in the same WM and 
cortical  GM regions)  later in childhood  (at age 13 years). Additionally,  
we hypothesise  these patterns  of tissue composition  alterations  are more 
pronounced  following  neonatal  brain injury and abnormalities,  and are 
related to adverse  neurodevelopmental  outcomes  in VP children.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participant  recruitment  
Infants born VP ( < 30 weeks’ gestation  or < 1250 g) were recruited  be- 
tween July 2001 and December  2003 from the Royal Women’s  Hospital,  
Melbourne  (a total of n = 224 VP infants were recruited).  Control  infants 
born FT ( ≥ 37 weeks’ gestation)  were also recruited  (a total of n = 76 FT 
infants were recruited).  Infants with genetic  or congenital  abnormalities  
were excluded.  All participants  were invited to return for assessments,  
including  MRI, at 13 years of age. Brain volumes  and WM microstruc-

2.2. Perinatal  data collection  
Extensive  data were collected  in the perinatal  period and were used 
in the current  study for the purpose  of correlating  with brain tissue com- 
position  data at age 13 years. These perinatal  data included  the follow- 
ing variables:  gestational  age at birth; sex; birth weight standardised  for 
gestational  age and sex (birth weight z-score)  ( Cole et al., 1998 ); ma- 
jor neonatal  brain injuries  (intraventricular  haemorrhage  ( Papile et al., 
1978 ) and cystic periventricular  leukomalacia,  which were diagnosed  by 
serial cranial ultrasound  prior to term-equivalent  age in the VP group);  
neonatal  infection  (which was deﬁned  as the presence  of sepsis and/or 
proven necrotizing  enterocolitis);  neonatal  brain abnormalities  (which 
were assessed  from MRI at term-equivalent  age, i.e., 38-42 weeks’ post- 
menstrual  age, using an established  scoring  system ( Kidokoro  et al., 
2013 )). The neonatal  cranial ultrasound  and the neonatal  MRI variables  
were analysed  separately.

mechanisms  underlying  these interference  eﬀects can provide  insights  
into characteristic  deviations,  as for example  occurring  in advanced  age 
or during neurodegenerative  diseases  where uncertainties  in estimated  
time and distance  frequently  occur (e.g., Kuehn et al., 2018 ; Maaßet  al., 
2022 ; Mioni et al., 2021 ; Riemer  et al., 2021 ; Stangl et al., 2020 ). 
A potential  neuronal  mechanism  for the interference  between  travel 
time and traveled  distance  consists  in the processing  of speed, because  
both time and distance  judgments  can be solved on the basis of speed 
representations,  combined  with information  about the respective  other 
dimension.  If the perceptual  interference  between  time and distance  
originates  from common  neuronal  representations  of speed, this should 
be reﬂected  in high representational  similarity  during time and distance  
judgments  in speed-sensitive  brain regions,  such as area hMT + and pos- 
terior parietal  regions  ( Britten,  2008 ; Duﬀy and Wurtz, 1997 ; Martinez-  
Trujillo  et al., 2007 ; Wurtz, 1998 ). 
To test whether  behavioural  interferences  between  travel time and 
traveled  distance  are associated  with common  representations  of speed, 
we compared  the interference  between  time and distance  with the in- 
terference  between  each of these magnitudes  and numerosity  (i.e., the 
amount  of dots randomly  appearing  along a path during visual forward  
motion).  Twenty-ﬁve  participants  underwent  fMRI scanning  while ex- 
periencing  visual forward  motion along a virtual linear track, with their 
attention  being directed  either to the duration  of the forward  movement,  
the traversed  distance,  or the number  of events encountered  during the 
movement.  To eliminate  confounds  driven by sensory  diﬀerences,  visual 
stimuli were identical  across all conditions.  We employed  an adaptive  
design and tested all participants  around their individual  50% perfor- 
mance threshold  in each task, thereby  controlling  for confounds  of task 
diﬃculty  ( Livesey  et al., 2007 ; Tregellas  et al., 2006 ). Finally,  we con- 
trolled for stimulus  repetition  and adaptation  eﬀects by using a speciﬁc  
randomization  sequence  ( Aguirre,  2007 ). 
Representational  similarity  analysis  (RSA) served to investigate  the 
neuronal  basis for the perceptual  interference  between  travel time and 
traveled  distance  in the human brain. Speciﬁcally,  if cross-dimensional  
interference  at the behavioral  level between  time and distance  is medi- 
ated by common  neuronal  representations  of speed, interference  should 
be larger when representational  similarity  in speed-sensitive  areas is 
high. To the best of our knowledge,  this is the ﬁrst study that used a 
combined  fMRI-behavioral  paradigm  to systematically  investigate  the 
neuronal  mechanisms  that underlie  perceptual  interference  eﬀects be- 
tween travel time and traveled  distance.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-ﬁve  right-handed  participants  were recruited  from the local 
community  (14 females  and 11 males, mean age: 24.9 years, ranging  
from 20 to 41 years). Required  sample size of 22 ( 𝛼= 0.05; 1- 𝛽= 0.80) 
was calculated  with G ∗ Power ( Faul et al., 2007 ), based on eﬀect sizes 
reported  in Riemer  et al. (2018) . Exclusion  criteria  were contraindica-  
tions to magnetic  resonance  imaging,  such as metallic  objects in the 
body, or tinnitus.  The data of one participant  were excluded  from the 
analysis  due to missed responses  in more than 20% of the trials, casting 
doubt on overall attention.  All participants  received  monetary  compen-  
sation and gave written  informed  consent  to the experimental  protocol,  
which was approved  by the local ethics committee  of the University  of 
Magdeburg.  
2.2. Experimental  design 
2.2.1. Stimuli,  tasks and trial order 
In a path integration  paradigm  we probed cross-dimensional  inter- 
ferences  between  travel time and traveled  distance,  and compared  them 
to the interference  between  each of these magnitudes  and numerosity  (the amount  of items encountered  during walking).  In our experimental  
design, visual input was identical  between  the tested dimensions,  that 
is, participants  always saw a virtual linear track projected  onto a screen 
along which they were passively  moved forward  (see Fig. 1 ). Optic ﬂow 
information  was provided  by the textures  of the track and the grassy 
landscape  alongside.  To prevent  participants  from ﬁxating  speciﬁc  loca- 
tions at the far end of the track (and instead  force them to continuously  
integrate  the accumulating  distance  information),  viewing  distance  was 
limited by gray fog that linearly  increased  in density,  starting  one meter 
in front of the participant.  In diﬀerent  experimental  conditions,  only the 
instruction  varied, indicating  to the participant  which one of four dimen- 
sions (i.e., time, distance,  numerosity,  luminance)  they had to attend to 
in each trial. Numerosity  trials served as a control condition  involving  
an accumulation  process  for a diﬀerent  magnitude  (i.e., numerosity).  
Luminance  trials were chosen as a control condition  involving  only the 
decision  component,  in which the critical dimension  (i.e., luminance)  
did not accumulate  over the course of the trial. 
In each trial, one of four task symbols  (i.e., time, distance,  nu- 
merosity  or luminance)  was presented  for 500 ms (see Fig. 1 ). After 
an interstimulus-interval  (ISI; randomised  between  2 and 3 s), during 
which a blank screen was shown, a path was displayed  and the observer  
was passively  moved forward.  Movement  speed varied between  trials, 
but was kept constant  within each trial. Across trials, the covered  dis- 
tance was either 11.5 or 19.7 m (distance),  and the travel time was 
either 2.8 or 4.8 s (time). During the forward  motion,  either 45 or 77 
white dots (numerosity)  ﬂashed  on the path. The dots did not ﬂash all 
at once but in an irregular  manner,  so that their total sum accumulated  
until the end of the forward  motion.  200 ms before the forward  mo- 
tion was terminated  by a black screen, a gray square of either 16 or 
28 pct white content  (luminance)  appeared  in the middle of the screen. 
All levels of these four dimensions  were combined  equally  with each 
other, resulting  in 16 diﬀerent  combinations.  After an ISI of 1 s, a com- 
parison  number  was displayed  on the screen and the participants  had 
to perform  a two-alternative  forced-choice  task. In time trials, partic- 
ipants indicated  via button press whether  the travel time was shorter 
or longer than this comparison  number  in seconds.  In distance  trials, 
they indicated  whether  the traveled  distance  was shorter or longer than 
this comparison  number  in meters.  In numerosity  trials, they indicated  
whether  the number  of ﬂashed  dots was smaller  or larger than this com- 
parison  number.  Comparison  numbers  were integers  in numerosity  trials 
and had one decimal  during time and distance  trials. Finally,  in lumi- 
nance trials, the comparison  value consisted  of a displayed  square with 
variable  white content,  and participants  indicated  whether  the square 
presented  at the end of the forward  motion was darker or brighter  than 
this comparison  square.  
Responses  were given with the index ﬁnger (‘less’) or the middle ﬁn- 
ger (‘more’)  of the right hand, and participants  had 2 s time to respond.  
If no response  was given within this time window,  a message  ‘Please 
respond  faster!’ was displayed  in red letters for 0.5 s. Participants  had 
the option to indicate  that they had forgotten  the cue (indicating  the 
relevant  dimension  for the current  trial) by pressing  the thumb key. No 
feedback  was provided  throughout  the whole experiment.  
The experiment  was composed  of four diﬀerent  trial types (each pre- 
sented 100 times) plus 100 null trials, in which a ﬁxation  cross was 
presented  on a gray background.  To account  for possible  repetition  ef- 
fects, all trials were ordered  according  to a continuous  carryover  se- 
quence ( Aguirre,  2007 ). This second-order  counterbalanced  sequence  
ensured  that each trial type (including  null trials) was preceded  by ev- 
ery other trial type (including  itself) for an equal number  of times. One 
de Bruijn sequence  balancing  ﬁve conditions  at the second order in- 
cluded 125 trials. This sequence  was split in half (i.e., 63 and 62 trials) 
and distributed  over two separate  scan runs. To retain the circularity  
of de Bruijn sequences,  the ﬁnal two trials of each run were added to 
the start of the corresponding  run, resulting  in 65 or 64 trials per run 
(cf. Fig. 1 C).

Fig. 1. Experimental  design. (A) Each trial began with 
the presentation  of a cue, which informed  participants  
about the dimension  (time, distance,  numerosity,  lumi- 
nance) they had to attend to. Next, a gray linear track 
surrounded  by green grass was shown, and the observer  
experienced  a passive forward  movement  along the path. 
The covered distance  was either 11.5 or 19.7 m, travel 
time was either 2.8 or 4.8 s, and either 45 or 77 white dots 
appeared  on the ground. During the last 200 ms of each 
forward  motion, a gray square of either 16 or 28 pct white 
content appeared  on the screen. Once the forward  motion 
had ended, participants  had to judge whether  the magni- 
tude in question  was smaller or larger than a presented  
comparison  value. (B) The four symbols  used to inform 
participants  about the trial type at the start of each trial. 
(C) The task was performed  in eight runs, on two diﬀer- 
ent days. Two subsequent  runs comprised  a complete  de 
Bruijn sequence  (5 3 = 125 elements),  which was equal for 
all four runpairs.  Relative  to the original sequence  in run 
1–2, the level of travel time (short/long)  was switched  for 
all trials in run 3–4, for even trials in run 5–6, and for odd 
trials in run 7–8 (indicated  by red numbers).  
Furthermore,  we balanced  the trials with respect to (short and long) 
travel times, because  those diﬀered  in their total duration  (10.8 and 
12.8 s). 1 This was achieved  by repeating  the two runs (containing  one 
complete  de Bruijn sequence)  four times. In the ﬁrst repetition,  short and 
long trials were inverted  (i.e., each short trial from the original  sequence  
was changed  to a long trial and vice versa). In the second repetition,  only 
even trials from the original  sequence  were inverted,  and in the third 
repetition,  only odd trials were inverted.  This procedure  ensured  that 
the order of short and long trials was balanced.  The resulting  eight runs 
were conducted  in two separate  sessions  on two diﬀerent  testing days 
(maximally  one month apart). Each session lasted about 75 min. 
2.2.2. Task diﬃculty  
To maintain  comparable  levels of task diﬃculty  across the four tasks 
for each participant,  and over the course of the experiment,  an adaptive  
procedure  was employed  when selecting  comparison  numbers  (or, in lu- 
minance  trials, the white content  of the comparison  square):  Depending  
on the response  (‘less’ or ‘more’) in the previous  trial involving  the same 
standard  (e.g., a time trial with 4.8 s), the new comparison  value was 
randomly  chosen from a range of zero to 1 
4 times below or above this 
previous  value, respectively.  The ﬁrst comparison  value was randomly  
chosen between  1 
4 times below to 1 
4 times above the respective  standard  
value. 
Finally,  after each run, participants  rated the diﬃculty  of the four 
diﬀerent  tasks on a visual analogue  scale (balanced  order) via button 
1 Although  ISIs between  cue and passive forward  motion were jittered, the 
temporal  diﬀerences  were compensated  for during the ITIs, so that each trial 
was either 10.8 s or 12.8 s in duration.  press. Participants  used the index and middle ﬁnger keys to move a 
marker  along an easy-diﬃcult  continuum  and conﬁrmed  their response  
with the thumb key.

precision  of articulatory  prediction  ( Karas et al., 2019 ). Magnetoen-  
cephalography  (MEG) and electroencephalogram  (EEG) studies on con- 
tinuous  speech have shown that visual speech improves  the neural track- 
ing of speech envelope  ( Crosse et al., 2015 ; Giordano  et al., 2017 ), 
and facilitates  the neural encoding  of both spectrotemporal  and pho- 
netic features  of speech ( O’Sullivan  et al., 2021 ). The visual beneﬁt 
on neural tracking  of speech was stronger  under noisy conditions  than 
quiet conditions,  demonstrating  the inverse  eﬀectiveness  in audiovisual  
speech processing  ( Crosse et al., 2016 ). Despite  the limitation  of spa- 
tial resolution,  recent MEG studies started to locate the brain regions  
involved  in the visual enhancement  of speech encoding,  including  the 
left motor cortex and inferior  frontal gyrus (IFG) ( Giordano  et al., 2017 ; 
Keitel et al., 2020 ). The left posterior  superior  temporal  gyrus/sulcus  
(pSTG/S)  has been implicated  as another  critical region in audiovisual  
speech integration  in functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) 
studies ( Erickson  et al., 2014 ; Nath and Beauchamp,  2011 ) and intracra-  
nial EEG studies ( Karas et al., 2019 ; Micheli  et al., 2020 ). However,  the 
left pSTG/S  is recently  found to represent  the common  redundant  fea- 
tures of the bimodal  signals,  whereas  left speech motor areas represent  
the synergistic  feature of them ( Park et al., 2018 ). Moreover,  the neu- 
ral entrainment  to lip movements  in the left motor cortex ( Park et al., 
2016 ) and enhanced  eﬀective  connectivity  between  frontal motor and 
temporal  cortices  ( Giordano  et al., 2017 ) were correlated  with the vi- 
sual beneﬁt on speech comprehension.  Those ﬁndings  are consistent  
with the neuroanatomical  models suggesting  that the dorsal stream of 
speech processing,  including  the left pSTG/S,  inferior  parietal  lobule 
(IPL, composed  of supramarginal  gyrus (SMG) and angular  gyrus (AG)), 
and frontal speech motor areas (IFG and premotor/motor  cortex),  is 
involved  in integrating  visual and auditory  speech in addition  to au- 
ditory and visual cortices  ( Bernstein  and Liebenthal,  2014 ; Keil and 
Senkowski,  2018 ; Rauschecker,  2018 ). Considering  that frontal speech 
motor areas are engaged  to a higher extent in adverse  listening  con- 
ditions to provide  articulatory  predictions  to compensate  for degraded  
bottom-up  speech processing  ( Alain et al., 2018 ; Du et al., 2016 , 2014 ; 
Nuttall et al., 2016 ; Pickering  and Garrod,  2013 ; Skipper  et al., 2017 ), 
we hypothesized  that visual lip movements  would promote  functional  
activities  mainly along the dorsal stream when speech is degraded  by 
noise. Also, we are interested  in whether  visual speech cues would shape 
neural representations  of phonemes  and articulatory-phonetic  features  
diﬀerentially  in distinct  dorsal regions  and how the network  connectiv-  
ity would be changed  accordingly.  
This fMRI study aimed to explore  whether  and how visual lip move- 
ments improved  speech processing  along the auditory  dorsal stream 
when subjects  discriminated  audiovisual  consonant-vowel  syllables  un- 
der diﬀerent  signal-to-noise  ratios (SNRs).  We employed  regions-of-  
interest  (ROI)-based  multivariate  pattern  analysis  (MVPA)  to investi-  
gate whether  and where visual lip movements  promoted  neural rep- 
resentations  of phonemes  and distinct  articulatory  features.  Then, dy- 
namic causal modeling  (DCM) analysis  was performed  to examine  the 
visual impact on eﬀective  connectivity  along the dorsal pathway.  Lastly, 
we used state-of-art  neurite  orientation  dispersion  and density  imaging  
(NODDI)  technique  to quantify  the ﬁne-grained  microstructural  neurite  
morphology  of the left arcuate  fasciculus  (AF), which is a critical white 
matter ﬁber tract connecting  Broca’s  and Wernicke’s  areas, to further 
exam the anatomical-functional  correlation  along the dorsal stream.  By 
doing so, we expected  to ﬁll the gap of linking local neural representa-  
tions at diﬀerent  speech hierarchies,  functional  network  dynamics,  and 
ﬁber microstructure  architecture  in the auditory  dorsal stream underly-  
ing audiovisual  speech perception  in an integrative  manner.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-four  young adults (19–28 years old, 12 females)  participated  
in this study. All participants  were healthy,  right-handed,  native Chinese  speakers  with no history of neurological  disorder  and normal  hearing  
(average  pure-tone  threshold  < 20 dB HL for 250 to 8000 Hz) at both 
ears. All participants  had signed the written  consent  approved  by the 
Institute  of Psychology,  Chinese  Academy  of Sciences.  
2.2. Experimental  design 
The stimuli comprised  4 naturally  pronounced  consonant-vowel  syl- 
lables (/ba/, /da/, /pa/, /ta/) uttered  by a young Chinese  female.  The 4 
syllables  have 2 orthogonal  articulatory  features,  voicing  (voiced:  /ba/ 
and /da/; unvoiced:  /pa/ and /ta/) and place of articulation  (bilabial:  
/ba/ and /pa/; lingua-dental:  /da/ and /ta/). The utterances  were video- 
taped by a Sony FDR-AX45  camera  in a soundproof  room. Then, they 
were digitized  and edited on the computer  to produce  a 1 s video. Video 
digitizing  was done at 29.97 frames/s  in 1024 ×768 pixels. The pictures  
of the videos were cut, retaining  the mouth and the neck part. The au- 
dio syllable  stimuli were nearly 400 ms in duration,  aligned  in time 
by lip movement  onset (started  around the 10th frame of the video), 
low-pass  ﬁltered  (4-kHz),  and matched  for average  root-mean-square  
sound pressure  level (SPL). The masker  was a speech spectrum-shaped  
noise (4-kHz low-pass,  10-ms rise–decay  envelope)  that was represen-  
tative of the spectrum  of 113 diﬀerent  sentences  by 50 Chinese  young 
female speakers.  The speech stimuli were presented  at 90 dB SPL, and 
the SPL of the maskers  was adjusted  to produce  diﬀerent  signal-to-noise  
ratios (SNRs) ( − 8, 0, and 8 dB). Audio stimuli were presented  via MRI- 
compatible  Sensimetrics  S14 insert earphones  (Sensimetrics  Corpora-  
tion) with Comply  foam tips, which maximally  attenuate  scanner  noise 
by 40 dB. 
The experiment  was a 3 (SNR: − 8, 0 and 8 dB) ×2 (visual valid- 
ity: Lip Congruent  and Lip Static) factororial  design. As shown in Fig. 1 , 
congruent  lip movements  videos were presented  with the correspond-  
ing speech signals in the Lip Congruent  (LC) condition,  while static pic- 
tures with closed mouth (the ﬁrst frames of the congruent  videos)  were 
presented  with speech signals in the Lip Static (LS) condition.  In the 
fMRI scanner,  subjects  were instructed  to listen to the speech signals,  
watch the mouth on the screen, and identify  the syllables  by pressing  
the corresponding  button using their right-hand  ﬁngers (index to little 
ﬁngers in response  to /ba/, /da/, /pa/, and /ta/ in half of the subjects  
or the reverse  order in the other half). Each subject completed  4 blocks 
of LC conditions  and 4 blocks of LS conditions.  The conditions  were 
arranged  in an ABBA or BAAB order (A denotes  2 LC blocks and B de- 
notes 2 LS blocks),  which was counterbalanced  across participants.  For 
example,  an ABBA sequence  refers to a LC/LC/LS/LS/LS/LS/LC/LC  se- 
quence.  Each block contained  60 stimuli (20 trials ×3 SNRs), which 
were pseudo-randomly  presented  with an average  inter-stimuli-interval  
of 5 s (4–6 s, 0.5 s step). Stimuli  were presented  via Psychtoolbox  
( Brainard,  1997 ).

2.1. Participants  
32 patients  with a chronic,  acquired  left hemispheric  brain lesion 
participated  in the study (age: mean ± SD = 51.9 ± 11.51 years, [range:  
25–76],  16 females).  The aetiologies  comprised  vascular  but also other 
CNS-diseases  leading  to a circumscribed  brain lesion. 2 Patients  were se- 
lected from a data bank of the Clinic for Cognitive  Neurology  (Univer-  
sity Hospital  Leipzig)  and the Max-Planck-Institute  for Human  Cognitive  
and Brain Sciences.  Exclusion  criteria  were additional  right-hemispheric  
lesions and severe overall cognitive  impairment.  Additional  cognitive  
impairments  were rated based on a detailed  assessment  of experienced  
neuropsychologists  to exclude  severe attentional,  overarching  memory  
and executive  deﬁcits.  Aphasia  was diagnosed  based on the standard  
German  assessment  battery  (Aachener  Aphasie  Test, AAT, Huber et al., 
1984 ); patients  with residual  or no aphasia  at the time of inclusion  had 
all been documented  to show an aphasic  deﬁcit at an earlier stage of 
the disease  ( Supplemental  Material  SM1 for demographic  and clinical  
2 Although  selective  inclusion  of ischemic  stroke survivors  is sometimes  con- 
sidered the best choice for lesion-behaviour  analyses,  we deliberately  deviate 
from this assumption.  Ischemic  strokes result from a heterogeneous  underlying  
pathology  (e.g. cardiogenic  vs. generalized  angiopathy)  and show preferential  
aﬀection  of speciﬁc vascular  territories.  We do not claim to fully control for 
this bias but suggest that a broader spectrum  of lesion site preference  related 
to diverse aetiologies  attenuates  this problem.  A second general caveat of all 
lesion-behavior  approaches,  especially  with vascular  pathologies,  results from 
the fact that a large proportion  of such patients  show ‘unspeciﬁc’  white mat- 
ter lesions, whose potential  functional  signiﬁcance  reduces the straightforward  
lesion-behavior  assignment.  Inclusion  of younger  participants  with lesions re- 
sulting from e.g. the removal  of a low-grade  glioma or stable disease neoplasm  
may attenuate  this general methodological  limitation.  Table 1

SUVRs in the hippocampus.  The CerebWM  was negatively  correlated  with all target regions (slope < -0.02, R 2 > 0.8). 
While no other correlations  between  OFF and target regions were found, hemisWM  was correlated  with all OFF 
regions but the cerebWM  (slopes 0.06-0.33).  HemisWM  correlations  attenuated  (slopes < 0.06) when applying  
two-compartment  PVC, but the hippocampus-ChPlex  and the cerebWM  correlations  required  more complex  PVC 
with dedicated  compartments  for these regions. In-vivo, PVC removed  a notably higher fraction of the correlation  
between  OFF regions found to be aﬀected  by PVE in the simulation  studies and BA ( ≈50%) than for OFF regions 
not aﬀected  by PVE (16%). 
Conclusion:  HemisWM  is the main driver of spill-in eﬀects in FTP PET, aﬀecting  both target regions and the rest 
of OFF regions. PVC successfully  reduces PVE, even when using a simple two-compartment  method.  Despite PVC, 
non-zero  correlations  were still observed  between  target and OFF regions in vivo, which suggests  the existence  
of biological  or tracer-related  contributions  to these correlations.  
1. Background  
In recent years, Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET) has become  
a reference  tool for the diagnosis  and monitoring  of Alzheimer’s  dis- 
ease (AD), mainly due to the emergence  of radiotracers  targeting  ex- 
tracellular  amyloid-beta  (A 𝛽) plaques  and intraneuronal  tau neuroﬁb-  
rillary tangles (NFTs) ( Schöll et al., 2016 ; Schultz  et al., 2018 ). Speciﬁ-  
cally, [ 18 F]Flortaucipir  (FTP, also referred  to as [ 18 F]T807  or [ 18 F]AV- 
1451) has been adopted  for detecting  pathological  tau accumulation  
in AD patients  ( Chien et al., 2013 ; Leuzy et al., 2019 ) due to its high 
aﬃnity  for 3R/4R tau isoforms  characteristic  of AD ( Xia et al., 2013 ). 
FTP has shown high sensitivity  and speciﬁcity  in discriminating  AD pa- 
tients from healthy  controls  (HC) and in monitoring  disease  progres-  
sion ( Johnson  et al., 2016 ; Maass et al., 2017 ; Ossenkoppele  et al., 
2018 ; Schöll et al., 2016 ; Schrouﬀ et  al., 2013 ; Schwarz  et al., 2016 ; 
Wang et al., 2016 ). Furthermore,  FTP PET staging  schemes  were found 
to match those previously  established  in post-mortem  studies ( Braak and 
Braak, 1991 ; Chen et al., 2021 ; Schwarz  et al., 2018 ). PET staging  
methods  are typically  based on the quantiﬁcation  of standardized  up- 
take value ratios (SUVR)  in Braak Areas (BA ROIs) ( Chen et al., 2021 ) 
and have been proven successful  for in-vivo staging  of AD patients  
( Schöll et al., 2016 ). 
Nevertheless,  FTP PET quantiﬁcation  still poses challenges  related 
to PET imaging  noise and limited resolution,  which cause variability  
and partial volume  eﬀects (PVE), respectively.  Due to the limited reso- 
lution of PET scanners  (typically  in the range of 3-6 mm), the detected  
counts are commonly  spread across adjacent  regions  ( Aston et al., 2002 ). 
These exchanges  of counts caused by PVE are also referred  to as spill- 
out (or -in) eﬀects ( Lu et al., 2021 ). Despite  FTP having shown high 
speciﬁcity  for AD tau pathology,  several brain areas have also been re- 
ported to exhibit unspeciﬁc  oﬀ-target  binding  (OFF), such as the white 
matter,  basal ganglia,  choroid  plexus or blood vessels,  among others 
( Chandra  et al., 2019 ; Lowe et al., 2016 ). Due to PVE, counts from 
these OFF regions  can spread into cortical  ROIs and alter SUVR mea- 
surements  ( Hoﬀman  et al., 1979 ). These eﬀects become  more severe as 
AD progresses  due to cortical  atrophy  ( Gonzalez-Escamilla  et al., 2017 ). 
In a previous  work ( Baker et al., 2019 ), the authors  investigated  the re- 
lationship  between  OFF and cortical  binding  in 90 A 𝛽-negative  healthy  
controls  (HC A 𝛽- ), reporting  that cortical  SUVR measurements  are heav- 
ily inﬂuenced  by OFF. Furthermore,  the authors  applied  a novel PVE 
correction  (PVC) technique  to correct for PVE of the most relevant  OFF 
regions  in FTP and reported  that PVC cannot remove  all the OFF-BA  
signal correlation.  These remaining  correlations  may be explained  by 
several factors such as the presence  of biological  or tracer-related  corre- 
lations between  uptake in diﬀerent  OFF regions  and disease  progression  
( Moscoso  et al., 2021 ), or by technical  factors such as PVC not being 
able to correct for all PVE. Nevertheless,  discerning  between  technical  
and biological  contributions  to this correlation  is inherently  challeng-  
ing, and further investigation  on the eﬀects of OFF may play a vital role 
in determining  the clinical  utility of FTP ( Roy et al., 2021 ). 
In the present  work we perform  a systematic  study of the con- 
tribution  of spill-in counts from OFF regions  to FTP PET SUVR quantiﬁcation,  isolating  technical  from biological  or tracer-related  ef- 
fects. To achieve  this, we analysed  FTP PET data from a large sample 
of 309 HC A 𝛽- subjects  from the Alzheimer’s  Disease  Neuroimaging  Ini- 
tiative (ADNI, adni.loni.usc.edu)  and the Harvard  Aging Brain Study 
(HABS,  habs.mgh.harvard.edu)  together  with a large set of synthetic  
images generated  using a well-controlled  Monte Carlo (MC) simulation  
framework  ( Paredes-Pacheco  et al., 2021 ). This strategy  allowed  for the 
generation  of realistic  FTP PET images derived  from real patient data 
that included  diﬀerent  levels of spill-in counts from OFF regions,  pro- 
viding an estimation  of the magnitude  of purely technical  contributions  
to PVE. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Subject data 
Data used in the preparation  of this article were obtained  from the 
ADNI and HABS databases.  The ADNI was launched  in 2003 as a public- 
private partnership,  led by Principal  Investigator  Michael  W. Weiner,  
MD. The primary  goal of ADNI has been to test whether  serial magnetic  
resonance  imaging  (MRI), PET, other biological  markers,  and clinical  
and neuropsychological  assessment  can be combined  to measure  the 
progression  of mild cognitive  impairment  (MCI) and early AD. HABS 
was started in 2010, funded by the National  Institute  of Aging and led 
by Principal  Investigators  Reisa A. Sperling,  MD and Keith A. Johnson,  
MD. 
Our cohort includes  309 HC A 𝛽- subjects  from ADNI and HABS who 
underwent  structural  MRI, A 𝛽PET and FTP PET scans, with A 𝛽negativ-  
ity deﬁned  as centiloid  12 or lower ( Klunk et al., 2015 ). Demographic  
characteristics  of the joint cohort are detailed  in Supplementary  Table 
1. In addition,  a subset of ten randomly  selected  ADNI subjects  acquired  
with the GE Discovery  ST (6 males and 4 females;  mean age: 78.98 ± 
6.42 yrs. range: 71.5-89.4  yrs) was used as input for the MC simulation  
framework  following  the methodology  described  below (detailed  infor- 
mation about these subjects  is provided  in Supplementary  Table 2). 
2.2. Image Acquisition  
ADNI FTP PET images were acquired  using dynamic  3D acquisi-  
tions of six 5-min frames starting  75 minutes  after the injection  of 
370 MBq ± 10% of FTP. Every image was reviewed  for protocol  
compliance  by the ADNI PET Quality  Control  team. For this work, 
we used images in pre-processing  levels two and four as described  
by ADNI ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis-method/pet-  
analysis/  ), which corresponds  to co-registered  and averaged  images 
(level two), further reoriented  to a standard  image matrix and smoothed  
to 8 mm isotropic  resolution  (level four). Level four is used throughout  
this study unless stated otherwise.

HABS FTP PET images were acquired  using dynamic  3D acquisitions  
after the injection  of 370 MBq ± 10% of FTP. Acquisition  varies between  
four 5-min frames starting  at 80 min post-injection  and six 5-min frames 
starting  at 75 min post-injection.  Static PET images were then obtained  
by realigning  and averaging  the acquired  frames and reslicing  the im- 
ages to the ADNI standard  voxel size of 1.5 mm. Afterwards,  an isotropic  
Gaussian  ﬁlter of FWHM 5 mm was applied  to harmonize  the images to 
the ADNI standard  resolution  of 8 mm. 
T1 structural  scans from ADNI and HABS were acquired  on 3T scan- 
ners using an accelerated  sagittal  MPRAGE  sequence  with a spatial reso- 
lution of 1 cubic millimeter  (mm 3 ). Each series in each exam underwent  
quality control following  the steps described  in detail in ADNI’s MRI pro- 
tocol ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-tool/mri-analysis/  ).

the intra-axonal  axial diﬀusivity,  i.e. the diﬀusion  of water molecules  
inside the axon as they travel along the primary  axis or orientation,  is 
a ﬁxed, global value known a priori and typically  set to 1 . 7 μm 2 /ms . 
An axial diﬀusivity  of 1 . 7 μm 2 /ms has been previously  justiﬁed  in adult 
white matter by minimising  the model residuals  when ﬁtting to in vivo 
data from multiple  subjects  ( Guerreroid  et al., 2019 ). However,  optimis-  
ing over the residuals  may be sub-optimal  for a degenerate  model like 
NODDI,  where multiple  parameter  sets can produce  the same diﬀusion  
signal. This degeneracy  likely explains  the broad range of reported  ax- 
ial diﬀusivities  ( ∼1 − 2 . 5 μm 2 /ms ) with similar residual  error. Though  
these axial diﬀusivities  may produce  a similar residual  error, the esti- 
mated NODDI  parameters  from each ﬁt will be diﬀerent.  Furthermore,  
there now exists a body of work in which the intra-axonal  axial dif- 
fusivity  is generally  estimated  to be higher, typically  in the range of 
∼2 − 2 . 5 μm 2 /ms ( Dhital et al., 2019; Jelescu  and Budde, 2017; Jelescu  
et al., 2020; 2016; Kaden et al., 2016; Kunz et al., 2018; Lampinen  
et al., 2020; McKinnon  et al., 2018; Nilsson  et al., 2021; Ramanna  et al., 
2020; Zheng et al., 2017 ). Notably,  these studies use diﬀerent  meth- 
ods to achieve  compartment  speciﬁc  selectivity  (including  high b-value  
data ( McKinnon  et al., 2018; Veraart  et al., 2019 ), gadolinium  injec- 
tion ( Kunz et al., 2018 ) and planar ﬁltering  ( Dhital et al., 2019 )), as 
well as diﬀerent  microstructure  models and/or parameter  constraints  to 
estimate  axial diﬀusivity.  
Inspired  by the diﬀerence  between  the reported  and assumed  intra- 
axonal axial diﬀusivity,  this study ﬁrst aims to explore  how changing  
the predeﬁned  axial diﬀusivity  in the NODDI  model aﬀected  the remain-  
ing estimated  parameters.  A second aim of this study was to investigate  
whether,  by utilising  high b-value  data, we could simultaneously  esti- 
mate axial diﬀusivity  within the NODDI  framework.  Here it is useful 
to estimate  axial diﬀusivity  within the NODDI  framework  (rather than 
e.g, from the voxels with highest  fractional  anisotropy  ( Basser et al., 
1994 )) as it facilitates  estimation  of both axial diﬀusivity  and ﬁbre 
dispersion  on a voxelwise  basis. Were the ﬁbres instead  assumed  to 
be coherently  aligned,  the axial diﬀusivity  estimates  would be biased 
( Dhital et al., 2019; Howard  et al., 2019 ). Crucial  to our second aim 
was the use of ultra-high  b-value  data, where it can be assumed  that 
the higher-diﬀusivity  extra-axonal  water is eliminated  such that only 
the intra-axonal  compartment  contributes  signal ( Jensen et al., 2016; 
Kleban et al., 2020; Lundell  et al., 2021; McKinnon  et al., 2018; McK- 
innon and Jensen,  2019; McKinnon  et al., 2017; Novikov  et al., 2018a; 
Veraart  et al., 2019 ), thus overcoming  known degeneracies  between  dif- 
fusion characteristics  of the intra- and extra-axonal  space ( Howard  et al., 
2019 ). However,  high b-value  data also posed several challenges.  In par- 
ticular,  we found that in this low SNR regime,  the model had to account  
for both the rectiﬁed  noise ﬂoor and/or a signal oﬀset to avoid parame-  
ter degeneracy  and bias. We demonstrate  how, with appropriate  modi- 
ﬁcations,  the NODDI  framework  can be applied  to both magnitude  and 
real-valued  data to estimate  axial diﬀusivities  in line with previous  lit- 
erature.  
2. Methods  
This paper is organised  as follows.  First we demonstrate  how chang- 
ing the assumed  intra-axonal  axial diﬀusivity  aﬀects the output of the 
‘standard  NODDI  model’ (described  below),  highlighting  the importance  
of the discrepancy  between  the assumed  axial diﬀusivity  of NODDI  and 
many estimates  of axial diﬀusivity  found in literature.  We then investi-  
gate how a ‘modiﬁed  NODDI  model’ can be used to estimate  both the 
axial diﬀusivity  and ODI concurrently  from high b-value  data. Specif- 
ically, this modiﬁed  NODDI  model (i) considers  the intra-axonal  com- 
partment  only and (ii) explicitly  accounts  for Rician noise ﬂoor and a 
signal oﬀset. Finally,  the modiﬁed  model was applied  to in vivo, human 
data, where we explore  how noise can bias model estimates  in this high 
b-value  and thus low SNR regime.  2.1. NODDI output sensitivity  to the assumed  axial diﬀusivity  
To evaluate  how the NODDI  output changed  with respect to the as- 
sumed axial diﬀusivity,  the standard  NODDI  model ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) 
was applied  to the diﬀusion  data with 𝑑 ∥= 1 . 7 , 2 . 3 or 3 μm 2 /ms . Brieﬂy,  
the NODDI  model consists  of a Watson-like  ﬁbre orientation  distribu-  
tion which is convolved  with three compartments  that are typically  as- 
sociated  with the CSF, extra-axonal  and intra-axonal  space. The ﬁrst 
compartment  has isotropic,  free diﬀusion,  the second compartment  de- 
scribes tensor-like  diﬀusion,  and the third compartment  describes  stick- 
like diﬀusion.  The model ﬁtting involves  5 parameters  being estimated  
(the intra-axonal  signal fraction,  the isotropic  signal fraction,  the ﬁ- 
bre orientation  and orientation  dispersion  index, [ 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 , 𝑓 𝑖𝑠𝑜 , 𝜃, 𝜙, 𝑂𝐷𝐼] ) 
whilst assuming  some ﬁxed, global axial diﬀusivity  which may dif- 
fer from 𝑑 ∥= 1 . 7 μm 2 /ms , that the radial diﬀusivity  of the tensor-like  
compartment  is given by the tortuosity  model 𝑑 ⟂= 𝑑 ∥(1 − 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 ) and that 
the diﬀusivity  of the isotropic  compartment  is that of free diﬀusion  
𝑑 𝑖𝑠𝑜 = 3 μm 2 /ms . 
Here we utilised  preprocessed  T1-weighted  and diﬀusion-weighted  
data for the ﬁrst 10 subjects  of the WU-Minn  Human  Connectom  Project 
(HCP); for details of the acquisition  protocol  and preprocessing  pipeline,  
please see ( Glasser  et al., 2013; Sotiropoulos  et al., 2013; Van Essen 
et al., 2013 ). Brieﬂy,  the diﬀusion-weighted  data included  90 gradient  
directions  each at b-values  of 𝑏 = 1 , 2 and 3 ms/ μm 2 and 18 interspersed  
volumes  with negligible  diﬀusion  weighting.  The distortion  corrected  
(“pre-processed  ”) 𝑏 ∼0 ms/ 𝜇m 2 data were linearly  registered  to each 
subject’s  T1-weighted  structural  scan (FLIRT ( Jenkinson  et al., 2002; 
Jenkinson  and Smith, 2001 )), and the T1 non-linearly  registered  to the 
MNI standard  space (FNIRT  ( Andersson  et al., 2007; Woolrich  et al., 
2009 )). The NODDI  ﬁtting ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) was performed  in sub- 
ject space using the cuDIMOT  framework  ( Hernandez-Fernandez  et al., 
2019 ) for GPU acceleration  with Rician noise modelling.  
2.2. Modiﬁed  NODDI for high b-value data 
The NODDI  model was modiﬁed  for high b-value  data where we 
assume  the entirety  of the diﬀusion  signal can be attributed  to the intra- 
axonal compartment  ( Jensen et al., 2016; Kleban et al., 2020; Lundell  
et al., 2021; McKinnon  et al., 2018; McKinnon  and Jensen,  2019; McK- 
innon et al., 2017; Novikov  et al., 2018a; Veraart  et al., 2019 ). Here, the 
diﬀusion  signal along gradient  direction  𝒈 is given by the convolution  
of the ﬁbre orientation  distribution,  which was assumed  to be a Watson  
distribution  ( Mardia  and Jupp, 2000; Zhang et al., 2012 ), and a ﬁbre 
response  function  for stick-like  ﬁbres with Gaussian  axial diﬀusion  and 
no radial diﬀusion:  
𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ≈𝑓 𝑖𝑛 𝑆 0 1 
𝐶 𝑊 ∫𝑆 2 exp [ 𝜅( 𝝁⊤𝒙 ) 2 ] exp [ − 𝑏𝑑 ∥( 𝒈 ⊤𝒙 ) 2 ] d 𝑥 . (1) 
The integrand  is over 𝒙 ∈𝑆 2 ; 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 being the signal fraction  of the intra- 
axonal compartment;  𝝁( 𝜃, 𝜙) , the direction  of the ﬁbre; 𝑑 ∥, the intra- 
axonal axial diﬀusivity;  𝒙 , a unit vector on the sphere 𝑆 2 ; 𝑏 , the b-value  
and 𝑆 0 , the non-diﬀusion  weighted  signal. 𝐶 𝑊 is the normalising  con- 
stant, where, 
𝐶 𝑊 = ∫𝑆 2 exp [ 𝜅( 𝝁⊤𝒙 ) 2 ] d 𝑥 = 4 𝜋1 𝐹 1 (1∕2; 3∕2; 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤) , (2) 
and 1 𝐹 1 ( 𝛼; 𝛽; 𝑿 ) is the conﬂuent  hypergeometric  function  of the ﬁrst 
kind with a matrix argument  𝑿 . The dispersion  parameter  𝜅is typ- 
ically rewritten  in terms of the orientation  dispersion  index, 𝑂𝐷𝐼 = 
2∕ 𝜋arctan (1∕ 𝜅) ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) which ranges from 0 to 1, repre- 
senting  perfectly  aligned  and isotropic  ﬁbre distributions  respectively.  
The integral  in Eq. 1 can also be written  in terms of the conﬂu- 
ent hypergeometric  function  of the ﬁrst kind with matrix argument  
𝑋 = 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤− 𝑏𝑑 ∥𝒈𝒈 ⊤. Consequently,  Eq. 1 becomes  ( Sotiropoulos  et al., 
2012 ): 
𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ≈𝑓 𝑖𝑛 𝑆 0 1 𝐹 1 (1∕2; 3∕2; 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤− 𝑏𝑑 ∥𝒈𝒈 ⊤) 
1 𝐹 1 (1∕2; 3∕2; 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤) . (3) 
2  A.F. Howard, M. Cottaar, M. Drakesmith  et al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119535 
By taking the ratio of 𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ∕ 𝑆 𝑏 (rather than 𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ∕ 𝑆 0 ) we can derive an 
analytic  solution  where the model is independent  of both 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 and 𝑆 0 , 
and described  by only four parameters  𝑆( 𝑂𝐷𝐼, 𝑑 ∥, 𝜃, 𝜙) . 𝑆 𝑏 represents  
the powder  averaged  signal, i.e. the average  signal across all diﬀu- 
sion gradients  for a given b-value,  where at high b-value,  for stick- 
like diﬀusion  convolved  with an arbitrary  ﬁbre orientation  distribution  
Kaden et al. (2016) , 
𝑆 𝑏 ≈𝑓 𝑖𝑛 𝑆 0 √
𝜋erf ( √𝑏𝑑 ∥) 
2 √𝑏𝑑 ∥. (4) 
Dividing  𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ( Eq. 3 ) by 𝑆 𝑏 ( Eq. 4 ), the diﬀusion  signal has an analytic  
form given by: 
𝑆 𝑏,𝑔 ≈𝑆 𝑏 2 √𝑏𝑑 ∥√
𝜋erf ( √𝑏𝑑 ∥) 1 𝐹 1 (1∕2; 3∕2; 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤− 𝑏𝑑 ∥𝒈𝒈 ⊤) 
1 𝐹 1 (1∕2; 3∕2; 𝜅𝝁𝝁⊤) . (5) 
Here the model depends  on only two free parameters,  𝑑 ∥and 𝑂𝐷𝐼(or 
𝜅). During ﬁtting, 𝑆 𝑏 was calculated  for each shell in turn. 
In our initial investigations  we aimed to simultaneously  estimate  the 
three parameters  𝑑 ∥, 𝜅and 𝐹 𝑖𝑛 = 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 𝑆 0 on a voxelwise  basis according  to 
Eq. 3 . However,  upon closer examination,  the parameters  were found to 
be degenerate,  leading  to an overestimation  of 𝑑 ∥. Here we used simu- 
lated data (shown  later) to investigate  the model parameter  degeneracy  
and bias in relation  to the noise characteristics  of the data. Crucially,  
we found that the parameter  degeneracies  and bias could be overcome  
if we ﬁtted to high SNR data, and explicitly  model both a signal oﬀset 
and the Rician noise ﬂoor. The presence  of a signal oﬀset in the in vivo 
data was supported  by the presence  of non-zero  signal in the ventricles  
at high b-value.  Consequently,  we accounted  for a signal oﬀset i.e. some 
background  signal that was independent  of diﬀusion  weighting,  where 
𝑌 = 𝑆 + 𝑐, (6) 
𝑌 being the data, 𝑆the diﬀusion  signal and 𝑐the oﬀset, which is some- 
times referred  to as a dot compartment.  Then in magnitude  data, we 
also accounted  for the rectiﬁed  Rician noise ﬂoor using Koay’s inver- 
sion technique  Koay and Basser (2006) : 
𝑌 = √
( 𝑆 + 𝑐) 2 + 𝜖2 . (7) 
𝜖being the Rician scaling parameter,  which is equivalent  to the standard  
deviation  of Gaussian  noise for complex  data. Typically,  𝜖is estimated  
a priori from noise estimation  methods  ( Veraart  et al., 2016 ). However,  
as shown below, a priori estimation  might not be ideal as even a small 
misestimation  of 𝜖could lead to large parameter  biases. An alternative  
way of circumventing  Rician noise ﬂoor eﬀects is to consider  real-valued  
data with Gaussian  noise characteristics  ( Fan et al., 2020 ). Using com- 
plex data, the signal phase is ﬁrst removed  from each voxel after which 
the real component  of the signal is extracted  ( Fan et al., 2020 ). In this 
study, the model was ﬁtted to both real valued data (where 𝑐was esti- 
mated) and magnitude  data (where both 𝑐and 𝜖were estimated)  from 
the same subjects.  As even a small misestimation  of 𝑐or 𝜖can lead to a 
large parameter  bias, both were estimated  as parameters  of the model 
that were ﬁtted voxelwise  during model optimisation.  
2.2.1. The ﬁnal model & optimisation  
Combining  Eq. 5 with either Eq. 6 (real-valued  data) or 7 (magnitude  
data) and assuming  a known ﬁbre orientation  𝜇= 𝑉 1 (the primary  eigen- 
vector of the diﬀusion  tensor ( Basser et al., 1994 )), the ﬁnal model was 
dependent  on only three or four parameters:  the orientation  dispersion  
index 𝑂𝐷𝐼, the axial diﬀusivity  𝑑 ∥, the signal oﬀset 𝑐, and, in magni- 
tude data only, the noise ﬂoor parameter  𝜖. Fig. 1 shows a graphical  
depiction  of the model. 
During optimisation,  the parameters  were bounded  such that 𝑂𝐷𝐼 ∈
[0 , 1] and 𝑑 ∥∈[ 0 , 4] μm 2 /ms where the diﬀusivity  in free water at 37 ◦𝐶
is ∼3 − 3 . 1 μm 2 /ms . Due to the observed  possible  degeneracy  between  the two noise parameters  𝑐and 𝜖, when both were estimated  in mag- 
nitude data, they were constrained  to be 50 − 150% of 𝑐and 𝜖as es- 
timated  from high b-value  data in the ventricles  (a Rician distribution  
was ﬁtted to 𝑏 = 17 . 8 ms/ μm 2 data, where 𝑐 = the non-centrality  param- 
eter and 𝜖= the scale parameter).  When only one noise parameter  was 
estimated  (in real-valued  data or simulations  with 𝑐 = 0 ), the noise pa- 
rameter  was constrained  such that 𝑐 ∈[ 0 , 0 . 5 ⋅𝑆 0 ] or 𝜖∈[ 0 , 0 . 5 ⋅𝑆 0 ] . The 
powder  averaged  signal 𝑆 𝑏 was calculated  for each shell in turn, where 
the data 𝑌 were for ﬁrst corrected  for any signal oﬀset 𝑐or noise ﬂoor 
𝜖according  to Eq. 6 or 7 (i.e. 𝑌 was converted  to 𝑆prior to signal av- 
eraging).  The model was optimised  using the Metropolis  Hastings  (MH) 
algorithm  which aﬀorded  estimation  of each parameter’s  posterior  dis- 
tribution.  The initial parameters  for MH were found by grid search. 
Our investigations  using simulated  data demonstrated  how higher 
SNR leads to more precise estimates  of 𝑂𝐷𝐼and 𝑑 ∥. Consequently,  for 
in vivo data, the model was ﬁtted to the concatenated  signal across 
many ( 𝑁) voxels to boost SNR. Here, the signal from each voxel was 
ﬁrst rotated  such that the primary  eigenvector  of the diﬀusion  tensor 
was aligned  and the secondary  eigenvector  was randomly  orientated,  
since the Watson  distribution  describes  symmetric  dispersion  about the 
primary  ﬁbre orientation.  As NODDI  assumes  a single-ﬁbre  population  
per voxel, we ﬁtted to high FA voxels from the corpus callosum  which, 
to enforce  some data consistency,  were selected  to have similar 𝑆 0 
( ̄𝑆 0 ± 10% ). Instead  of concatenating  the signal, we could have aver- 
aged the signal across voxels (as we did using simulated  data below).  
However,  this would require  1) the diﬀusion  signal from each voxel to 
ﬁrst be rotated  so that the primary  ﬁbre orientations  align, and 2) the 
rotated  signal to be resampled  along consistent  gradient  orientations  
𝑔. Consequently,  signal concatenation  was deemed  preferable  to signal 
averaging  across voxels, as our results would not be biased by interpola-  
tion eﬀects which can introduce  smoothing  and eﬀect noise properties  
in non-trivial  ways.

verbally-guided  narrative  suggestions.  A conventional  supervised  learn- 
ing approach  assuming  that emotion-related  brain activity  was station-  
ary within each 3–5 min emotion  imagination  period, applied  to the 
resulting  EEG datasets,  struggled  to achieve  high emotion  classiﬁca-  
tion accuracy  with large diﬀerences  in classiﬁcation  performance  across 
emotion  categories  ( Kothe et al., 2013 ). 
Furthermore,  most EEG-based  emotion  studies often assumed  that 
subjective  ratings of emotional  experiences  (e.g., valence  and arousal  
used in popular  DEAP dataset Koelstra  et al., 2011 ) or group-validated  
labels of emotional  stimuli (e.g., averaged  across a pool of subjective  
ratings Lin et al., 2010 ) represent  the actual emotional  state changes  
in the participants.  Few studies have aimed to validate  or challenge  
these assumptions  by exploring  the relationship  between  the underly-  
ing EEG dynamics  and the emotion  labels, providing  evidence  for an- 
swers to some key questions  in the ﬁeld: (a) Is the subjective  report 
of emotional  experiences  consistent  with objective  measures  from neu- 
rophysiological  recordings?,  (b) Should diﬀerences  between  emotions  
be better described  using aﬀective  dimensions  or emotional  categories  
( Barrett,  1998; Cowen and Keltner,  2017; Mauss and Robinson,  2009 )?, 
(c) What are the most prominent  spatiotemporal  EEG dynamic  changes  
during emotional  experience?,  and (d) Are activities  in speciﬁc  brain 
regions  associated  with speciﬁc  emotions  ( Lindquist  et al., 2012 )? 
These questions  motivate  the application  of unsupervised  learning  
approaches  to characterize  emotional  state changes  by clustering  emo- 
tional states in terms of EEG activity  diﬀerences  rather than using 
subjective  labels. To our knowledge,  only a few studies have used an 
unsupervised-learning  approach  in EEG-based  emotion  studies.  For ex- 
ample, a Gaussian  mixture  model (GMM)  was used for learning  segment-  
level variability  in non-stationary  EEG ( Zhuang  et al., 2014 ), a hyper- 
graph representation  was introduced  to capture  hidden structures  in 
EEG signals across emotion  trials ( Liang et al., 2019 ), and a deep belief 
network  (DBN) and hidden Markov  model (HMM)  were employed  for 
unsupervised  feature learning  and tracking  of emotional  stage switching  
( Zheng et al., 2014 ). However,  these studies did not explore  the relation-  
ship between  the spatiotemporal  structure  of the EEG and the associated  
emotion  state labels. 
Alternatively,  adaptive  mixture  independent  component  analysis  
(adaptive  mixture  ICA, AMICA)  ( Hsu et al., 2018a; Palmer et al., 2008 ) 
assumes  multidimensional  data can be modeled  by an independent  com- 
ponent analysis  mixture  model (ICAMM)  ( Lee et al., 2000 ) in which 
each model represents  a decomposition  of the data into (possibly  con- 
tiguous)  segments  associated  with a distinct  set of statistically  indepen-  
dent component  processes.  Previous  studies have shown that ICAMM,  or 
its more advanced  instantiation  in the AMICA  algorithm  ( Palmer et al., 
2008 ), can separate  EEG activities  during diﬀerent  sleep stages ( Hsu 
et al., 2018a; Salazar  et al., 2010 ), ﬂuctuations  of drowsiness  ( Hsu et al., 
2018a; Jung et al., 2000 ), mental state changes  during memory  test 
( Safont et al., 2017 ), guided meditation  ( Hsu et al., 2018b ), and emo- 
tional video watching  ( Ran et al., 2020 ). 
This study aims to employ  multi-model  AMICA  as an unsupervised-  
learning  approach  for exploring  the brain-state  dynamics  during dif- 
ferent emotional  experiences.  We applied  AMICA  to a dataset from 
Onton and Makeig  (2009) , containing  high-density  (250-channel  EEG 
data) collected  from 31 participants  during a self-paced  emotion  imag- 
ination experiment  in which the participants  induced  a series of 15 
emotional  experiences  by following  recorded  voice narratives  with eyes 
closed, using their own imagination.  Marrying  a promising  unsupervised  
method  for modeling  EEG nonstationarity  with a unique high-density  
EEG dataset containing  ﬁfteen 3–5 min periods  of emotional  experi- 
ence targeting  ﬁfteen diﬀerent  emotions  enabled  us to investigate,  (1) 
whether  such data-driven  segmentation  might self-organize  and then be 
clustered  according  to aﬀective  dimension  (e.g., valence),  or separate  
into distinct  models for each emotion,  and (2) how does EEG spatiotem-  
poral dynamics  vary across self-paced  experiences  of imagined  emo- 
tion and across participants.  We study the putative  cortical  brain-based  
sources  active during emotion  imagination  periods  and diﬀerences  in AMICA  models across emotions  and participants.  These results provide  
evidence  that emotional  processes  vary across emotions,  but not neces- 
sarily consistent  across participants.  Finally,  we discuss the studys limi- 
tations and make suggestions  for the future research,  such as comparing  
the results with those obtained  from supervised  methods  to validate  the 
consistency  of ﬁndings  and investigate  emotion-speciﬁc  activities.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Dataset and preprocessing  
2.1.1. Dataset 
The dataset used in the study contains  31 recordings  collected  as de- 
scribed  in Onton and Makeig  (2009) . The data are available  at HeadIT  
website  ( http://headit.ucsd.edu  , Imagined  Emotion  with Continuous  Data 
under Studies ). EEG data were collected  from 250 scalp channels  using 
a Biosemi  ActiveTwo  system (Amsterdam,  Netherlands)  at a sampling  
rate of 256 Hz per channel  with 24-bit resolution.  Caps with a custom  
whole-head  montage  were used to position  the electrodes  on most of 
the scalp, forehead,  and lateral face surface,  omitting  chin and ﬂeshy 
cheek areas. Relative  3D locations  of the electrodes  for each partici-  
pant were recorded  (Polhemus,  Inc.). For more details,  see Onton and 
Makeig  (2009) and the description  on the HeadIT  website.  
2.1.2. Experiment  and participants  
Thirty-one  volunteer  participants  participated  in the emotion  imag- 
ination experiment  (19 females;  age 25 . 5 ± 5 years) and gave informed  
consent  in accordance  with UCSD institutional  review board require-  
ments. All participants  reported  being able to induce realistic  emotional  
experiences  for most of the suggested  emotions  by following  a recorded  
verbal narrative  and using their own imagination.  For example,  for 
“anger the narrative  suggested  that the participant  either recall a sit- 
uation in which they had been angry, or else imagine  a scene in which 
they would become  angry, giving two examples  ( “You ﬁnd someone  
smashing  your car for no reason with a baseball  bat.). Throughout  the 
experiment,  participants  were seated comfortably  with eyes closed in 
a quiet, dimly-lit  room, and listened  to the narratives  through  ear-bud  
earphones.  
Fig. 1 a shows the paradigm  of the self-paced  emotion  imagination  
experiment.  Each session began with 2 min of silent eyes-closed  rest, fol- 
lowed by pre-recorded  general  instructions  and then a 5 min guided re- 
laxation  induction  to promote  a relaxed,  inwardly-focused  state of mind. 
In 15 following  task periods,  the participant  was presented  with a se- 
quence of recorded  voice-guided  inductions  instructing  them to recall 
or imagine  scenarios  for stimulating  a vivid, embodied  experience  of 
the suggested  emotion.  Participants  were encouraged  to pay attention  
to their somatic  state, as such attention  tended to increase  the vividness  
and duration  of their emotional  experience  ( Damasio,  1999 ). Partici-  
pants were told to take as much time as they needed  to recall or imag- 
ine a scenario  that would induce a realistic  experience  of the suggested  
emotion.  No external  time limits or indicators  were provided.  Partici-  
pants pressed  a right-hand  held thumb button once to signal they had 
begun to have a somatic  experience  of (i.e., to “feel) the targeted  emo- 
tion, then a left-hand  held button when the imagined  scene and feeling 
began to wane, triggering  (40 s) instructions  to again relax (through  a 
following  silent 10 s period),  letting go of the previously  experienced  
scene and feeling.  Then a 10 s audio clip prepared  them for the next 
emotion  imagination  period. 
The 15 emotional  imagination  periods  were presented  in a pseudo-  
random  sequence  that alternated  between  one of eight positive-valence  
emotions  (love, joy, happiness,  relief, compassion,  contentedness,  ex- 
citement,  awe) followed  one of seven negative-valence  emotions  (anger, 
jealousy,  disgust,  frustration,  fear, sadness,  grief). The experimental  ses- 
sion was about 80 min in length. Button-press  delimited  durations  of the 
active emotion  imagination  periods  varied between  43 s and 12 min;

qualitatively,  activation  patterns  seem similar.  Therefore,  our general  
aims were, ﬁrst, to attempt  the empirical  integration  of data across the 
paradigms  of aversive  and appetitive  conditioning.  Second,  we wanted  
to demonstrate  the feasibility  of integrating  ﬁndings  from these two 
paradigms  in order to enable further research  across a multitude  of other 
paradigms  of varying  similarity.  
The diﬀerential  aversive  or appetitive  conditioning  paradigms  that 
are employed  in fMRI research  in humans  are highly alike. An initially  
neutral  stimulus  becomes  a conditioned  stimulus  (CS + ) after repeated  
pairing  with an aversive  or appetitive  unconditioned  stimulus  (UCS, e.g. 
electric  shock or money).  A second stimulus  (CS-) is never paired with a 
UCS ( Mackintosh,  1975 ). On the one hand these are striking  similarities,  
on the other hand reward and fear seem diametrically  opposed  lead- 
ing to separate  investigations  into brain regions  constituting  a fear net- 
work or a reward network.  The neural correlates  of aversive  condition-  
ing have been researched  extensively  in human neuroimaging,  which 
has led to a large body of fMRI results on the topic as well as meta- 
analyses  (for reviews  see Etkin and Wager 2007 , Fullana  et al. 2016 , 
Mechias  et al. 2010 , Sehlmeyer  et al. 2009 ). In parallel,  fMRI studies 
on appetitive  conditioning  have begun to accumulate  (for reviews  see 
Averbeck  and Costa 2017 , Chase et al. 2015 , Martin-Soelch  et al. 2007 ). 
It has become  increasingly  apparent  that the ﬁndings  from aversive  and 
appetitive  conditioning  are qualitatively  similar.  The same regions  of- 
ten emerge  from separate  meta-analyses  of responses  to a CS + com- 
pared to a CS- in aversive  ( Etkin and Wager, 2007 ; Fullana  et al., 2016 ; 
Mechias  et al., 2010 ) and appetitive  ( Chase et al., 2015 ) conditioning,  
see Table 1 for details.  Seminal  theoretical  models of aversive  con- 
ditioning  focus mainly on the amygdala  ( Herry and Johansen,  2014 ; 
Tovote et al., 2015 ) while appetitive  conditioning  models also include  
striatal regions  such as the Nucleus  Accumbens  (NAcc; Averbeck  and 
Costa 2017 , Martin-Soelch  et al. 2007 ). In summary,  the amygdala,  
NAcc, caudate  nucleus,  putamen,  insula and thalamus  seem to be in- 
volved in both aversive  and appetitive  learning,  based on qualitative  
comparison  of empirical  data as well as theoretical  models (see Table 1 ). 
The cerebellum  has been reported  in the most recent meta-analysis  of 
aversive  learning  ( Fullana  et al., 2016 ) and since then in another  aver- 
sive conditioning  study in humans  ( Ernst et al., 2019 ). This region may 
be crucial for many diﬀerent  types of outcome  prediction  ( Popa and 
Ebner, 2018 ) and has been shown associated  with appetitive  predic- 
tion in animal data ( Heﬄey  and Hull, 2019 ), so cerebellar  activity  
might be another  possible  commonality  between  human aversive  and 
appetitive  learning.  Based on these apparently  overlapping  regions,  it 
is assumed  that the concepts  ‘fear network’  and ‘reward  network’  share mesolimbic  dopamine  pathways  and thus may share a common  basis 
in an anticipatory  motivational  system related to learning  in general  
( Menon and Uddin, 2010 ; Moscarello  and LeDoux,  2013 ; Seeley et al., 
2007 ; Stefanova  et al., 2020 ). However,  these assumptions  are mostly 
based on qualitative  literature  reviews.  Only few neuroimaging  studies 
have systematically  compared  aversive  and appetitive  learning  in the 
same experiment  and even then mostly focused  on diﬀerences  instead  of 
similarities  (e.g. Breiter et al. 2001 , Carter et al. 2009 , Lake et al. 2019 , 
Sankar et al. 2019 ). While elucidating  the diﬀerences  between  these 
mechanisms  remains  important,  quantifying  cross-paradigm  similarities  
might provide  an even greater opportunity.  
In this paper, we adopt a multivariate  analysis  approach  to quanti-  
tatively  integrate  previously  published  evidence  across paradigms  and 
samples  in order to better understand  the commonalities  of aversive  
and appetitive  processes.  With the help of machine  learning  classiﬁ-  
cation algorithms,  we can test whether  whole-brain  patterns  of acti- 
vation are present  in a dataset and whether  they distinguish  between  
conditions  ( Weaverdyck  et al., 2020 ; Woo et al., 2017 ). Multivariate  
approaches  have already  been used to great success  in ﬁnding  and val- 
idating whole brain response  patterns  associated  with cognitive  and af- 
fective states, e.g. the experience  of pain ( Wager et al., 2013 ), emotions  
( Kragel and LaBar, 2014 ; Saarimäki  et al., 2016 ) or perceiving  sexual 
pictures  ( van ’t Hof et al., 2021 ; for a review on neural signatures  see 
Kragel et al. (2018) based on data from the same kind of paradigm.  
Here, instead  of developing  an activation  model from similar paradigms,  
we apply an already  existing  meta-analytic  response  pattern  from one 
paradigm  (aversive  conditioning)  to data from a similar paradigm  (ap- 
petitive  conditioning)  to empirically  identify  activation  commonalities.  
Using a meta-analytical  pattern  instead  of training  a new aversive  con- 
ditioning  pattern  enables  us to investigate  similarity  of our current  ap- 
petitive  conditioning  data with the summarized  data of numerous  past 
aversive  conditioning  studies,  gathered  over many years of research.  
In this study, we aim to identify  commonalities  of a diﬀerential  ac- 
tivation  pattern  related to aversive  conditioning,  based on the meta- 
analysis  by Fullana  et al. (2016) , with activation  patterns  in appetitive  
conditioning  paradigms.  In order to assess generalizability  of the sim- 
ilarities,  we carry out the same tests in three independent  appetitive  
conditioning  datasets  with varying  features  regarding  sample charac-  
teristics  and procedural  details ( Kruse et al., 2018 , 2020 ; Tapia León 
et al., 2019 ). First, we expect that the brain activation  diﬀerence  be- 
tween aversive  CS + (avCS + ) and aversive  CS- (avCS-)  will be similar to 
the activation  diﬀerence  between  appetitive  CS + (appCS  + ) and appet- 
itive CS- (appCS-),  measured  by a pattern  expression  score. We expect 
2  S. Klein, O. Kruse, I. Tapia León et al. NeuroImage  263 (2022) 119594 
this for diﬀerential  activation  over the whole brain as well as for a priori 
anatomical  regions  of interest  (ROIs: NAcc, caudate  nucleus,  putamen,  
amygdala,  thalamus,  insula, cerebellum),  which have been implicated  
in both forms of learning  empirically  and theoretically  but may have 
traditionally  been associated  with one paradigm  more than the other. 
Second,  we hypothesize  that the separate  appCS + and appCS- activation  
data will diﬀer in their similarity  to the avCS + > avCS- pattern.  We ex- 
pect to accurately  discriminate  whether  a pattern  expression  score stems 
from whole brain appCS + or appCS- data based on the score’s size via 
forced-choice  classiﬁcation.  With these analyses,  we aim to provide  em- 
pirical evidence  for the neural commonalities  of aversive  and appetitive  
conditioning  at whole brain and region level. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Sample descriptions  
We used three previously  published  datasets  on appetitive  condi- 
tioning.  All studies were approved  by the local ethics committee  and 
were conducted  in accordance  with the 1964 declaration  of Helsinki  
and its later amendments.  Participants  gave written  informed  consent  
and received  10 €per hour or course credit for their participation  plus 
monetary  gains from the tasks. 
2.1.1. Active learning/homogeneous  sample 
The Active Learning/Homogeneous  Sample  included  only male sub- 
jects and a between-person  acute stress condition  ( Kruse et al., 2018 , see 
also Kruse et al. (2017) . For our analysis,  we included  only the no-stress

accumulator.  According  to the model, the duration  of an event is evalu- 
ated by the accumulator  based on the number  of mental ticks it receives.  
The accumulator  works closely with memory  to make decisions  that af- 
fect behaviour.  These components  are inﬂuenced  by attention,  and thus 
the factors aﬀecting  attention  will logically  inﬂuence  time perception.  
Lake, Labar, and Meck (2016) reasoned  that the role of attention  in time 
perception  should not be treated as a uniﬁed resource.  It has been ar- 
gued that arousal  increases  the speed of the pulse-generating  pacemaker  
( Droit-Volet  & Meck, 2007 ; Li & Yuen, 2015 ). In this condition,  more 
pulses pass through  the gate and reach the accumulator,  resulting  in a 
subjective  feeling of a longer duration  –an overestimation.  In contrast,  
diverted  attention  closes the gate. In other words, time is no longer ade- 
quately  tracked,  and the system ‘loses count.’ The consequence  is fewer 
counts arriving  at the accumulator  and a sense of ‘time ﬂying’ during 
absorbing  tasks –an underestimation  of duration.  
The Attentional  Gate Model has been relatively  successful  in predict-  
ing factors that aﬀect time perception  ( Coull, Cheng & Meck, 2011 ). It 
has been instrumental  in generating  research  hypotheses  and illustrat-  
ing the eﬀects of diﬀerent  factors on time perception.  However,  it has 
attracted  criticism  because  the anatomical  correlates  of these processes  
are largely unknown  (see Bhattacharjee,  2006 ). For instance,  some re- 
searchers  have doubted  that there is an anatomical  locus for a pace- 
maker in the brain; they counter-proposed  that the ‘counting’  is achieved  
by the synchronisation  of neuronal  ﬁring ( Bhattacharjee,  2006 ; Coull et 
al., 2011 ). 
A review of the literature  suggests  that a network  of common  brain 
regions  is involved  in diﬀerent  time perception-related  tasks. These 
brain regions  include  the supplementary  motor area (SMA), basal gan- 
glia (BG), cerebellum,  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC),  poste- 
rior parietal  cortex (PPC) and insula (e.g., Gooch, Wiener,  Hamilton  
& Coslett,  2011 ; Teki, Grube, Kumar & Griﬃths,  2011 ). These regions  
have been reported  in published  reviews  and meta-analyses  covering  the 
neuroimaging  studies of time perception  ( Lewis & Miall, 2006 , Wiener,  
Turkeltaub  & Coslett,  2010b ). Additional  studies of brain stimulation  
techniques  further support  the role of these brain areas in time percep-  
tion. For instance,  Alexander  et al. (2005) showed  that the application  
of rTMS to the PPC led to an attenuated  performance  in temporal  judg- 
ment. Wiener  and colleagues  ( Wiener,  Hamilton,  Turkeltaub,  Matell & 
Coslett,  2010a ) also showed  that rTMS applied  to the supramarginal  
gyrus, part of the PPC, led to an overestimation  of time duration.  There 
is also evidence  supporting  the role of the cerebellum  in precise tim- 
ing ( Ivry & Keele, 1989 ; Ivry & Spencer,  2004 ). Vicario,  Martino,  and 
Koch (2013) examined  the eﬀect of tDCS on time perception  based on 
a spatial attention  paradigm.  They tested anodal and cathodal  stimula-  
tion, as well as sham stimulation,  on the left and right PPC. The cathodal  
stimulation  of the right PPC resulted  in the overestimation  of time dura- 
tion, whereas  cathodal  stimulation  of the left PPC reduced  the variabil-  
ity of the reported  durations.  Javadi,  Brunec,  Walsh, Penny, and Spiers 
(2014) found that stimulating  the PPC lead to improved  performance  
in duration  judgment.  Recently,  Mioni, Stablum,  Prunetti,  and Grondin  
(2016) reported  that stimulating  respective  sensory  regions  aﬀected  the 
perceived  duration  in corresponding  modalities.  For instance,  stimulat-  
ing V1 with tDCS resulted  in an underestimation  of visually  perceived  
duration  and an increase  in variability.  
With respect to our hypothesised  regions  of interest,  tDCS has been 
shown to produce  signiﬁcant  behavioural  alternations  in the DLPFC 
and cerebellum.  Studies  examining  DLPFC stimulation  have predom-  
inantly reported  altered working  memory  performance  ( Mulquiney,  
Hoy, Daskalakis  & Fitzgerald,  2011 ), alertness  ( Nelson,  McKinley,  
Golob Warm & Parasuraman,  2014 ) and various  cognitive  tasks (see 
Dedoncker,  Brunoni,  Baeken,  & Vanderhasselt,  2016 for a review);  there 
have also been reports of eﬀects on cognitive  control ( Metuki,  Sela & 
Lavidor,  2012 ) and motivational  states ( Fregni et al., 2008 ). 
Studies  of the eﬀect of tDCS on the cerebellum  have predominantly  
reported  changes  in motor function  and motor learning,  but there is 
emerging  evidence  for its inﬂuence  on language  and higher cognitive  functions  ( Grimaldi  et al., 2014 ; D’Mello  et al., 2017 ). In the neuroimag-  
ing literature,  the role of cerebellum  in higher cognitive  and aﬀective  
processes  has received  accumulating  data support  (Buckner,  2013). In 
particular,  Marek et al. (2018) showed  that cerebellar  BOLD resting 
state data disproportionally  expanded  functional  coupling  with the fron- 
toparietal  circuit as compared  to other brain circuits.  This ﬁndings  pro- 
vides a potential  route on how cerebellar  stimulation  can inﬂuence  cog- 
nition, especially  in terms of time perception.  
These studies have indicated  that subjective  time perception  involves  
multiple  cortical  regions  and their connections;  the Attentional  Gate 
Model highlights  the role of attention  and arousal  on subjective  time per- 
ception.  Studies  aligning  these two streams  of research  have found that 
the DLPFC is an area that is responsive  to subjective  timing tasks (e.g., 
Gooch et al., 2011 ; Teki et al., 2011 ) and is also known to be related to 
the working  memory  and attention  circuits  ( Corbetta  & Shulman,  2011 ). 
Thus, perturbing  this area should aﬀect the performance  of both timing 
and attention  tasks. The results of such perturbations  allow us to test the 
Attentional  Gate Model. Speciﬁcally,  we can test whether  increasing  at- 
tention  resources  required  for a task would result in an overestimation  of 
duration.  Also, the inﬂuences  of perturbations  to behavioural  attention  
tasks can be measured  according  to on the prediction  of the Attentional  
Gate Model. It is noteworthy  that the studies reviewed  above provide  
no direct evidence  for the mechanisms  of time distortion  described  by 
the Attentional  Gate Model. For example,  Gooch et al.’s study identiﬁed  
the brain areas for time perception  by comparing  stroke patients’  lesion 
sites and deﬁcits  in time perception.  Likewise,  Teki et al. examined  the 
activations  of brain areas during time perception  tasks and made no 
attempt  to measure  the components  of the Attentional  Gate Model or 
apply neuromodulations  to the brain areas responsible  for time percep-  
tion. Moreover,  previous  fMRI or neuromodulation  studies rarely took 
into consideration  individual  variations  in subjective  time perception  
and the ability to perceive  durations  accurately.  
Thus, previous  studies have shown that tDCS with an appropriate  
stimulation  protocol  can be a useful tool for altering  attention  and work- 
ing memory.  The exact mechanisms  on how tDCS inﬂuences  cognition  is 
still under active research,  and accumulated  data had pointed  to a cas- 
cade of neurophysiological  events including  i) enhanced  regional  cere- 
bral blood ﬂow post anodal stimulation  and reduced  regional  cerebral  
blood ﬂow post cathodal  stimulation  ( Zheng, Alsop & Schlaug,  2011 ); ii) 
changes  in functional  and eﬀective  connectivity  ( Chib, Yun, Takahashi  
& Shimojo,  2013 ; Keeser et al., 2011 ; Peña-Gómez  et al., 2012 ); and iii) 
anodal stimulation  induced  beta and theta band oscillations  in EEG sig- 
nals ( Balconi  & Vitaloni,  2012 ; Maeoka,  Matsuo,  Hiyamizu,  Morioka  & 
Ando, 2012 ). For a detailed  review,  please see Wörsching  et al. (2016) . 
The primary  objective  of the present  study is to identify  the neural 
correlates  of time perception  as depicted  by the Attentional  Gate Model. 
Converging  evidence  from diﬀerent  studies suggests  that stimulating  the 
speciﬁed  brain regions  with tDCS inﬂuences  attention  and time percep-  
tion. Thus, we hypothesise  that applying  non-invasive  stimulation  to 
areas with a potential  role in the Attentional  Gate Model may aﬀect the 
perception  of time through  an altered attention  state and applying  non- 
invasive  stimulation  to the components  of the Attentional  Gate Model 
may also aﬀect attention  performance.  To provide  additional  support  to 
the hypotheses  about our timing tasks, fMRI scanning  was conducted  
to identify  the precise brain areas associated  with our time perception  
tasks that considered  individual  variations  in subjective  time percep-  
tion, optimized  the spatial resolution  and the strength  of tDCS applied,  
and conﬁrmed  that the proposed  areas have in fact been stimulated.  This 
study systematically  examined  the eﬀect of tDCS stimulation  on two cor- 
tical regions,  the right DLPFC (right DLPFC)  and cerebellum,  and their 
inﬂuence  on time perception  and distortion.  The results should provide  
supporting  evidence  for the validity  of the Attentional  Gate Model, and 
thereby  helped in the mapping  of the neural circuits  responsible  for sub- 
jective time perception.  
According  to the Attentional  Gate Model, we can use tDCS to ma- 
nipulate  the subjective  experience  of time. To test this, two sites, the 
2  W.O. Li, C.K.-C. Yu and K.S.L. Yuen NeuroImage  260 (2022) 119368 
right DLPFC and the cerebellum,  were stimulated  separately  in three 
conditions.  The right DLPFC was tested speciﬁcally,  given the abundant  
literature  showing  the correlation  between  its activities  and attention  
and memory  tasks ( Coﬀman  et al., 2012 ; Corbetta  & Shulman,  2011 ). 
The cerebellum  was also tested, given its reported  inﬂuence  on tim- 
ing tasks ( Koch, Oliveri,  Torriero,  Salerno,  Gerfo & Caltagirone,  2007 ; 
Lewis & Miall, 2006 ) and its potential  role as the internal  timer in the 
human brain ( Ivry & Keele, 1989 ; Ivry & Spencer,  2004 ). Applying  tDCS 
of opposite  polarities  to these areas would diﬀerentially  inﬂuence  sub- 
jective time perception.  According  to the Attentional  Gate Model, the 
inﬂuence  of the tDCS on time perception  was compared  with its eﬀect 
on attention.  That is, an increase  in attention  should correlate  with an 
overestimation  of time due to the widened  gate of the counter.  Alter- 
natively,  if changes  to attention  do not alter time perception,  these two 
behavioural  measurements  would not show parallel  changes.  Attention  
Network  Test (ANT) was administered  to provide  a measurement  for the 
components  of the Attentional  Gate Model. 
2. Hypotheses  
2.1. Study 1. Using fMRI to conﬁrm  neural correlates  for a 1000 ms time 
discrimination  task 
Subjective  time perception  involves  multiple  brain regions.  The 
DLPFC and cerebellum  appear to be the essential  cortical  areas for sub- 
jective time perception  ( Gooch et al., 2011 ; Teki et al., 2011 ). The 
present  studies used a time-discrimination  task to measure  both the dis- 
tortion of perceived  time and its variability.  Wiener,  Turkeltaub,  and 
Coslett (2010b)  emphasised  that neural correlates  of time perception  
depend  on the task nature in their meta-analysis  of neuroimaging  stud- 
ies about time perception.  This scanning  test was used in the selection  
of the most suitable  tDCS stimulation  sites for the designated  time dis- 
crimination  task at 1000 ms in the following  series of studies.  
2.2. Study 2. Applying  tDCS to the right DLPFC to manipulate  subjective  
time perception  
After conﬁrming  the hypothesis  of right DLPFC and cerebellum  play- 
ing an essential  role in the 1000 ms time discrimination  task, Studies  2 
and 3 testiﬁed  hypotheses  derived  from Attentional  Gate Model. Previ- 
ous studies have suggested  that the DLPFC has a distinctive  inﬂuence  
on time perception.  Importantly,  Attentional  Gate Model emphasises  
the role of the DLPFC in time perception.  The right DLPFC has been 
found to be a signiﬁcant  area for the attention  mechanism.  Studies  have 
found that repetitive  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (rTMS) to the 
right DLPFC produces  an overestimation  of time reproduction  tasks with 
supra-second  duration  ( > 1,600 ms) ( Koch et al., 2007 ). Applying  tDCS 
to the right DLPFC has also been found to aﬀect the performance  of 
attention-related  tasks ( Coﬀman  et al., 2012 ). Accordingly,  it was hy- 
pothesised  that applying  tDCS to the right DLPFC would aﬀect time per- 
ception.  Anodal  tDCS was expected  to enhance  excitatory  activities  in 
this area and therefore  result in time overestimation.  In contrast,  catho- 
dal tDCS, was expected  to suppress  right DLPFC activities,  and result in 
time underestimation.  In addition,  anodal stimulation  has been found 
to improve  accuracy  in duration  judgment  tasks ( Javadi et al., 2014 ). 
Therefore,  the anodal tDCS application  should also result in a decrease  
in the variability  (i.e., the standard  deviation  of the Gaussian  curves)  of 
perceived  subjective  equivalent  (PSE) in time discrimination  tasks. 
Coﬀman  et al. (2012) reported  that anodal tDCS applied  to the right 
DLPFC signiﬁcantly  improves  performance  in alerting  tasks. We hypoth-  
esised replication  of this eﬀect. In addition,  ANT data would provide  be- 
havioural  evidence  for the argument  that changes  in perceived  duration  
correlate  with changes  in the performance  of attention-related  tasks, 
as predicted  by the Attentional  Gate Model. Besides,  an N-back task 
would illustrate  how tDCS may inﬂuence  working  memory.  Attention  Gate Model infers that, after counting  the mental ticks, the accumulator  
would compare  the count with the reference  in the working  memory.  
In contrast  to the very limited literature  on tDCS and time percep-  
tion, meta-analytic  studies ( Hill, Fitzgerald  & Hoy, 2016 ; Mancuso  et al., 
2016 ) consistently  showed  that anodal stimulation  on the left DLPFC 
enhanced  working  memory.  However,  stimulation  to the right DLPFC 
usually  leads to inconsistent  results ( Brunoni  & Vanderhasselt,  2014 ; 
Hill et al., 2016 ). In addition,  there are studies suggesting  that the lat- 
erality of anodal stimulation  does not matter ( Dedoncker  et al., 2016 ; 
Tremblay  et al., 2014 ), or prefrontal  tDCS stimulations  do not make 
any impact on working  memory/executive  functions  at all (Horvath  et 
al., 2015). Therefore,  it is premature  to conclude  the precise eﬀect of 
left-anodal/right-cathodal  DLPFC montage  on working  memory.  An al- 
ternative  hypothesis  therefore  is that both left anodal and right anodal 
DLPFC stimulations  would enhance  attention  and lead to an overesti-  
mation of perceived  duration,  whereas  sham stimulation  would not.

ronal coupling  between  populations.  To this end, we developed  a novel 
multistage  analysis  approach  that combines  dimensionality  reduction,  
bootstrap  aggregating  and multivariate  classiﬁcation.  
To test our approach,  we employed  it to explore  changes  of brain- 
wide electrophysiological  coupling  in Multiple  Sclerosis.  Multiple  Scle- 
rosis (MS) is an inﬂammatory,  demyelinating  secondary  neurodegen-  
erative disease  ( Dendrou  et al., 2015 ). From early disease  stages on 
and during disease  progression  ( Amato et al., 2010 ), accumulating  
white-matter  lesions and cortical  atrophy  can lead to cognitive  de- 
cline and physical  disability  ( Chiaravalloti  and DeLuca,  2008 ). The 
high temporal  resolution  of MEG and EEG allows to characterize  
the frequency-speciﬁc  coupling  of neuronal  activity,  which may re- 
ﬂect ( Hipp and Siegel, 2015 ; Siegel et al., 2012 ) and even mediate  
( Fries, 2005 ) interactions  in large-scale  brain networks.  Accordingly,  
electrophysiological  studies in MS patients  have revealed  changes  of 
neuronal  coupling  in speciﬁc  frequency  ranges ( Hardmeier  et al., 2012 ; 
Schoonheim  et al., 2013 ; Sjøgård  et al., 2021 ; Tewarie  et al., 2013 ; 
Tewarie  et al., 2014 ). While these studies have largely focused  on phase- 
coupling  as a measure  of functional  connectivity,  recent ﬁndings  have 
highlighted  amplitude-coupling  as another  mode of neuronal  interac-  
tions that may provide  robust connectivity  information  non-redundant  
to phase-coupling  ( Brookes  et al., 2012 ; Daﬀertshofer  et al., 2018 ; 
Hipp et al., 2012 ; Mostame  and Sadaghiani,  2020 ; Siems et al., 2016 ; 
Siems and Siegel, 2020 ; Sjøgård  et al., 2021 ; Wens et al., 2014 ). Thus, 
we employed  our new analysis  approach  to resting-state  MEG record-  
ings, ﬁrst, to jointly identify  features  of cortical  phase- and amplitude-  
coupling  that can dissociate  MS patients  from healthy  controls,  and sec- 
ond, to investigate  if these features  diﬀer between  amplitude-  and phase- 
coupling.  
Our analysis  approach  identiﬁed  a set of principle  phase- and 
amplitude-coupling  modes that allowed  to successfully  classify  (84% 
correct)  RRMS patients  and controls.  Importantly,  both coupling  mea- 
sures showed  signiﬁcant  and non-redundant  changes  of neuronal  cou- 
pling over a broad range of frequencies  and cortical  networks.  Our re- 
sults highlight  non-invasive  electrophysiological  coupling  measures  as 
powerful  new biomarkers  of Multiple  Sclerosis  and provide  a proof-of-  
principle  for a novel approach  to aid the exploration  of high-dimensional  
coupling  data.

2.1. Subjects  and dataset 
We analyzed  MEG data from two datasets.  The ﬁrst dataset was 
recorded  at the MEG-Center  Tübingen  and included  eyes-open  resting-  
state MEG measurements  from 34 subjects.  17 of these subjects  (8 fe- 
male, mean age ( ± std) 31.1 ± 9.6 years) were diagnosed  with relapsing-  
remitting  MS (RRMS)  and 17 subjects  were healthy  controls  (9 female,  
mean age ( ± std) 28.4 ± 4.2 years, p = 0.30). The patient group was 
measured  prior to the ﬁrst application  of Tecﬁdera  (dimethyl  fumarate;  
BioGen  Inc., Cambridge,  MA, USA) with a median  disease  duration  
of 1 month (0–3 years interquartile  range, maximum  11 years). Pa-

1. Introduction  
The literature  on resting state fMRI functional  connectivity  (FC) 
in aging and Alzheimer  disease  (AD) is extensive  1 . The consensus  
view is that FC generally  becomes  weaker  with advancing  age, espe- 
cially within the default mode network  (DMN) ( Spreng and Schacter  
2012 ; Ferreira  and Busatto  2013 ; Dennis and Thompson  2014 ; Sala- 
Llonch et al., 2015; Damoiseaux  2017 ). Similar  ﬁndings  have been re- 
ported in AD ( Greicius  et al., 2004 ; Mevel et al., 2011 ), i.e., promi- 
nent FC decreases  especially  within the DMN. Importantly,  it is the 
DMN in which the characteristic  distribution  of neuropathology  is 
most prominent  in AD (amyloid  beta (A 𝛽)/tau accumulation,  atrophy)  
( Matthews  et al., 2013 ; Sheline  and Raichle  2013 ; Dennis and Thomp-  
son 2014 ; Forouzannezhad  et al., 2019 ). Thus, it has been suggested  
that loss of FC in higher order functional  systems,  especially  the DMN, 
may be more prominent  in AD as compared  to aging ( Jones et al., 2011 ; 
Toepper  2017 ; Chhatwal  et al., 2018 ; Lin et al., 2018 ). However,  this 
inference  is based on relatively  few studies,  which leaves open the ques- 
tion of whether  the eﬀects of healthy  aging vs. AD are distinguishable  
strictly on the basis of FC. 
Autosomal  dominant  AD (ADAD),  an uncommon  variant ( ∼1% of 
all cases), deﬁned  by mutations  in presenilin  1, presenilin  2, or amy- 
loid precursor  protein  (APP) genes causes symptomatic  disease  in rel- 
atively young patients.  Longitudinal  studies of ADAD and late onset 
AD (LOAD)  demonstrate  similar pathology:  A 𝛽plaques  develop  early 
( Bateman  et al., 2012 ; Gordon  et al., 2018 ; McDade  et al., 2018 ) fol- 
lowed by tau accumulation,  neurodegeneration,  and ﬁnally cognitive  
decline  ( Bateman  et al., 2012 ; Potter et al., 2013 ; Almkvist  et al., 2017 ). 
Importantly,  unlike LOAD, ADAD occurs in younger  individuals.  This 
diﬀerence  oﬀers a means of disentangling  the eﬀects of aging vs. pathol- 
ogy by studying  AD in the absence  of advanced  age. Apart from age 
of onset, ADAD diﬀers from LOAD in the distribution  of neuropathol-  
ogy, speciﬁcally,  greater subcortical  atrophy  and A 𝛽/tau deposition  
( Tentolouris-Piperas  et al., 2017 ; Luckett  et al., 2021 ). Notwithstand-  
ing this diﬀerence,  the available  evidence  suggests  that the FC mani- 
festations  of ADAD and LOAD are similar at comparable  disease  stages 
( Thomas  et al., 2014 ; Chhatwal  et al., 2018 ). However,  a head-to-head  
comparison  of FC in ADAD vs. LOAD, rigorously  controlling  for age, has 
not so far been reported.  
Almost all prior work on FC in aging and AD has been cast in 
terms of either Pearson  correlation,  which is normalized,  and there- 
fore, invariant  with respect to signal amplitude,  e.g., ( Damoiseaux  2017 , 
Jalilianhasanpour  et al. 2019 ), or ICA of time series normalized  to unit 
variance,  e.g., ( Chhatwal  et al. 2018 , Forouzannezhad  et al. 2019 ). 
These analyses  remove  from consideration  systematic  diﬀerences  in the 
amplitude  of spontaneous  fMRI signal ﬂuctuations.  However,  decreases  
in the amplitude  of fMRI signal ﬂuctuations  have been reported  in as- 
sociation  with old age ( Garrett  et al., 2010 ; Grady and Garrett  2014 ; 
Vieira et al., 2020 ) as well as neurodegenerative  disorders  including  
AD ( Luo et al., 2015 ; Mascali  et al., 2015 ; Kazemifar  et al., 2017 ; 
Marchitelli  et al., 2018 ) 2 . These prior results suggest  that insight can be 
gained by systematically  comparing  FC evaluated  with vs. without  signal 
normalization.  This is most naturally  done by comparing  correlation-  
based FC to covariance-based  FC, which is computationally  identical  
except for omission  of normalization  ( Varoquaux  et al., 2010 ). 
1 As of October  21, 2021, a PubMed  search on “resting state fMRI AND ag- 
ing ” returned  1377 hits of which 61 were reviews.  “Resting  state fMRI AND 
Alzheimer  disease ”returned  1098 hits of which 89 were reviews.  
2 The amplitude  of spontaneous  fMRI signal ﬂuctuations  has been variably  
evaluated  as the temporal  standard  deviation  (SD BOLD ) Garrett et al., (2010) . 
""Blood oxygen level-dependent  signal variability  is more than just noise."" 
J Neurosci  30 (14): 4914–4921.  or as root mean squared power summed  over a 
deﬁned spectral range (ALFF) Zuo et al., (2010) .. ""The oscillating  brain: complex  
and reliable.""  Neuroimage  49 (2): 1432–1445.  The algebraic  distinction  between  
these measures  is negligible.  We adopt an extant data-driven  approach  based on whole-brain  
sampling  of resting state BOLD fMRI signals from 222 regions  
of interest  (ROIs) representing  12 resting state networks  (RSNs; 
Fig. 1 )( Seitzman  et al., 2020 ). Representing  FC data in a space of rela- 
tively low dimension  using established  techniques,  e.g., principal  com- 
ponent analysis,  simpliﬁes  distinguishing  between  the eﬀects of aging 
vs. AD and ADAD vs. LOAD. This is accomplished  by assessing  group 
diﬀerences  in terms of components  ( Madsen  et al., 2017 ). As will be 
shown below, almost all systems-level  structure  in 222 ×222 covari- 
ance and correlation  matrices  can be represented  with only 30 compo-  
nents. A component-based  approach  to assessing  group diﬀerences  in 
FC also enables  distinguishing  between  the eﬀects of age vs. AD using 
straightforward  regression.  
We address  three questions:  (1) Do the eﬀects of age and AD man- 
ifest diﬀerently  in covariance-  vs. correlation-base  based FC? (2) what 
FC features  distinguish  AD (ADAD and LOAD) from healthy  aging; (3) 
what FC diﬀerences,  if any, distinguish  ADAD from LOAD across clin- 
ical disease  stages as measured  by Clinical  Dementia  Rating (CDR TM ). 
To this end, we analyze  covariance-  and correlation-based  FC evaluated  
globally  over the entire brain. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
ADAD participants  ( Table 1 ) were drawn from 14 international  sites 
in the Dominantly  Inherited  Alzheimer  Network  (DIAN)  observational  
study ( www.dian-info.org  ). The DIAN recruits  and follows  families  with 
disease-causing  mutations  in APP, PSEN1,  and PSEN2 ( Bateman  et al., 
2012 ). The DIAN cohort included  mutation  carriers  (MC, N = 123) and 
corresponding  non-carrier  family members  (NC; N = 83) who served as 
controls.  Data utilized  here were derived  from the 11th semiannual  data 
freeze. 
Institutional  review boards at Washington  University  in Saint Louis 
and participating  institutions  approved  the protocols.  
Data for LOAD participants  was drawn from ongoing  studies of ag- 
ing and AD from the Charles  F. and Joanne  Knight Alzheimer  Disease  
Research  Center (ADRC)  at Washington  University  School of Medicine  
(WUSM).  All participants  or their legal representative  provided  written  
informed  consent.  The institutional  review board at Washington  Univer-  
sity in Saint Louis approved  the protocols.  
We analyzed  data obtained  in cognitively  normal  participants  with 
( N = 51) and without  ( N = 131) biomarker  evidence  (amyloid  PET) of 
preclinical  LOAD and cognitively  impaired  participants  with biomarker  
evidence  of LOAD ( N = 50). Demographics  are listed in Table 1 ; 25 
participants  were excluded  owing to excessive  head motion.  
2.2. Disease staging 
Disease  stage was deﬁned  by the Clinical  Dementia  Rating (CDR TM ) 
( Morris 1993 ). CDR scores of 0, 0.5, and ≥ 1 indicate,  respectively,  nor- 
mal cognitive  status, very mild dementia,  and mild to moderate  demen-  
tia. Amyloid  (A 𝛽) positivity  was deﬁned  by either [ 11 C]Pittsburgh  com- 
pound B (PiB)( Klunk et al., 2004 ) or [ 18 F]ﬂorbetapir  PET ( Wong et al., 
2010 ). A 𝛽positivity  was deﬁned,  for PiB, as mean cortical  binding  po- 
tential (MCBP)  ≥ 0.18 ( Su et al., 2013 ) and, for ﬂorbetapir,  a standard-  
ized uptake value ratio (SUVR)  ≥ 1.2 ( Mishra et al., 2017 ).

correlation-based  sliding window  (CSW) techniques  and observed  a 
strong association  between  the two methods  when using absolute  val- 
ues of CSW. Finally,  Honari et al. (2021) critically  evaluated  a number  
of diﬀerent  WPS and IPS methods  for evaluating  PS, introducing  several 
new WPS methods  and a new method  within the IPS framework  denoted  
the cosine of the relative  phase (CRP). Their results indicated  that using 
CRP within an IPS framework  outperformed  other tested methods.  
A beneﬁt of using the IPS approach  is that it oﬀers single time- 
point resolution  of time-resolved  fMRI connectivity  and does not require  
choosing  a predeﬁned  window  length as is the case when using, for ex- 
ample, CSW. However,  a shortcoming  involves  the need to bandpass  ﬁl- 
ter the data prior to analysis  in order to accurately  estimate  the instanta-  
neous phases.  This requirement  stems from the fact that in order for the 
instantaneous  phases obtained  using the Hilbert transform  to be phys- 
ically meaningful,  the signal must be suﬃciently  narrow-bandpassed  
to approximate  a monocomponent  signal. To circumvent  the need to 
a priori choose the type and cut-oﬀfrequencies  for the bandpass  ﬁlter, 
researchers  are increasingly  exploring  the use of various  mode decom-  
position  (MD) techniques  that allow for the data-driven  decomposition  
of signals into narrow-band  components  centered  at diﬀerent  frequen-  
cies. It should be noted that while these approaches  circumvent  the need 
to prespecify  the ﬁlter that provide  a narrow-bandpass  signal, they do 
require  choosing  certain parameters  values in advance  depending  on 
the approach  (e.g., stoppage  criteria).  However,  in contrast  to classic 
ﬁltering  they provide  a collection  of bandpass  ﬁlters that allow one to 
conduct  analysis  at diﬀerent  frequencies.  
As an example,  the Hilbert-Huang  Transform  (HHT) ( Huang et al., 
1998 ) combines  a MD technique,  Empirical  Mode Decomposition  
(EMD),  with the Hilbert transform.  The EMD step decomposes  the sig- 
nal into a ﬁnite set of time-varying  oscillatory  functions  referred  to as 
intrinsic  mode functions  (IMFs).  The second step of the HHT involves  
the application  of the Hilbert transform  to each IMF generated  using 
EMD to obtain their time-varying  measures  of instantaneous  phase. The 
HHT provides  a data-driven  tool for time-frequency  analysis,  that is able 
to handle signals that are inherently  non-linear  and non-stationary.  In 
this paper we similarly  focus on using EMD and other related MD tech- 
niques as alternatives  to bandpass  ﬁltering  the data prior to applying  
the Hilbert transform  and evaluating  PS. 
There exists multiple  types of MD techniques  that can be used to de- 
compose  the data into its IMFs. The simplest  version  is standard  EMD 
which can be applied  to a single univariate  signal. This procedure  is 
performed  through  a recursive  algorithm  that uses the local extrema  in 
the signal to estimate  its upper and lower envelopes.  These envelops  are 
then used to obtain IMFs using the so-called  sifting process.  This involves  
averaging  the envelopes  to compute  the local mean, thus providing  a 
low-frequency  estimate  of the signal. Removing  the local mean from 
the signal allows one to recover  a high-frequency  oscillatory  mode (i.e., 
an IMF). The process  is repeated  until all oscillatory  modes in the signal 
have been obtained.  It has been demonstrated  ( Flandrin  et al., 2004; 
Rehman  and Mandic,  2010; Wu and Huang,  2004 ) that IMFs obtained  
using standard  EMD provides  frequency  responses  similar to those ob- 
tained using a dyadic ﬁlter bank (i.e., a ﬁlter bank dividing  a signal into 
a collection  of successively  band-limited  components  in which while de- 
scending  the frequency  scale, successive  frequency  bands have half the 
width of their predecessors  ( Vouras and Tran, 2005 )). In other words, 
EMD behaves  as a ﬁlter bank of overlapping  bandpass  ﬁlters and the 
frequency  content  of the IMFs obtained  decreases  from one IMF to the 
following  one. 
EMD is designed  to be performed  on univariate  signals.  In order to 
perform  a bivariate  or multivariate  analysis,  the decomposition  needs 
to be performed  simultaneously  and jointly for several reasons.  First, 
the computation  of the local mean, which depends  on ﬁnding  local ex- 
trema for multivariate  signals,  is not straightforward.  This is because  
the concept  of local extrema  is not well deﬁned  for multivariate  signals 
and the notion of the oscillatory  modes deﬁning  an IMF is convoluted  
( Mandic  and Goh, 2009; Rehman  and Mandic,  2010 ). Second,  to allow for mode alignment  across signals and alleviate  frequency  mismatch  be- 
tween the decomposed  IMFs, they need to be matched  both in number  
and frequency  ( Looney  and Mandic,  2009 ). 
Bivariate  EMD (BEMD)  ( Tanaka  and Mandic,  2007 ) combines  the 
two signals being analyzed  into a single complex  signal and thereafter  
computes  its envelopes.  If analyzing  more than two signals,  this ap- 
proach can be applied  in a pair-wise  manner.  However,  in this setting the 
alignment  of the bivariate  IMFs among all pairs is not guaranteed  glob- 
ally. This necessitated  the development  of multivariate  EMD (MEMD)  
which ensures  global mode alignment  across all IMFs ( Rehman  and 
Mandic,  2010 ). This is achieved  by forming  multiple  real-valued  pro- 
jections  of the signal, and using them to obtain multi-dimensional  en- 
velopes  via interpolation.  
While MEMD addresses  mode alignment  and guarantees  that the 
same number  of IMFs are extracted  from each multivariate  input sig- 
nal, it is susceptible  to mode mixing (i.e., the mixture  of frequency  
content  from one IMF to another).  In addition,  the manner  in which 
IMFs are chosen can be driven by noise. This led to the introduction  
of noise-assisted  multivariate  EMD (na-MEMD)  ( Colominas  et al., 2012; 
Yeh et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017 ) where additional  input signals gen- 
erated from Gaussian  white noise (WN) are introduced.  The structure  of 
the frequency  response  that MEMD imposes  on Gaussian  WN is similar 
to that of a dyadic ﬁlter bank ( Vouras and Tran, 2005 ). Hence, MEMD 
behaves  as a bank of bandpass  ﬁlters and the frequency  content  of the 
obtained  IMFs decrease  in subsequent  IMFs. Thus, when Gaussian  WN 
is added to the input signal this allows the intrinsic  oscillations  to be 
ﬁltered  adaptively  to their appropriate  scales. 
Another  noise assisted  variant of MD includes  ensemble  EMD 
(EEMD)  which leverages  the dyadic ﬁlter bank property  by adding Gaus- 
sian WN directly  to the signal ( Wu and Huang,  2009 ). This procedure  
is repeatedly  performed,  and for each iteration  a diﬀerent  realization  of 
WN is used. The output IMFs are obtained  by averaging  the correspond-  
ing IMFs from the whole ensemble.  However,  determining  optimal  val- 
ues for the noise level and number  of ensembles  is not trivial. Further,  
adding too much noise directly  to the signal can degrade  results.  This 
approach  is outside  the scope of this paper as previous  work has shown 
that na-MEMD  outperforms  EEMD ( Zhang et al., 2017 ). 
It should be noted that the EMD variants  discussed  earlier are only 
partially  able to address  the limitations  on sensitivity  to noise and mode 
mixing.  This is true because  EMD is based on the use of signal extrema,  
and in general  the extrema  of a sampled  signal may diﬀer from its 
continuous-time  version.  A consequence  is the local mean may intro- 
duce artefacts  associated  with how sampling  is performed  ( Rilling and 
Flandrin,  2009 ). In addition,  EMD is a recursive  process  whose results 
depend  on various  algorithmic  choices,  including  which interpolation  
scheme  and stopping  criteria  is used ( ur Rehman  and Aftab, 2019 ). 
Given these concerns,  Dragomiretskiy  and Zosso (2013) introduced  a 
non-recursive  Variational  Mode Decomposition  (VMD) technique  where 
the modes are extracted  concurrently.  Here an optimization  problem  
is formulated  where the cost function  to be minimized  is the sum of 
bandwidths  of all signal modes subject to the constraint  that the modes 
reconstruct  the input signal. ur Rehman  and Aftab (2019) introduced  a 
generic  extension  of VMD for multivariate  data, referred  to as Multivari-  
ate Variational  Mode Decomposition  (MVMD),  where the cost function  
is extended  to minimize  the sum of bandwidths  of all signal modes across 
all multivariate  input signals.  
EMD approaches  have already  been successfully  applied  to rs-fMRI  
data. For example,  Honari et al. (2021) compared  PS analysis  on rs-fMRI  
data using data extracted  via the Hilbert transform  and BEMD. Further,  
Zhou et al. (2020) used MEMD to analyze  TVC in rs-fMRI  for use in 
prediction  and classiﬁcation  of sleep quality.  In this work, we therefore  
primarily  focus on the use of na-MEMD  and MVMD for evaluating  TVC 
using rs-fMRI  within the PS framework.  
It is important  to note that there exist several alternative  approaches  
towards  decomposing  signal into frequency  components.  For example,  
the Fourier  transform  is well-suited  when the data is linear and periodic  
2  H. Honari and M.A. Lindquist NeuroImage  261 (2022) 119519 
or stationary.  However,  the Fourier  basis functions  are global, and thus 
cannot handle local non-linearity  without  signiﬁcant  spreading  across 
frequencies.  This is particularly  true when the waveforms  deviate  sig- 
niﬁcantly  from a sinusoidal  form. Another  example,  the wavelet  trans- 
form, is basically  an adjustable  window  Fourier  transform,  which can 
capture  localised  information  in the time-frequency  domain  due to its 
multi-scale  property.  It therefore  provides  a better approach  than the 
Fourier  transform  for non-stationary  signals.  However,  this approach  
has a non-adaptive  nature and once the mother  wavelet  is chosen,  it 
cannot be changed  during the analysis.  Further,  it is not suitable  for the 
analysis  of non-linear  data. In contrast,  MD techniques  are data driven 
and adaptive  in terms of decomposing  the signal into modes. Finally,  
a method  that is suitable  for non-stationary  signals,  can be applied  to 
stationary  signals as well; however,  the opposite  is not possible.  For ex- 
ample, the Fourier  transform  can handle stationary  signals,  but cannot 
be used for non-stationary  signals.  The ability of MD techniques  to han- 
dle non-linear,  non-stationary  time series make them particularly  suit- 
able for the analysis  of rs-fMRI  time series data ( Allen et al., 2014; Guan 
et al., 2020 ). 
The paper is organized  as follows.  We begin by introducing  stan- 
dard univariate  EMD and describing  the algorithm  used to decompose  
an input signal into IMFs. Next, we discuss variants  of EMD that can 
be used for multivariate  decomposition  of multiple  signals jointly into 
IMFs rather than decomposing  each signal independently.  These include  
BEMD, MEMD,  and na-MEMD.  Finally,  MVMD is introduced  as an alter- 
native decomposition  approach  that mitigates  issues related to mode 
mixing and sensitivity  to noise often observed  in EMD approaches.  The 
paper concludes  by comparing  the methods  using a series of simulations,  
and applying  MVMD-based  phase synchronization  to rs-fMRI  data. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Empirical  mode decomposition  techniques  
To obtain the instantaneous  phase ( Boccaletti  et al., 2018 ) of a real 
signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) one must ﬁrst construct  an analytic  signal: 
𝑧 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑗{ 𝑥 ( 𝑡 )} (1) 
where 𝑗 = √
−1 and represents  the Hilbert transform.  This signal can 
be re-expressed  as follows:  
𝑧 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝔄 ( 𝑡 ) exp (𝑗𝜙( 𝑡 ) )(2) 
where 𝔄 ( 𝑡 ) represents  the envelope  and 𝜙( 𝑡 ) the instantaneous  phase. 
An important  consideration  when computing  instantaneous  
phase is the need for 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) to satisfy Bedrosian’s  Product  Theorem  
( Bedrosian,  1963 ), which states that a band-limited  signal can be 
decomposed  into the product  of envelope  and phase when their spectra  
are disjoint.  A necessary  condition  for this to hold is that 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is ﬁrst 
narrow-banded  by applying  a bandpass  ﬁlter. Choosing  the type and 
bandwidth  for the bandpass  ﬁlter required  to perform  the analysis  is 
one of the greater challenges  when using these types of approaches.  In 
addition,  ambiguities  can persist whether  the chosen bandpass  ﬁlter 
actually  ensures  that the signal is suﬃciently  narrow-band  for applying  
the Hilbert transform  to construct  the analytic  signal. Therefore,  we 
seek more data-driven  alternatives  for achieving  the equivalent  goals. 
One such alternative  is the Hilbert Huang transform,  which is EMD 
followed  by the Hilbert transform.  Here EMD is used in place of band- 
pass ﬁltering.  EMD oﬀers a data-driven  way to decompose  the signal 
of interest  into a series of IMFs that correspond  to diﬀerent  frequency  
bands. An IMF is a function  where the number  of extrema  and zero- 
crossings  diﬀer at most by one, and the mean value of the upper (deﬁned  
by the local maxima)  and lower envelopes  (deﬁned  by the local minima)  
is equal to zero. The IMFs are zero-mean  amplitude-frequency  modu- 
lated signals,  designed  to ensure that Bedrosian’s  theorem  is respected  
and that subsequent  application  of the Hilbert transform  will result in 
physically  meaningful  instantaneous  phases of the input signal ( Huang,  2014; ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011 ). Together,  these IMFs form a set 
of approximately  orthogonal  basis that can be used to reconstruct  the 
input signal. The ﬁrst IMF consists  of the largest frequency  oscillation  
present  in the signal, and each subsequent  IMF consists  of increasingly  
smaller  frequency  oscillations  than those previously  extracted.  
The practical  implementation  of EMD is described  in Algorithm  1 in 
the Supplementary  Material,  where Steps 2–6 are referred  to as the sift- 
ing process ( Huang et al., 1998 ). The ﬁrst step is to identify  all the local 
extrema  present  in the input signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) . All local maxima  are connected  
using a cubic spline which create an upper envelope  for the signal. Sim- 
ilarly, all local minima  are used to create a lower envelope.  The two 
envelopes  create an upper and lower bound for the data. The mean 𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) 
is computed  by taking their average.  The diﬀerence  between  the data 
and mean, 𝑑( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) , is considered  a candidate  IMF. This process  
is repeated  until a stoppage  criterion  is fulﬁlled,  and the current  value 
of 𝑑( 𝑡 ) is designated  as an IMF. Once, the IMF is set it is subtracted  from 
the signal and the sifting process  is performed  on the new signal. This 
process  is repeated,  each time removing  the previously  deﬁned  set of 
IMFs from 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) , until the desired  number  of IMFs have been obtained.  
The stoppage  criterion  used in EMD determines  the number  of sifting 
steps that are performed  when deriving  IMFs. 
There are a number  of commonly  used stoppage  criterion,  and in 
this paper we use the threshold  method  ( Rilling et al., 2003 ). This cri- 
terion is based on imposing  two thresholds  𝜃1 and 𝜃2 aimed at ensuring  
globally  small ﬂuctuations  in the mean while taking locally large ex- 
cursions  into consideration  ( Rilling et al., 2003 ). Let us deﬁne the am- 
plitude as 𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) ∶= ( 𝑒 max ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑒 min ( 𝑡 ))∕2 , where 𝑒 max ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑒 min ( 𝑡 ) are the 
upper and lower envelope,  respectively,  and the evaluation  function  as 
𝜎( 𝑡 ) ∶= |𝑚 ( 𝑡 )∕ 𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) |. The sifting process  is repeated  until 𝜎( 𝑡 ) < 𝜃1 for some 
fraction  (1 − 𝛼) of the total number  of iterations  and 𝜎( 𝑡 ) < 𝜃2 for the 
remaining  fraction.  The recommended  values for these thresholds  pro- 
posed by Rilling et al. (2003) , which we use in this paper, are 𝛼≈0 . 05 , 
𝜃1 ≈0 . 05 , and 𝜃2 ≈1 0 𝜃1 . 
2.1.1. Bivariate  empirical  mode decomposition  
Often it is of interest  to extract IMFs from a collection  of signals.  A 
simple approach  is to apply the standard  EMD algorithm  separately  to 
each signal and extract a set of IMFs from each. However,  this does not 
guarantee  that the frequencies  of the extracted  IMFs match across sig- 
nals, nor will the repeated  application  of the EMD algorithm  necessarily  
produce  the same number  of IMFs for all signals.  This is particularly  
problematic  within the PS framework,  where one seeks to compare  sig- 
nals within the same frequency  band. To circumvent  this issue and allow 
for the decomposition  of a bivariate  or multivariate  signal, various  ex- 
tensions  of EMD have been proposed  that perform  the decomposition  
jointly ( ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011 ). 
To decompose  bivariate  signals,  EMD should be performed  so 
that the decomposition  and sifting process  is applied  on the enve- 
lope of the bivariate  signal. This ensures  that the number  and fre- 
quency  of the decomposed  IMFs corresponding  to each signal match. 
Rilling et al. (2007) proposed  an extension  of EMD, referred  to as 
BEMD, for handling  signal pairs. Here the bivariate  signal is treated 
as a complex-valued  signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) to simplify  representation.  In general,  
given a set of directions  in the complex  plane, BEMD follows  the same 
algorithm  as EMD except that the sifting process  is performed  jointly on 
the signal pair. Thus, for bivariate  signals the looping  of the algorithm  is 
performed  in the directions  𝜋and 2 𝜋. In each direction  all extrema  are 
extracted  and the set of points interpolated  using cubic splines to obtain 
the envelopes.  The envelopes  corresponding  to these directions  are av- 
eraged to obtain the local mean. The practical  implementation  of BEMD 
is described  in Algorithm  2 ( Rilling et al., 2007 ) in the Supplementary  
Material.  
2.1.2. Multivariate  empirical  mode decomposition  
While BEMD addresses  the misalignment  of IMFs for a given pair of 
signals,  it does not guarantee  that the IMFs will be aligned  globally  if 
3  H. Honari and M.A. Lindquist NeuroImage  261 (2022) 119519 
applied  in a pair-wise  manner  to the components  of a multivariate  signal 
consisting  of more than two signals.  To ensure that the same number  of 
IMFs are produced  and to avoid the misalignment  of the IMFs when ana- 
lyzing more than two signals,  multivariate  extensions  of EMD have been 
proposed.  For example,  an extension  to the trivariate  case was proposed  
by ur Rehman  and Mandic  (2010) and a more general  multivariate  case 
by Rehman  and Mandic  (2010) . 
The latter extension  involves  processing  the signals directly  in mul- 
tidimensional  space. First, the signal is projected  along diﬀerent  di- 
rections  in 𝑛 -dimensional  space. Using the projections,  multiple  𝑛 - 
dimensional  envelopes  are computed,  which are used to obtain the local 
mean. Calculation  of the local mean can be thought  of as an approxima-  
tion of the integral  of all envelopes  in multiple  directions  in ℝ 𝑛 . The ac- 
curacy of this integral  is bounded  by how uniformly  the direction  vectors  
used to perform  the projections  are selected.  The direction  vectors  in 𝑛 - 
dimensional  space can be represented  by points on a multi-dimensional  
sphere of unit radius. Hence, the problem  becomes  ﬁnding  a uniform  
sampling  scheme  on the sphere.  This can be obtained  either using uni- 
form angular  sampling  or sampling  based on low-discrepancy  point sets. 
While the ﬁrst scheme  provides  a simple and easy way for sampling  a 
unit sphere in ℝ 𝑛 , it does not provide  a uniform  sampling  distribution  as 
it gives rise to higher density  closer to the poles. Thus, the second sam- 
pling scheme,  which relies on the concept  of discrepancy  (a measure  of 
the non-uniformity  of a distribution)  to create a uniform  point set on 
spheres  is leveraged.  A standard  approach  for obtaining  such a point set 
is based on the Hammersley  sequence  ( Cui and Freeden,  1997 ). 
Given the set of direction  vectors  obtained  using the aforementioned  
sampling  scheme,  the projections  𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) , for 𝑡 = 1 …𝑇 , of the input signal 
𝐱( 𝑡 ) along directions  𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 𝑘 in multidimensional  space are calculated  as 
𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐱( 𝑡 ) 𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 𝑘 . Thereafter,  the time instants  { 𝑡 𝜑 𝑘 
𝑗 } corresponding  to 
the maxima  of the projection  𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) are determined.  These extrema  are 
interpolated  via cubic spline interpolation  to get a series of multivariate  
signal envelopes  𝐞 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) . The local mean is computed  by averaging  the 
envelopes.  This is followed  by the sifting process  to extract the IMFs 
from the multivariate  data until the stoppage  criterion  is met for all the 
projected  signals.  The implementation  of MEMD is shown in Algorithm  
3 ( Huang,  2014; Rehman  and Mandic,  2010 ) in the Supplementary  Ma- 
terial.

Fig. 1. Illustration  of the inversion-free  inference  on change (BENCH).  Consider  a toy model with two parameters  and two measurements   ( 𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 ) = [ 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 ] . Each 
oval in the parameter  space (left) corresponds  to a single point in the measurement  space (right) with the same colour; meaning  that there is a one to many mapping  
from measurements  to parameters  (i.e., the model is degenerate).  Despite the degeneracies  we are able to estimate  which of the parameters  best explains  the change 
in the measurements.  We do so by comparing  the observed  change ( Δ𝑦 ) with the expected  change in the measurements  ( 𝜇1 , 𝜇2 ) as a result of each hypothesised  
pattern of change ( ̂Δ𝑣 1 , ̂Δ𝑣 2 ). 
rameter  estimation  (see Fig. 1 , also refer to Appendix  A for more details 
about directly  inferring  changes).  Our approach  proceeds  in two steps: 
First, we use simulated  data generated  from a forward  model to train 
models that calculate  how each parameter  aﬀects the measurements.  
Once these models of change have been trained  for all hypothetical  pat- 
terns of change,  we use them to infer the posterior  probability  of which 
pattern  of change in parameter(s)  can best explain  the change between  
real datasets.  We call this approach  BENCH,  which stands for Bayesian  
EstimatioN  of CHange.  
When confronted  with a degenerate  biophysical  model, BENCH  
makes a diﬀerent  set of assumptions  from the traditional  approach  of 
ﬁxing some parameters  and identifying  any change in the remaining  
free parameters.  When comparing  patients  and controls,  the traditional  
approach  assumes  that the prior values for the ﬁxed parameters  hold 
across the region of interest  in both groups.  Hence, any change of sig- 
nal across the region of interest  between  the two groups is assumed  
to be fully explained  by the predetermined  set of free parameters.  In 
contrast,  by not relying on model inversion,  BENCH  can work directly  
with the degenerate  biophysical  model without  ﬁxing any parameters.  
However,  this comes at the price of limiting  the change to some prede- 
termined  set of possible  patterns  set by the user (e.g., parameter  A could 
change,  or parameter  B increases  by the same amount  as parameter  C 
decreases).  While the number  of such proposed  microstructural  changes  
can be large, each of them has to be sparse (i.e., they have fewer degrees  
of freedom  than the number  of free parameters  that could be estimated  
using the conventional  approach).  In this work, we will limit ourselves  
to changes  of just one parameter  at a time for the sake of simplicity  of 
explanation.  
BENCH  is applicable  to any situation  where we are interested  in 
comparing  the parameters  of a generative  (bio)physical  model across 
diﬀerent  conditions.  Here we apply the framework  to diﬀusion  MRI mi- 
crostructure  modelling.  As an example  use case, we studied  microstruc-  
tural changes  in White Matter Hyperintensities  (WMH),  which are extra 
bright regions  that are commonly  seen in T2-weighted  images at spe- 
ciﬁc brain regions  in elderly people.  Despite  the abundance  and clinical  
implications  of WMHs ( Debette  and Markus,  2010; Prins and Scheltens,  
2015 ), the underlying  changes  in the histopathology  and microstructure  
remain unknown  ( Gouw et al., 2011; Wardlaw  et al., 2013 ). 
The structure  of this paper is as follows.  In the Theory section,  we 
present  the general  inference  method  and how we train the models of 
change.  In the Methods  section,  we cover the diﬀusion-speciﬁc  materi-  als including  the computation  of summary  measurements  that are used 
to represent  diﬀusion  data and the microstructural  model for diﬀusion  
MRI. In the Results section,  we ﬁrst demonstrate  the ability of our model 
in detecting  the underlying  parameter  changes  using simulated  data. We 
then apply the method  to study microstructural  changes  in white mat- 
ter hyperintensities  as an example  application.  In the Discussion  section,  
the potential  applications,  limitations,  and possible  future directions  of 
this work are presented.  
2. Theory  
2.1. Inference  on change in parameters  
Given a baseline  measurement  (y), an observed  change in the mea- 
surement  ( Δ𝑦 ), and a generative  biophysical  model (  ), we aim to in- 
vestigate  what pattern  of change ( ̂Δ𝑣 ) in the model parameters  ( 𝑣 ) can 
best explain  this observed  change in the measurements  ( Fig. 1 ). A pat- 
tern of change is a unit vector in the parameter  space, e.g. it can be a 
change in a single parameter  or any linear combination  of the model 
parameters.  For simplicity  of the explanations  and notation,  we only 
assume  a single parameter  change in the rest of paper, but all the equa- 
tions apply to any linear combination  of the parameters.  If the model 
is invertible,  we may directly  estimate  Δ𝑣 by inverting  the model on y 
and 𝑦 + Δ𝑦 to get the corresponding  parameter  estimates  and calculate  
the diﬀerences.  Alternatively,  in BENCH  we estimate  𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦, Δ𝑦 ) , that 
is the posterior  probability  for the pattern  of change ̂Δ𝑣 conditioned  on 
the observed  baseline  ( 𝑦 ) and change in the data( Δ𝑦 ). Using Bayes’ rule: 
𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦, Δ𝑦 ) = 𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) 𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦 ) 
∑
̂Δ𝑣 ′𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ′) 𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ′∣𝑦 ) (1) 
We assume  no prior preference  between  the patterns  of change given 
the baseline  measurements(i.e.  𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦 ) is uniform),  so to estimate  the 
posterior  probabilities  we only need to estimate  the likelihood  term 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 |𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) . The pattern  of change ̂Δ𝑣 represents  the direction  but not 
the amount  of the change in the parameters.  We therefore  marginalize  
the likelihood  with respect to the amount  of change ( |Δ𝑣 |) : 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) = ∫𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑑 |Δ𝑣 | (2) 
We assume  that the prior distribution  for the amount  of change follows  
a log-normal  pdf with a ﬁxed mean and scale parameter  (adjustable

Fig. 2. Distribution  of derivatives.  The way measurements  change as a result of a particular  change in the parameters  can only be calculated  if we know the baseline  
parameters.  When we are only given the measurements,  there are several instances  of equally likely derivative  directions  depending  on the underlying  baseline  
parameters.  We model all of these derivatives  given the baseline  measurements  as a random variable  with a presumed  distribution.  This allows us to transfer the 
uncertainty  due to the inverse model degeneracy  into the measurement  space. The blue oval in the parameter  space (left) represents  all the parameter  settings that 
map onto the same blue point in the measurement  space(right).  Each of these parameter  settings can produce  a diﬀerent  derivative  direction  in the measurements  
space. The collection  of such derivatives  of change ̂Δ𝑣 for the measurement  𝑦 are modelled  as a Gaussian  distribution  with mean 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) and covariance  Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) . (For 
interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
hyper parameters).  A log-normal  PDF is chosen to allow for changes  
across several order of magnitudes.  
The likelihood  term inside the integral,  𝑃 (Δy |y , ̂Δv , |Δv |) , deﬁnes 
how the measurements  change as a result of a fully characterised  vector 
of change in the parameters  with the given direction  ( ̂Δ𝑣 ) and amount  
( |Δ𝑣 |). To relate this parameter  change to a change in data one also 
needs to know the baseline  parameters  ( 𝑣 ), as 
Δ𝑦 =  ( 𝑣 + |Δ𝑣 |̂Δ𝑣 ) −  ( 𝑣 ) + 𝜖 (3) 
where 𝜖is the measurement  noise. However,  for a degenerate  biophys-  
ical model, we cannot estimate  a unique set of baseline  parameters  𝑣 
for which to estimate  Eq. (3) . While, one could integrate  over all pos- 
sible values of 𝑣 , this is a very high-dimensional  integral,  which would 
be very computationally  expensive.  Instead,  we propose  an alternative  
way to avoid the need of estimating  the baseline  parameters  to estimate  
the likelihood.  
Assuming  that |Δ𝑣 |is reasonably  small, and  is behaving  smoothly  
w.r.t 𝑣 , using a Taylor expansion  we can express  Δ𝑦 as: 
Δ𝑦 = ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) |Δ𝑣 |+ 𝜖 (4) 
Where ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) is the derivative  of  in the direction  of ̂Δ𝑣 at point 𝑣 , 
and 𝜖is the measurement  noise. Given the baseline  measurements  ( 𝑦 ), 
but not the baseline  parameters  ( 𝑣 ), there can be an inﬁnite  number  of 
∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) for a degenerate  model ( Fig. 2 ). To account  for all instances  
of the derivative,  we model ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  given 𝑦 as a random  variable  that 
follows  a normal  distribution  with hyperparameters  𝜇( 𝑦 ) and Σ( 𝑦 ) , i.e. 
∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑦 ) ∼𝑁( 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) , Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 )) (5) 
where 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 represents  the average  expected  change in the measurements  
as a result of change in parameters  in the direction  ̂Δ𝑣 , Σ̂Δ𝑣 represents  
the uncertainty  around this expectation  due to the unknown  baseline  
parameters  ( Fig. 2 ), and 𝑁( 𝑚, 𝐶) represents  a Gaussian  PDF with mean 
𝑚 and covariance  𝐶. This formulation  allows us to transfer  the uncer- 
tainty in the baseline  parameters  to an uncertainty  in the measurement  
space, which we can model and predict.  In the next section we will de- 
scribe a method  for estimating  𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) and Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) by training  regression  
models using simulated  data. Once we compute  these hyperparameters,  
by inserting  Eq. (5) back into Eq. (4) we can compute  the likelihood  term inside the integral  by 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) = 𝑁( |Δ𝑣 |𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) , |Δ𝑣 |2 Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) + Σ𝑛 ) (6) 
where Σ𝑛 is the noise covariance  matrix.  
Finally,  by computing  the integral  over the size of the parameter  
change in Eq. (2) numerically,  we are able to approximate  the likeli- 
hood function  𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) which we can then use in Eq. (1) yielding  
the desired  posterior  distribution  on the change in parameters.  More- 
over, using the approximation  of the likelihood  function  in Eq. (6) the 
posterior  probability  of the amount  of change for each direction  is pro- 
portional  to 
𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |∣Δ𝑦, 𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) ∝𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |) (7) 
Note that this likelihood  function  is unnormalized  so a high or low value 
doesn’t necessarily  reﬂect the quality of the change model in explain-  
ing the data. For such measure  please refer to Appendix  B . We can still 
estimate  the most likely amount  of change in the parameter  given the 
measurements  by ﬁnding  the |Δ𝑣 |that maximizes  the above posterior  
probability  (maximum  a posteriori  estimation).  Alternatively,  we can 
estimate  the expected  value of the amount  of change by integrating  this 
posterior  probability  distribution  multiplied  by |Δ𝑣 |over |Δ𝑣 |. 
2.2. Training  models of change 
In this section we describe  how to train a regression  model to esti- 
mate the hyperparameters  of the distribution  of ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) , namely  the 
average  ( 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) ) and uncertainty  ( Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) ) of change in the measurement  
( 𝑦 ) for a parameter  change ( ̂Δ𝑣 ). 
Given some baseline  parameters  ( 𝑣 ) one can calculate  the baseline  
measurements  as 𝑦 =  ( 𝑣 ) and approximate  the derivative  in direction  
̂Δ𝑣 using 
∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) ≈ lim 
𝑡 →0  ( 𝑣 + 𝑡 ̂Δ𝑣 ) −  ( 𝑣 ) 
𝑡 (8) 
Therefore,  by sampling  𝑣 from the parameter  space using a prior 
distribution,  we generate  a simulated  dataset of pairs [ 𝑦, ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ] that we 
use for training  regression  models.  
We use a regression  model parameterised  by 𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 to estimate  𝜇̂Δ𝑣 
as: 
𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ; 𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ) = 𝐹 ( 𝑦 ) .𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 (9) 
3  H. Raﬁpoor, Y.-Q. Zheng, L. Griﬀanti et al. NeuroImage  260 (2022) 119452 
where 𝐹 ( 𝑦 ) is the design matrix,  which depends  on arbitrary  aﬃne 
or non-linear  transformations  of 𝑦 . Note that the subscript  𝜇̂Δ𝑣 of the 
weights  indicates  that each pattern  of change in the parameters  has its 
own set of weights.  
We also employ  a regression  model for the uncertainty  hyperparam-  
eter Σ̂Δ𝑣 parameterised  by 𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 . However,  Σ̂Δ𝑣 must be positive  deﬁ- 
nite, which would not be guaranteed  when directly  estimating  Σ̂Δ𝑣 by 
training  an element-wise  regression  model. To account  for the positive  
deﬁnite  nature of Σ̂Δ𝑣 , we instead  train regression  models for elements  
of the lower triangular  matrix of its Cholesky  decomposition  ( 𝐿 ). Also, 
since the diagonal  elements  of the lower-triangular  matrix in Cholesky  
decomposition  must be non-negative,  we use their log-transform  in the 
regression  model. Hence 
Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ; 𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 ) =  ( 𝐹 ( 𝑦 ) .𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 ) (10) 
where  denotes  the transformation  of the regressed  vector to the full 
covariance  matrix that includes  the arrangement  of elements,  expo- 
nentiation  of the diagonals,  and the matrix multiplication  for inverse  
Cholesky  decomposition.  
Putting  back the above regression  models into Eq. (5) the likelihood  
of observing  pairs of baseline  measurements  and derivatives  in terms of 
the parameters  of regression  models is: 
𝐿 ( 𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 , 𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 ) = ∏
𝑖 𝑁(∇ ̂Δ𝑣  𝑖 ; 𝐹 ( 𝑦 𝑖 ) .𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ,  ( 𝐹 ( 𝑦 𝑖 ) .𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 )) (11) 
Accordingly,  we estimate  the optimal  weights  𝑤 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 , 𝑤 Σ̂Δ𝑣 by max- 
imizing  the above likelihood  function  for the simulated  pairs of 
[ 𝑦 𝑖 , ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  𝑖 ] using a combination  of the BFGS and Nelder-Mead  meth- 
ods as implemented  in SciPy ( Virtanen  et al., 2020 ). 
This procedure  is repeated  for each hypothetical  pattern  of change,  
yielding  two sets of weights  for the average  and uncertainty  of change,  
which we refer to as a “change  model ”. Once we estimated  these 
weights,  for any given baseline  measurement  we use the regression  mod- 
els in Eqs. (9) and (10) to estimate  the distribution  of derivatives  and 
then the desired  probability  distributions.  Figure 3 shows a schematic  
overview  of the inputs, outputs  and steps that are required  to train a 
change model, as well as how to use them to infer the change in param- 
eters. 
In this work, we used a second degree polynomial  function  of the 
data for the regression  models that estimate  the mean change ( 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ) 
from the baseline  measurements.  For the uncertainty  parameter  ( Σ̂Δ𝑣 ) a 
ﬁrst degree (linear)  model is chosen as we expect less variability  across 
samples  for this hyperparameter.  The weights  for the regression  models 
were estimated  using a maximum  likelihood  optimization  and a training  
dataset with 100,000  simulated  samples.

brain regions  individually.  The natural  candidate  for measuring  human 
brain structure  heterogeneity  in vivo is quantitative  MRI (qMRI);  The 
MRI’s multiple  sensitivities  to the local environment  of water protons  
allows for quantitative  estimations  of tissue properties  ( Weiskopf  et al., 
2021 ). The RN and SN stand out post mortem,  suggesting  that their tis- 
sue composition  is diﬀerent  from their environment.  Nevertheless,  these 
contrasts  are often not apparent  in vivo in MRI. The MRI image contrast  
depends  not only on the tissue composition  but also on the image resolu- 
tion and the acquisition  type. For example,  supplementary  Fig. 1 shows 
how a T1-weighted  contrast  might allow a clear distinction  of the PAG 
from its neighbouring  regions  but not the red nucleus,  and an R2 ∗ map 
will likely highlight  the RN and the SN, but little else. Recently,  neu- 
romelanin  MRI has been used to identify  the SN and the Locus coeruleus,  
relying on these regions’  high iron concentrations  ( Cassidy  et al., 2019 ; 
Isaias et al., 2016 ; Priovoulos  et al., 2020 ; Wengler  et al., 2020 ). Though  
this contrast  is successful  in isolating  these regions,  it does not provide  
a clear contrast  elsewhere  in the brain, and the midbrain  in particular.  
Currently,  popular  segmentation  programs  segment  the midbrain  
from the rest of the brain but do not provide  a ﬁner separation  of the 
midbrain  sub-regions  (e.g., FreeSurfer:  Iglesias  et al. 2015 ). More recent 
software  are able to detect more ﬁne scale subcortical  regions.  Even 
though they do not produce  a complete  segmentation  of every known 
structure  ( Garzón  et al., 2018 ), these segmentation  methods  are highly 
useful and provide  parcellation  of the main areas of interest  within 
the midbrain.  These parcellations  rely on anatomical  priors in an atlas 
space, high-resolution  data and/or multi-dimensional  quantitative  data 
( Bazin et al., 2020 ; Schneider  et al., 2021 ), which is not always avail- 
able. Hence, it would be beneﬁcial  to have a simple solution  for study- 
ing the midbrain  that can be complementary  to atlas-based  approaches.  
Ideally,  such a solution  would not rely on multiparametric  qMRI, will 
have minimum  anatomical  priors, and would have each individual  mid- 
brain remain in its native space in order to reduce any loss of infor- 
mation.  The importance  of studying  brain structure  in individual  space 
has led to tools which allow studying  the individual’s  cortical  surfaces  
( Fischl, 2012 ), white matter tracts ( Yeatman  et al., 2012 ; Yendiki  et al., 
2011 ), and subcortical  gradients  ( Drori et al., 2022 ). 
Here, we propose  that by relying on the midbrain  morphology,  its 
structure  can be sampled,  within subject space, in a way that maintains  
the information  of the diﬀerent  regions,  without  requiring  very high res- 
olution  and multi-dimensional  data. We ﬁrst show that we can sample 
quantitative  MRI data along three main axes of the left and right mid- 
brain, producing  proﬁles  that are similar across subjects.  We then show 
that the proﬁles  along the ﬁrst two axes sample the midbrain  in a way 
that nicely separates  the main structures,  i.e., the SN, RN, and PAG. We 
do so by comparing  our proﬁles  with a segmentation  of the midbrain  
(MASSP).  We further show that age diﬀerences  that can be detected  in 
high-resolution  ROI-based  analysis  are reﬂected  in the proﬁles.  Finally,  
we generalize  our analysis  and use the HCP data to show that the proﬁles  
can estimate  midbrain  characteristics  with metrics  such as the diﬀusion  
tensor and semi-quantitative  data such as a T1w/T2w  contrast.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Datasets  
2.1.1. Dataset I (AHEAD)  
Subjects  and data. We used the open source AHEAD  7T quantitative  
MRI dataset ( Alkemade  et al., 2020 ). Data were acquired  at the Spinoza  
centre for Neuroimaging  in Amsterdam,  using a Philips Achieva  7T MRI 
scanner.  Image resolution  is 0.7 mm isotropic.  The data includes  T1- 
weighted  (T1w) images as well as quantitative  R1, R2 ∗ and susceptibility  
maps (for full data acquisition  and analysis  see ( Alkemade  et al., 2020 )). 
The data consist of 105 subjects  aged 18–80 years. From these data we 
chose 67 subjects  who fall in one of two age groups:  young adults (N = 42, 
range 18–30 years; 27 females)  and older adults (N = 25, range 61–70 
years; 14 females).  Subjects’  exact ages were not available.  2.1.2. Dataset II (HUJID)  
The dataset was collected  as part of a previously  published  work; for

Subjects.  Measurements  were performed  on healthy  individuals  in two 
age groups:  22 young adults (11 females,  aged 27 ± 2.2 years, range 23–
31) and 17 older adults (4 females,  aged 67 ± 5.6 years, range 55–75).  
We excluded  1 older female subject from our analysis  due to a de- 
tected abnormality  in her caudate  nucleus.  All subjects  had R1 maps. 
17 younger  subjects  had R2 ∗ maps (7 females).  QSM was available  in 
15 younger  subjects  (7 females,  ages 27 ± 2.5 years), and 15 older sub- 
jects (3 females,  ages 67 ± 5.8 years). Furthermore,  3 subjects’  data was 
collected  twice, few days apart, for a scan-rescan  analysis  (1 female,

trolling  one’s emotional  responses.  This model applies to both positive  
and negative  emotions  ( Gross, 2015 ; Quoidbach  et al., 2015 ). 
1.2. Neural bases of negative  emotion  regulation  
Studies  using brain imaging  techniques  have investigated  the com- 
mon and distinct  neural bases of the emotion  regulation  strategies  
modeled  by Gross (1998) , including  Attentional  Deployment,  Cognitive  
Change,  and Response  Modulation.  Previous  studies reported  that de- 
creased  activation  of the amygdala  and increased  activation  of the dor- 
somedial  prefrontal  cortex (DMPFC),  anterior  cingulate  cortex (ACC) 
( McRae et al., 2010 ), dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC),  and infe- 
rior parietal  cortex ( Dörfel et al., 2014 ) were common  neural substrates  
for negative  emotion  regulation.  Greater  activation  of the left precen-  
tral gyrus, superior  parietal  lobule ( McRae et al., 2010 ), inferior  pari- 
etal cortex, and postcentral  gyrus ( Dörfel et al., 2014 ) was observed  in 
Attentional  Deployment  than in other strategies.  Reappraisal  (a Cogni- 
tive Change  strategy)  was linked to activation  in the regions  associated  
with processing  aﬀective  meaning,  such as the regions  in the ventro-  
lateral prefrontal  cortex (VLPFC),  medial prefrontal  cortex (MPFC),  and 
temporal  cortices  ( Dörfel et al., 2014 ; McRae et al., 2010 ). By contrast,  
Detachment  (a Cognitive  Change  strategy)  was related to greater acti- 
vation of the angular  gyrus. Furthermore,  Cognitive  Change  increased  
the activation  of the frontoparietal  network,  which is responsible  for 
the cognitive  control of emotion,  because  Cognitive  Change  requires  
cognitive  eﬀort ( Ochsner  et al., 2012 ). Dörfel et al. (2014) suggested  
that the Response  Modulation  strategy  recruited  regions  related to fa- 
cial emotion  recognition,  such as the supramarginal  gyrus, more than 
other strategies.  
As noted above, speciﬁc  brain regions  for each emotion  regula- 
tion strategy  have been investigated.  However,  caution  should be ex- 
ercised regarding  the speciﬁcity  of each strategy  because  regions  are 
part of complex  networks  and have multiple  functions  ( Bressler  and 
Menon,  2010 ; Riedel et al., 2018 ). Indeed,  previous  studies reported  
some networks  related to mainly negative  emotion  downregulation  
( Ochsner  et al., 2012 ; Morawetz  et al., 2020 ): two cortical  networks  as- 
sociated  with regulation  (a frontoparietal  network  and a left-lateralized  
prefrontal  network,  including  the VLPFC),  one subcortical  network  asso- 
ciated with emotion  perception  and generation  (e.g., bilateral  amygdala,  
bilateral  fusiform  gyrus, and VMPFC),  and one network  associated  with 
emotion  regulation  processes  and emotional  responses  (e.g., left supe- 
rior parietal  lobule, precuneus,  and posterior  cingulate  cortex).  Thus, 
the neural basis of negative  emotion  regulation,  including  associated  
brain regions  and networks,  has been thoroughly  investigated.

in pain perception  ( Chen and Rappelsberger,  1994 ; Giehl et al., 2014 ; 
Li et al., 2016 ; Nir et al., 2012 ; Peng et al., 2015 ). However,  others 
concluded  that there was no speciﬁc  EEG change associated  with pain 
(e.g., Chang et al., 2001 ; Huber et al., 2006 ; Ploner et al., 2017 for a 
review).  More recently,  the occurrence  of decreased  alpha as well as in- 
creased  gamma  power were reported  ( Peng et al., 2015 ; Schulz et al., 
2015 ). Importantly,  while some of these studies indicated  correlation  
between  the modulation  of the magnitude  in both alpha and gamma  
frequency  and pain perception,  other studies described  dissociation  be- 
tween them. For example,  Schulz et al. (2015) reported  no signiﬁcant  
relationship  between  pain intensity  and the magnitude  of brain oscilla- 
tions in the theta, alpha and beta range, but hinted to a pain-speciﬁc  role 
of prefrontal  gamma  oscillations  during tonic ongoing  pain. The same 
research  group later replicated  this pattern  ( Nickel et al., 2017 ). Never- 
theless,  they also revealed  an increased  connectivity  between  the sen- 
sorimotor  and prefrontal  region through  alpha frequency  during tonic 
pain (Nickel  at al., 2019). 
To date, the functional  role of brain oscillations  in prolonged  ex- 
perimental  pain is not fully established.  The systematic  assessment  of 
alpha oscillations,  and particularly  its frequency,  has fuelled pain neu- 
roscientists’  hope to discover  a mechanistic  role, similarly  to other re- 
search domains  ( Cecere et al., 2015 ; Cooke et al., 2019 ; Di Gregorio  
et al., 2022 ; Foxe and Snyder,  2011 ; Klimesch,  1999 ; Mierau et al., 2017 ; 
Migliorati  et al., 2019 ; Samaha  and Postle, 2015 ). 
The study of measures  of alpha frequency  has been recently  adopted  
in the context  of neurogenic  inﬂammatory  pain models (i.e., intrader-  
mal capsaicin)  in healthy  humans  ( Furman  et al., 2018 ). This approach  
allows induction  of hyperalgesia,  which is one of the main symptoms  
in chronic  pain conditions  ( Reichling  and Levine,  2009 ). Importantly,  
Furman  et al. (2018) found that individual  alpha frequency  (IAF) slowed 
with the increase  of pain sensitivity.  A ﬁnding  interpreted  as poten- 
tially relying on similar mechanisms  that may underpin  slowed alpha 
oscillations  observed  in clinical  pain patients  compared  to healthy  con- 
trols ( de Vries et al., 2013 ; Lim et al., 2016 ; Sarnthein  et al., 2006 ; 
Walton  et al., 2010 ). These studies lend support  to the idea that the slow- 
ing of IAF, particularly  in its lower range (8–9.5 Hz), may contribute  to 
the generation  of clinical  and chronic  pain. 
However,  there is also evidence  of increased  alpha frequency  dur- 
ing prolonged  (5 min) tonic thermal  pain in healthy  individuals,  and 
a positive  correlation  between  the increase  of alpha frequency  and the 
increase  of pain perception  ( Nir et al., 2010 ). In their most recent study 
Furman  et al. (2019) suggest  that the slowing  of IAF correlates  with pro- 
longed pain rather than repeated  consecutive  phasic painful stimulation.  
Crucially,  this correlational  ﬁnding  has been interpreted  as evidence  of 
IAF being a reliable  biomarker  of pain. 
We surmised  that the lack of control conditions  able to discriminate  
the oscillatory  activity  associated  with baseline  resting-state  alpha from 
unpleasant  and neutral  sensory  stimulation  could confound  the interpre-  
tation of the IAF functional  signiﬁcance.  More importantly,  there is no 
study attempting  to disentangle  whether  alpha brain oscillations  prefer- 
entially  reﬂect painful stimulation  rather than threatening  non-painful  
(but equally  unpleasant)  sensory  stimulation.  
Here, we devised  a methodology  apt to grant a ﬁne-grained  assess- 
ment of oscillatory  changes  speciﬁcally  locked to each diﬀerent  brain 
and perceptual  state. Considering  the previously  discussed  implication  
of alpha oscillations  during tonic pain, we addressed  whether  accelera-  
tion or deceleration  of alpha would distinguish  tonic pain compared  to 
several control conditions.  Furthermore,  we tested the strength  of the 
relationship  between  IAF and pain perception.  To attain our goal, we 
recorded  EEG on healthy  volunteers  during exposure  to consecutive  5 
min sessions  of painful hot water immersion,  innocuous  warm water 
immersion  and an aversive  prolonged  non-painful  auditory  stimulation.  
This aimed to dissect the speciﬁcity  of alpha frequency  for the prolonged  
hot water immersion.  To establish  a perceptual/experiential  compatibil-  
ity between  the two conditions,  we focused  our psychophysical  assess- 
ment on the unpleasantness  of their experience.  The rationale  being that unpleasantness  is the most distinctive  feature of pain ( Merskey  et al., 
1979 ; Price, 2000 ) while being strongly  correlated  with the intensity,  
salience,  and the homeostatic  threatening  value of the somatosensory  
stimulation  ( Borsook  et al., 2013 ; Price, 2000 ; Price et al., 2002 ). Par- 
ticipants  rated stimulus  unpleasantness  throughout  each condition.  We 
also asked participants  to sit still with eyes closed and eyes open right 
before and after the three experimental  conditions.  The latter were ex- 
pressed  as a function  of the baseline  closed and open eyes conditions  in 
separate  analyses.  
Based on previous  research,  we tested the conﬁrmatory  hypotheses  
that (1) individual  alpha power (IAP) is reduced  during prolonged  hot 
water compared  with warm immersion,  (2) IAF is slowed in prolonged  
hot water compared  with warm immersion,  (3) slowing  of IAF during 
hot water immersion  would predict increase  in unpleasantness  ratings 
within this condition.  We also tested the explorative  hypothesis  that (4) 
IAF is slowed during prolonged  hot water immersion  compared  with an 
equally  unpleasant  auditory  experience.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
A total of 43 participants  volunteered  to take part in the study which 
was approved  by the ethics committee  of the University  of Essex. Seven 
participants  were excluded.  One participant  disclosed  to have had taken 
a painkiller  prior to the experiment.  Another  participant  failed the per- 
ceptual  matching  procedure  (see below for detail).  Data from the 5 re- 
maining  participants  were excluded  due to technical  issues with EEG 
recording.  
This resulted  in a ﬁnal sample size of 36 participants  (22 females,  
mean age: 25.36, age range: 20–56).  Twenty-four  participants  self- 
identiﬁed  as White/Caucasian,  6 identiﬁed  as Asian/Paciﬁc  Islander,  
and 6 as Other. All participants  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  vi- 
sion and normal  hearing.  Prior to attending,  the recruited  volunteers  
were asked to complete  a questionnaire  to ensure that they had no his- 
tory of neurological,  psychiatric  or pain disorders  that could interfere  
with the study or jeopardise  their safety. 
2.2. Sensory  and pain stimulation  
We used immersion  in hot water to induce a tonic sensation  of ther- 
mal discomfort.  We asked the participants  to immerse  their left hand 
up to the wrist in a 30L tank (RW-3025P,  Medline  Scientiﬁc)  with con- 
stantly circulating  hot water, initially  set to 45°C. This speciﬁc  temper-  
ature has previously  been shown to induce a moderate  level of pain in 
healthy  subjects  (e.g., Granot et al., 2008 ). Importantly,  we instructed  
our participants  to focus on the unpleasantness  of their experience  as 
this would have been the dimension  by which they would have assessed  
the other experimental  conditions  too. 
To create a neutral  (non-painful)  control condition,  participants  im- 
mersed  their left hand up to the wrist in the same water tank, with the 
water temperature  set to be 6°C lower than the temperature  used for 
the hot condition.  This 6°C reduction  was selected  based on pilot ses- 
sions to deﬁne the optimal  temperature  reduction  to obtain a minimally  
unpleasant/no  unpleasant  water temperature.  We concluded  that a 6°C 
reduction  was the most eﬀective  quantity  in reducing  unpleasantness  
without  producing  a ﬂoor eﬀect on unpleasantness  in most of the pilot 
trials. 
Finally,  to create an unpleasant  auditory  stimulus  with a level of dis- 
comfort  comparable  to that of the hot water a constant  high-frequency  
tone (5000 Hz, Saw Tooth waveform)  was created  in Audacity  (v. 2.0.5) 
software  and played through  a pair of headphones  (NC-40,  Lindy; noise 
cancelling  was set to oﬀ). This condition  was devised  to control for the 
negative  aﬀect contribution  to the alpha oscillations.  While being not 
painful,  this condition  allowed  us to exclude  that the modulation  of al- 
pha activity  is not brought  about by non-pain-related  negative  aﬀective

crostructural  measures  such as volume,  thickness,  surface area, dif- 
fusivity  and fractional  anisotropy,  each of which convey comple-  
mentary  information  about the local morphology,  axonal density,  
organization  and myelination  of the cerebral  cortex ( Lerch et al., 
2017 ; Tardif et al., 2016 ). In healthy  aging, these techniques  have 
demonstrated  widespread  age-related  degeneration  of brain structure,  
namely  decreases  in overall brain volume  ( Hedman  et al., 2012 ), 
cortical  thickness  ( Fjell, McEvoy,  et al., 2014 ; Lowe et al., 2019 ; 
Shaw et al., 2016 ), and fractional  anisotropy  as well as increases  in 
diﬀusivity  ( Bartzokis,  2004 ; Lebel et al., 2012 ; Marner  et al., 2003 ; 
Tardif et al., 2016 ). They have also provided  evidence  for a brain- 
cognition  link in aging, for example  by previously  established  associ- 
ations between  episodic  memory  performance  with volumes  and dif- 
fusivity  of the medial temporal  lobe ( Philippi  et al., 2016 ; Raz & Ro- 
drigue, 2006 ; Reas et al., 2018 ; Schneider  et al., 2019 ), and between  
decline  in executive  functioning  and widespread  grey matter atrophy  
( Schneider  et al., 2019 ). 
However,  most studies to date have considered  these micro- and 
macro-structural  MRI metrics  individually,  without  considering  the 
complementary  information  multiple  metrics  provide  on brain structure,  
or their potential  overlap  and interdependencies.  Moreover,  most stud- 
ies have considered  a priori deﬁnitions  of cognitive  decline.  Previous  ap- 
proaches  investigating  brain-cognition  relationships  have deﬁned  sub- 
ject groupings  based on cognitive  trajectories  and then assessed  group 
diﬀerences  in brain structure  ( Persson  et al., 2006 ; Schneider  et al., 
2019 ). For example,  individuals  have been broadly  categorised  as cog- 
nitive “maintainers  ”, or “decliners  ”( Josefsson  et al., 2012 ). A com- 
mon strategy  is to categorize  the most severe decliners  and compare  
them to the rest of a cohort ( Schneider  et al., 2019 ). This approach  
involves  arbitrary  cut-oﬀs,  and may be biased by the extremes  of the 
decliner-maintenance  dimension,  neglecting  individuals  demonstrating  
neither  sharp decline  nor strong maintenance  ( Persson  et al., 2012 ). 
Furthermore,  broad categorisations  of maintainers/decliners  may also 
ignore intra-individual  heterogeneity  and the diﬀerential  impact of age 
across cognitive  domains  ( Goh et al., 2012 ; Park & Reuter-Lorenz,  2009 ; 
Rönnlund  et al., 2005 ). 
This study builds on previous  work in two important  ways. First, 
we integrate  multiple  MRI based indices of cortical  macro- and mi- 
crostructure.  Incorporating  data from multiple  MRI modalities  is use- 
ful as each conveys  complementary  information,  such that the resulting  
multimodal  assessments  query a wider range of biological  phenomena  
( Tardif et al., 2016 ). This approach  has enabled  ﬁne grained  assess- 
ments of the cerebral  cortex. Glasser  et al., for example,  incorporated  
data from structural  and functional  MRI to delineate  a novel parcel- 
lation of the cortex, including  the identiﬁcation  of de novo areas dis- 
tinguishable  as a result of this strategy  ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). Seidlitz  
et al. integrated  multimodal  MRI indices of cortical  structure  to identify  
morphometric  networks,  such that areas of the cortex displaying  mor- 
phometric  similarity  shared cytoarchitectonic  and transcriptional  fea- 
tures ( Seidlitz  et al., 2018 ). These ﬁndings  demonstrate  the speciﬁcity  
of associations  demonstrated  using multimodal  MRI. Modelling  shared 
covariance  across MRI metrics,  as opposed  to separately  analysing  each 
piece of information,  allows for a more comprehensive  assessment  of 
diﬀerences  across subjects  ( Groves et al., 2012 ). To this end, we ex- 
pand previous  work from our group on multi-modal  data-driven  par- 
cellation  of the hippocampus  using non-negative  matrix factorization  
(NMF),  and extend this methodology  to facilitate  integration  of multi- 
ple modalities  into a single analytical  framework  (R. Patel et al., 2020 ). 
In this study we consider  ﬁve MRI metrics.  From T1-weighted  struc- 
tural MRI we derive measurements  of cortical  thickness  (CT) and sur- 
face area (SA), which have been routinely  used to track age-related  
alterations  of brain structure  ( Dickerson  et al., 2009 ; Fjell, Westlye,  
et al., 2014 ; Frangou  et al., 2022 ; Habeck  et al., 2020 ; Lemaitre  et al., 
2012 ; Lerch et al., 2017 ; Querbes  et al., 2009 ; Raz & Rodrigue,  2006 ; 
Salat et al., 2004 ; Storsve  et al., 2014 ; Tamnes  et al., 2013 ). We also 
incorporated  diﬀusion  tensor imaging  (DTI) indices of mean and ra- dial diﬀusivity  (MD, RD) and fractional  anisotropy  (FA). While more 
commonly  associated  with the study of ﬁber structure  and organization  
in brain white matter ( Alexander  et al., 2007 ; Assaf, 2019 ), a number  
of recent studies have demonstrated  their sensitivity  to microstructural  
properties  of cortical  grey matter ( Aggarwal  et al., 2015 ; Assaf, 2019 ; 
Douaud  et al., 2013 ; Grydeland  et al., 2013 ; Kleinnijenhuis  et al., 
2015 ; Kochunov  et al., 2011 ; P. Lee et al., 2020 ; McKavanagh  et al., 
2019 ; Preziosa  et al., 2019 ; Scola et al., 2010 ; Seidlitz  et al., 2018 ; 
Torso, Bozzali,  et al., 2021 ; Torso, Ridgway,  et al., 2021 ; Truong  et al., 
2014 ). Though  their interpretation  in cortical  grey matter is com- 
plex and still under study, DTI indices have been shown to be sen- 
sitive to a range of neurobiological  features  ( Edwards  et al., 2018 ). 
Here we include  MD, FA, and RD as indices of degenerative  changes  
to axons (myelinated  and unmyelinated),  dendrites,  and cell bodies 
( Edwards  et al., 2018 ). FA and RD have previously  been shown to be cor- 
related with intracortical  myelin ( Geeraert  et al., 2018 ; Reveley  et al., 
2021 ; Seehaus  et al., 2015 ; Yuan et al., 2022) . The complementary  in- 
formation  from these metrics  increases  our sensitivity  to a vast range 
of age- and cognitive-related  cortical  alterations.  Further,  while in- 
terrelated  to some degree,  these measures  have each been shown to 
query unique aspects  of microstructure  ( Uddin et al., 2019 ), making  
them complementary  in nature. Thus, applied  to these ﬁve MRI met- 
rics, NMF highlights  regions  of the brain in which shared patterns  of 
variation  occur across a range of macro- and microstructural  features  
(D. D. Lee & Seung, 1999 ; R. Patel et al., 2020 ; Robert et al., 2022 ; 
Sotiras et al., 2015 ). 
Second,  we explore  individual  diﬀerences  in brain-cognition  rela- 
tionships  without  a priori designations  of cognitive  trajectories.  We 
instead  use a data-driven  approach  to probe the relationships  be- 
tween brain structure  and cognition.  We employ  partial least squares  
(PLS), a multivariate  technique  used to relate two sets of variables  
together  ( McIntosh  & Lobaugh,  2004 ), to identify  covarying  relation-  
ships between  brain structure  and cognitive  performance  in a data- 
driven fashion.  This approach  sidesteps  the need for a priori deﬁni- 
tions and enables  identiﬁcation  of dimensions  along which subject-  
speciﬁc  brain-cognition  relationships  exist, instead  of distinct  de- 
cline/maintenance  categorizations.  Importantly,  we then assess bi- 
ological  signiﬁcance  of the identiﬁed  patterns  by exploring  how 
individual  variation  in these dimensions  predicts  future cognitive  
performance.  
In this study we analyse  data from the Whitehall  II cohort, a unique 
and comprehensive  longitudinal  dataset which enables  study of the 
relationship  between  mid- and late-life  features.  This ongoing  study 
was established  in 1985 at University  College  London  and initially  in- 
cluded 10,308 British civil servants  ( Marmot  & Brunner,  2005 ). Lon- 
gitudinal  follow-up  occurred  at multiple  timepoints  (deﬁned  through-  
out as Waves).  We analyse  data collected  between  1997 and 2016, col- 
lected roughly  every ﬁve years at Wave 5 (1997-1999),  7 (2002-2004),  
9 (2007-2009),  11 (2012-2013),  and 12 (2015-2016).  At each Wave, 
information  on social, cognitive,  and biological  data was collected,  re- 
sulting in a unique source of information  to study aging. Eight hun- 
dred individuals  from Wave 11 were randomly  selected  to participate  
in the Whitehall  II Imaging  sub-study  (Imaging  Wave, 2012-16)  in which 
structural,  diﬀusion,  and functional  MRI was collected  ( Filippini  et al., 
2014 ). In this work, our goal is to probe sources  of individual  variability  
in the link between  cognitive  decline  and cortical  structure.  We do this 
by leveraging  the unique Whitehall  II Imaging  sub-study  dataset with 
multivariate  techniques  to identify  brain-cognition  modes of covari- 
ance between  multimodal  MRI measures  of late-life  brain structure  and 
cognitive  trajectories  from mid- to late-life.  We include  several struc- 
tural and diﬀusion  MRI measurements  to maximize  our sensitivity  to a 
range of age-associated  changes  in cortical  structure.  ( Edwards  et al., 
2018 ; Fjell, McEvoy,  et al., 2014 ; Lowe et al., 2019 ; Schneider  et al., 
2019 ). We then examine  the biological  signiﬁcance  of the brain- 
cognition  relationships  by testing their association  with future cognitive  
performance.

Figure 1. Identifying  structural-cognition  relationships  in aging using data-driven  techniques.  A) We analysed  data from the Whitehall  II Imaging  Sub-Study.  
Participants  were tested across multiple  cognitive  domains  at ∼5-year intervals  since 1997, with structural  and diﬀusion  MRI collected  between  Waves 11 and 12. B) 
We applied non-negative  matrix factorization  (NMF) to ﬁve metrics of cortical morphology:  cortical thickness  (CT), surface area (SA), fractional  anisotropy  (FA), and 
mean and radial diﬀusivity  (MD, RD) to identify patterns  of variance.  Using cognitive  data from Wave 5-11, we applied mixed eﬀects modelling  to identify intercept  
and slope measurements  for each individual  across a range of cognitive  tests during the 20-year period. We then used a partial least squares (PLS) analysis  to identify 
brain-cognition  latent variables  describing  covariance  between  longitudinal  cognitive  trajectories  and late life cortical morphology.  C) We related expression  of the 
brain-cognition  latent variables  to future cognition  to show the identiﬁed  brain-cognition  latent variables  predict future performance  in two distinct ways. 
2. Methods  
Using the comprehensive  lifespan  data from the Whitehall  II Imag- 
ing sub-study  ( Figure 1 A), we analyse  longitudinal  cognitive  trajecto-  
ries across multiple  domains  and assess their relationship  with late-life  
cortical  structure  using surface area (SA), cortical  thickness  (CT), mean 
diﬀusivity  (MD), fractional  anisotropy  (FA) and radial diﬀusivity  (RD). 
Across multiple  structural  MRI indices,  we model shared covariance  us- 
ing NMF. We use linear mixed eﬀects modeling  to extract subject spe- 
ciﬁc indices of baseline  performance  and change in performance  across 
multiple  cognitive  tests during a period of 20 years. We then use par- 
tial least squares  (PLS) to identify  distinct  patterns  of covariance  be- 
tween structure  and longitudinal  cognitive  performance,  which we term 
brain-cognition  latent variables  ( Figure 1 B) ( McIntosh  & Lobaugh,  2004 ; 
McIntosh  & Mi š i ć, 2013 ). Finally,  we use each individual’s  expression  of 
the identiﬁed  latent variables  to predict cognitive  function  at a follow- 
up timepoint,  approximately",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5375, 5378), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(12226, 12230), match='  3.'>"

best-predicting  feature space corresponds  to the best hypothesis  about 
the information  encoded  in this voxel. However,  it is important  not to 
view feature-space  comparison  as a winner-take-all  situation.  It is pos- 
sible (and in fact common)  to ﬁnd that a brain area represents  multiple  
feature spaces simultaneously.  To take this possibility  into account,  a 
joint regression  is ﬁt on multiple  feature spaces. The joint regression  
automatically  combines  the information  from all feature spaces to max- 
imize the joint prediction  accuracy.  Then, a variance  decomposition  
method  (e.g. variance  partitioning  Çukur et al., 2016; de Heer et al., 
2017; LeBel et al., 2021; Lescroart  and Gallant,  2019; Lescroart  et al., 
2015 ) is used to decompose  the variance  explained  by the joint model 
into separate  contributions  from each feature space. However,  variance  
partitioning  is limited in practice  to small numbers  of feature spaces 𝑚 
(e.g. 2 or 3), because  it decomposes  the variance  into 2 𝑚 − 1 values that 
are hard to interpret.  There is a need for a method  to decompose  the 
variance  over larger numbers  of feature spaces. 
The regression  model trained  to predict brain activity  from a feature 
space is usually  regularized  in order to improve  generalization.  The most 
common  regularized  regression  model is ridge regression  (see more de- 
tails in Section  2.2 ). However,  ridge regression  is not suited to ﬁt joint 
models on multiple  feature spaces, because  it uses the same regulariza-  
tion hyperparameter  for all feature spaces. In practice,  it is rare for all 
feature spaces to require  the same level of regularization,  because  the 
optimal  level of regularization  depends  on factors such as the number  of 
features,  the feature covariances,  and the predictive  power of the feature 
space. To address  this challenge,  ridge regression  is naturally  extended  
to use a separate  regularization  level per feature space. This extension  
is called banded ridge regression  ( Nunez-Elizalde  et al., 2019 ). By learn- 
ing a separate  regularization  hyperparameter  for every feature space, 
banded  ridge regression  can optimize  regularization  strength  separately  
for each feature space. As a side eﬀect, learning  separate  hyperparame-  
ters leads to a feature-space  selection  mechanism  that was not described  
in the original  paper ( Nunez-Elizalde  et al., 2019 ). There is a need for a 
proper description  of this mechanism.  
Another  challenge  with banded  ridge regression  is its computational  
cost. Because  this method  requires  the optimization  of a separate  hyper- 
parameter  for every feature space, the optimization  algorithm  is neces- 
sarily more complicated  than that used for simple ridge regression.  For 
example,  using a grid search (as is common  in ridge regression)  is im- 
practical  in banded  ridge regression  with more than three or four fea- 
ture spaces because  its computational  cost scales exponentially  with the 
number  of feature spaces. This computational  challenge  is particularly  
diﬃcult  when modeling  hundreds  of thousands  of voxels independently.  
There is a need for an algorithm  to eﬃciently  ﬁt models with banded  
ridge regression.  
Overview  of the paper This work expands  on earlier banded  ridge re- 
gression  work from our laboratory  ( Nunez-Elizalde  et al., 2019 ) in three 
ways, described  respectively  in the three sections.  
Section  2 ﬁrst provides  a brief overview  of the encoding  model 
framework.  Then, it proposes  an alternative  method  to variance  par- 
titioning,  to decompose  variance  over large numbers  of feature spaces. 
The proposed  method  is based on the product  measure  ( Hoﬀman,  1960; 
Pratt, 1987 ), whose computational  cost scales linearly  with the number  
of feature spaces. This variance  decomposition  can be applied  to any 
linear regression  ﬁtting method,  including  ridge regression  and banded  
ridge regression.  
Section  3 reviews  banded  ridge regression,  and describes  how it per- 
forms a feature-space  selection  by discarding  non-predictive  or redun- 
dant feature spaces. This feature-space  selection  mechanism  explains  
how banded  ridge regression  is able to eﬀectively  disentangle  correlated  
feature spaces ( Nunez-Elizalde  et al., 2019 ). Then, it discusses  the rela- 
tionship  between  banded  ridge regression  and other regression  methods  
with a similar feature-space  selection  mechanism,  such as automatic  rel- 
evance determination,  multiple-kernel  learning,  and the group lasso. 
Section  4 addresses  the practical  challenge  of solving  banded  ridge 
regressions  with many feature spaces on large numbers  of voxels. Two methods  are proposed  to eﬃciently  solve banded  ridge regression.  The 
ﬁrst uses hyperparameter  random  search over a Dirichlet  distribution,  
while the second uses hyperparameter  gradient  descent  with implicit  
diﬀerentiation.  Both methods  provide  speed improvements  of several 
orders of magnitude  compared  to the Bayesian  search proposed  ear- 
lier ( Nunez-Elizalde  et al., 2019 ). Finally,  all implementations  are made 
available  in an open-source  Python package  called Himalaya  , 1 with both 
CPU and GPU support,  rigorous  unit-testing,  and extensive  documenta-  
tion. 
This paper focuses  on fMRI datasets  and the associated  terminol-  
ogy. However,  the methods  presented  here can also be applied  to 
data acquired  using other neuroimaging  modalities,  and more gener- 
ally to any similarly  structured  regression  setting.  The methods  could 
even be used to integrate  across multiple  neuroimaging  modalities  
Rasero et al. (2021) . 
2. Variance  decomposition  over feature  spaces 
This section starts with a brief overview  of the encoding  model 
framework,  introducing  key concepts  such as linear regression,  ridge 
regression,  explained  variance,  and feature-space  comparison  (see also 
Fig. 1 ). Then, it explains  the beneﬁt of ﬁtting joint models over multiple  
feature spaces, and discusses  how to decompose  the explained  variance  
over feature spaces by adapting  the product  measure  ( Hoﬀman,  1960; 
Pratt, 1987 ). 
2.1. Linear regression  
The regression  method  used in encoding  models is often linear in 
the parameters.  Using linear regression  has several beneﬁts  compared  
to non-linear  regression.  The main beneﬁt is to only focus on explicit rep- 
resentations  ( Ivanova  et al., 2021; Kamitani  and Tong, 2005; Kriegesko-  
rte and Kievit, 2013; Naselaris  et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006; King et al., 
2018 ). With non-linear  regression,  some features  might be able to pre- 
dict brain activity  even though they do not explicitly  encode the same 
information  as the brain region (e.g. pixel features  do not explicitly  en- 
code the semantic  content  of an image, even though semantic  content  
can be extracted  from the pixels).  Restricting  the regression  method  to 
be linear is thus a way to only consider  features  that explicitly  represent  
brain activity.  Additionally,  linearity  enables  the use of various  meth- 
ods to interpret  the regression  model, such as variance  partitioning  or 
feature importance  methods  (see Section  2.5 ). Finally,  linear regression  
methods  are computationally  eﬃcient  and robust to small sample sizes 
that are common  in neuroimaging  studies.  Note that encoding  models 
that use linear regression  are sometimes  called linearized  encoding  mod- 
els ( Naselaris  et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006 ), to emphasize  that feature 
extraction  can be non-linear.  
Mathematically,  let us note 𝑋 ∈ℝ 𝑛 ×𝑝 the matrix of features,  with 𝑛 
samples  and 𝑝 features,  and 𝑦 ∈ℝ 𝑛 the brain activity  vector (or target 
vector).  Linear regression  seeks a weight vector 𝑏 ∈ℝ 𝑝 such that the 
target vector is approximated  as a linear combination  of the features  
𝑦 ≈𝑋𝑏 . It is standard  to model the error as additive  Gaussian  white 
noise, so that 𝑦 = 𝑋𝑏 + 𝜀 , with a noise vector 𝜀 ∈ℝ 𝑛 drawn from a cen- 
tered Gaussian  distribution.  (The Gaussian  assumption  is reasonable  for 
de-trended  fMRI recordings,  but might not be valid for single-trial  neu- 
rophysiology).  This regression  method  is called ordinary  least squares , 
and can be written  as an optimization  problem  
𝑏 ∗ = argmin 
𝑏 ||𝑦 − 𝑋𝑏 ||2 
2 , (1) 
where ||𝑎 ||2 
2 = ∑
𝑖 𝑎 2 
𝑖 is the squared  𝐿 2 norm. 
The main limitation  of ordinary  least squares  is that it is unstable  
in some situations.  To understand  this issue, note that solving  ordinary  
least squares  amounts  to inverting  the eigenvalues  𝜎𝑖 of the matrix 𝑋 ⊤𝑋.

Fig. 1. Overview  of the encoding  model framework.  (a) The encoding  model framework  uses a regression  model to predict a brain activity 𝑦 ∈ℝ 𝑛 with features  
𝑋 ∈ℝ 𝑛 ×𝑝 extracted  from the stimulus  (or task). The regression  model is usually linear (see Section 2.1 ), 𝑦 ≈𝑋𝑏 , with a weight vector 𝑏 ∈ℝ 𝑝 . Regularization  can be 
also used to improve  the regression  model (see Section 2.2 ). (b) A cornerstone  of the encoding  model framework  is the separation  of the data into a train set and 
a test set. The regression  model is ﬁt on the train set only. Then, the ﬁt model is used to predict brain activity on the test set. Finally, the prediction  accuracy  is 
evaluated  on the test set by comparing  the prediction  vector with the recorded  brain activity.  The prediction  accuracy  is quantiﬁed  for instance  with the 𝑅 2 score, 
which can be interpreted  as the explained  variance  (see Section 2.3 ). (c) When multiple  feature spaces are available,  a separate  model can be ﬁt on each feature 
space, to compare  the prediction  accuracy  of each model (see Section 2.4 ). However,  considering  only the best-predicting  feature space ignores the possibility  that 
feature spaces can be complementary.  (d) To take into account complementarity  between  feature spaces, a joint regression  can be ﬁt on multiple  feature spaces 
simultaneously.  The feature spaces are concatenated  into a large feature matrix 𝑋, and a single weight vector 𝑏 is learned.  (e) Then, the prediction  vector 𝑦 can be 
decomposed  into a sum of partial predictions  from each feature space 𝑦 𝑖 = 𝑋 𝑖 𝑏 𝑖 . Finally, the explained  variance  𝑅 2 can be decomposed  into the contribution  of each 
feature space (see Section 2.5 ), for instance  using the product measure  (see Section 2.6 ) or variance  partitioning  (see Section 2.7 ). 
When features  are correlated,  some eigenvalues  can be small, which re- 
duces the stability  of the inversion  (a small change in the features  can 
have a large eﬀect on the result). In some cases, some eigenvalues  can 
even be equal to zero, which makes the inversion  ill-deﬁned.  Eigenval-  
ues equal to zero can arise when some features  are fully redundant  (e.g. 
one feature being the sum of two other features),  or when the number  of 
independent  features  is greater than the number  of samples  ( 𝑝 > 𝑛 ). The 
system is then called underdetermined,  and the optimization  problem  
has inﬁnitely  many solutions,  of which most do not generalize  well to 
new data. To solve these issues, ordinary  least squares  can be extended  
into ridge regression  ( Hoerl and Kennard,  1970 ). 
2.2. Ridge regression  
Ridge regression  ( Hoerl and Kennard,  1970 ) is a generalization  of 
ordinary  least squares  which adds a regularization  term to the optimiza-  
tion problem.  The optimization  problem  becomes  
𝑏 ∗ = argmin 
𝑏 ||𝑦 − 𝑋𝑏 ||2 
2 + 𝜆||𝑏 ||2 
2 , (2) 
where 𝜆> 0 is a hyperparameter  controlling  the regularization  strength.  
This regularization  improves  the robustness  of the model by adding 
a positive  value 𝜆to all eigenvalues  𝜎𝑖 ≥ 0 of 𝑋 ⊤𝑋before the matrix 
inversion.  Inverting  𝜎𝑖 + 𝜆instead  of 𝜎𝑖 reduces  the instability  caused 
by small eigenvalues,  and allows inverting  underdetermined  systems  
(where 𝜎𝑖 = 0 ). Small eigenvalues  and underdetermined  systems  are 
common  when using large numbers  of features.  Because  naturalistic  
stimuli often involve  large numbers  of highly correlated  features,  this 
regularization  scheme  facilitates  the analysis  of naturalistic  experiments  
and so increases  ecological  validity  ( Huth et al., 2016; Sonkusare  et al., 
2019; Wu et al., 2006 ). 
In ridge regression,  the regularization  hyperparameter  𝜆must be es- 
timated  from the data. If the estimated  value is too low then the model 
will tend to overﬁt to noise in the data, and if it is too high then the 
model will not predict as well as it might. The regularization  param- eter is typically  selected  through  a grid search with cross-validation  
(Hastie  et al., 2009, Ch. 7) . First, a set of hyperparameter  candidates  𝜆
is deﬁned,  typically  over a grid of logarithmically  spaced values to span 
multiple  orders of magnitude.  Then, the data set is split into a training  
set ( 𝑋 train , 𝑦 train ) and a validation  set ( 𝑋 val , 𝑦 val ). The regression  model 
is ﬁt on the training  set, and its prediction  accuracy  is evaluated  on the 
validation  set. This process  is performed  for all hyperparameter  candi- 
dates, and the candidate  leading  to the highest  prediction  accuracy  is 
selected.  To improve  the robustness  of the hyperparameter  selection,  
the prediction  accuracy  is usually  averaged  over multiple  splits of the 
data into a training  and a validation  set. Finally,  a ridge regression  is ﬁt 
on the full data set using the selected  hyperparameter.  
Ridge regression  is the most popular  regression  method  in voxelwise  
encoding  models.  Other popular  linear regression  methods  include  the 
lasso ( Tibshirani,  1996 ) or linear support-vector  machines  ( Cortes and 
Vapnik,  1995 ). However,  both methods  have a much larger compu-  
tational  cost than ridge regression.  In particular,  their computational  
cost increases  linearly  with the number  of voxels. Because  a typical 
fMRI dataset contains  about 10 5 voxels, ﬁtting an independent  regres- 
sion model on each voxel is computationally  challenging.  In the case 
of ridge regression,  the computational  bottleneck  (inverting  the linear 
system)  can be shared for all voxels (see Section  4.1 for more details).  
This is not the case in the lasso or in support-vector  machines.  For these 
reasons,  solving  ridge regression  on large numbers  of voxels is fast com- 
pared to solving  the lasso or linear support-vector  machines.

of prosocial  behavior  as well as a means to concomitantly  reduce own 
stress. 
From the perspective  of mental training  and therapeutic  interven-  
tions, there is a need to deﬁne MBIs’ active mechanisms  in order 
to establish  functional  targets,  i.e., speciﬁc  psychological  constructs,  
to further generalize  and adapt their applicability  to speciﬁc  popula-  
tions ( Katz et al., 2018 ; Schnell  and Herpertz,  2018 ). Evidence  has 
suggested  that diverse  cognitive,  perceptual  and emotional  processes  
could play a signiﬁcant  role in mindfulness  related salutary  eﬀects 
( Guendelman  et al., 2017 ; Lutz et al., 2015 ). The present  study focuses  
on ER processes  exclusively.  Identifying  respective  putative  brain corre- 
lates of these ER mechanisms  can assist in the endeavor  of identifying  
relevant  mechanisms  ( Zilverstand  et al., 2017 ; Morawetz  et al., 2017 ). 
Study results on speciﬁc  ER strategies,  however,  have been heteroge-  
neous. Some recent studies have shown that MBIs enhance  ER through  
cognitive  reappraisal  , i.e., the capacity  to change the cognitive  frame of a 
stressful  stimuli ( Garland  et al., 2011 , 2015 , 2017 ; Goldin et al., 2016 ), 
although  reappraisal  is not explicitly  taught in the context  of MBIs. Oth- 
ers have provided  evidence  that acceptance  , i.e., the capacity  to tol- 
erate the experience  of emotional  stress without  reacting  on it, is the 
main targeted  ER mechanism  ( Lindsay  and Creswell,  2017 ; Lindsay  and 
Young, 2018 ; Lindsay  and Creswell,  2019 ; Britton et al., 2017 ). 
Furthermore,  despite some evidence  suggesting  that MBIs (includ-  
ing those speciﬁcally  focusing  on compassion)  overall increase  empathy  
and prosociality  ( Luberto  et al., 2018 ; Kirby et al., 2017 ; Kreplin  et al., 
2018 ; Hildebrandt  et al., 2017 ; Trautwein  et al., 2020 ; Mascaro  et al., 
2013 ; Weng et al., 2013 ; Condon  et al., 2013 ; Lutz et al., 2009 ; Lim et al., 
2015 ), there seems to be little evidence  for such an eﬀect speciﬁcally  for 
MBSR ( Lamothe  et al., 2018 ; Lamothe  et al., 2016 ; van Dijk et al., 2017 ). 
Previous  longitudinal  functional  brain studies have shown across diﬀer- 
ent emotion-processing  tasks that MBIs increase  activation  in areas like 
the prefrontal  and cingulate  cortex, anterior  insula and hippocampus  
( Guendelman  et al., 2017 ; Young et al., 2017 ; Gotink et al., 2016 )- re- 
gions that have been linked to self ER ( Morawetz  et al., 2017 ; Kohn et al., 
2014 ). Interestingly,  other studies have highlighted  activation  gains 
in parietal  cortex regions  (i.e. including  precuneus)  ( Trautwein  et al., 
2020 ; Mascaro  et al., 2013 ), a node that appears  to be sensitive  to other 
ER ( Hallam  et al., 2014 ; Reeck et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless,  no brain imag- 
ing study to date has integrated  both cognitive  reappraisal  and accep- 
tance as ER strategies,  or its generalization  to stressful  social interactions  
in one study design. While neuroimaging  studies can help elucidating  
active and eﬃcacious  mechanisms  of MBIs, randomized  controlled  tri- 
als (RCT) linking the amount  of meditation  practice  and brain changes  
have shown mixed results ( Kral et al., 2018 ; Kral et al., 2019 ). In ad- 
dition, it is still unclear  whether  neuroplasticity  eﬀects and subjective  
stress reduction  are indeed related.  Both possible  dose-eﬀect  responses  
and brain-behavioral  linkage  would serve as important  evidence  for the 
usefulness  of brain read-outs  as endpoints  in MBIs. Finally,  regarding  
further application  of MBIs in the context  of precision  medicine,  it re- 
mains unclear  if brain activation  pre- intervention  can assist in the pre- 
diction of individuals’  treatment  outcomes.  Thus, in the current  study 
we sought to address  those questions  with an RCT including  pre/post  
intervention  functional  neuroimaging  focusing  on the eﬀects on stress 
reduction  through  emotion  regulation  in social and non-social  contexts.  
Although  the immediate  stress-reducing  eﬀects of MBIs are well doc- 
umented  and subjective  questionnaire  reports support  that stress reduc- 
tion generalizes  into everyday  life, studies inducing  social stress via so- 
cial evaluation  are much less numerous.  Those few existing  studies point 
in the same direction  ( Creswell  et al., 2014 ; Rosenkranz  et al., 2013 ). 
However,  evidence  is lacking  regarding  the mechanisms  by which MBIs 
inﬂuence  own distress  levels while actively  interacting  with and regu- 
lating others. In the current  study, using a novel interactive  task, we 
sought to ascertain  whether  MBIs can i) increase  the capacity  of reduc- 
ing own stress in the context  of facing aversive  pictures  alone or while 
regulating  another  person,  and ii) induce functional  brain changes  in 
emotion  regulatory  networks.  Given ample previous  research  on MBSR and self ER 
( Guendelman  et al., 2017 ; Chiesa et al., 2013 ), we hypothesized  
from a behavioral  perspective  that MBSR, compared  to an active con- 
trol intervention  (a reading/sharing  group, READ),  would: (i) increase  
the capacity  for reducing  own stress when using cognitive  reappraisal,  
in the context  of self ER ( Garland  et al., 2011 , 2017 ; Goldin et al., 
2016 ); (ii) also increase  the capacity  for reducing  own stress when 
using acceptance,  in the context  of self ER ( Lindsay  and Young, 2018 ; 
Lindsay  and Creswell,  2019 ). Even more, and given previous  studies 
on the neuronal  correlates  of acceptance  ( Goldin et al., 2019 ) and 
cognitive  reappraisal  ( Buhle et al., 2014 ), we hypothesized  from a 
brain perspective  that MBSR, compared  to the READ group, would: 
(iii) lead to higher brain activation  in prefrontal  (dorso-medial  and 
dorso-lateral)  and parietal  areas when using cognitive  reappraisal,  in 
the context  of self ER ( Goldin et al., 2013 ); (iv) lead to higher brain 
activation  in parietal  and insular areas when using acceptance,  in the 
context  of self ER ( Goldin et al., 2013 ; Farb et al., 2010 ). 
To ascertain  if MBSR eﬀects on reducing  own stress extend to so- 
cial contexts,  we furthermore  investigated  its eﬀects on personal  distress  
while regulating  another  person’s  emotions.  Much less research  has been 
performed  on other ER and none in a longitudinal  fashion,  however,  that 
would allow us to base our hypotheses  on. Given the scarce available  ev- 
idence,  we expect from a behavioral  perspective  that MBSR, compared  
to the READ group, would: (i) also increase  the capacity  for reducing  
own stress when using cognitive  reappraisal,  in the context  of other ER 
( Creswell  et al., 2014 ; Rosenkranz  et al., 2013 ); (ii) increase  the capacity  
for reducing  own stress when using acceptance,  in the context  of other 
ER ( Creswell  et al., 2014 ; Rosenkranz  et al., 2013 ). Furthermore,  and 
given previous  brain studies on social ER ( Reeck et al., 2016 ) but also 
on neuronal  correlates  of acceptance  ( Goldin et al., 2019 ) and cognitive  
reappraisal  ( Buhle et al., 2014 ), we hypothesize  from a brain perspec-  
tive that MBSR, compared  to the READ group, would: (iii) lead to higher 
brain activation  in pre-frontal  and parietal  (precuenus  and TPJ) areas 
when using cognitive  reappraisal,  in the context  other ER ( Hallam  et al., 
2014 ; Reeck et al., 2016 ); (iv) lead to higher brain activation  in insu- 
lar and parietal  (precuenus  and TPJ) areas when using acceptance,  in 
the context  of other ER ( Goldin et al., 2019 ; Farb et al., 2010 ). These 
corresponded  to our primary  outcome  measures.  
Finally,  in an eﬀort to elucidate  distant generalization  eﬀects of 
MBSR on socio-emotional  functioning,  we investigated  the eﬀects of 
the intervention  on cognitive  and emotional  empathy  using an exter- 
nal task. We hypothesized  that the MBSR compared  to the READ group 
would increase  cognitive  and emotional  empathy.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Healthy  subjects  were recruited  from the general  population  in the 
city of Berlin, Germany.  Of 550 subjects  assessed  for eligibility,  484 were 
excluded  (293 did not meet inclusion  criteria,  189 declined  to partici-  
pate upon getting full study information).  The remaining  68 were ran- 
domly assigned  to either experimental  (MBSR,  n = 34) or control group 
(READ,  n = 34; Fig. 1 CONSORT  ﬂow). Groups  did not diﬀer in gender,  
age or education  ( Table 1 ). FMRI assessments  were acquired  at base- 
line (T1; MSBR (n = 30), READ (n = 29)) and post intervention  (T2; MSBR 
(n = 29), READ (n = 26)). 
2.2. Procedure  
The study was advertised  as a trial comparing  the eﬀects of two men- 
tal health interventions,  through  diﬀerent  procedures  (e.g. posters,  ﬂy- 
ers, emails, etc.). Recruitment  included  online and in-person  screening,  
exclusion  criteria  were history of neurological  or psychiatric  disorders,  
non controlled  medical  condition,  current  use of psychoactive  drugs, 
non-ﬂuent  German  level, previous  experience  with meditation  or yoga.

Inclusion  criteria  included:  commitment  and capacity  for performing  
daily homework  (30–45 min) assignments  during 8 weeks, normal  or 
corrected-to-normal  vision and absence  of any contra-indication  crite- 
ria for performing  an fMRI experiment  (list of inclusion/exclusion  cri- 
teria in supplementary  materials  (1). From subjects  who were eligible  
to participate  in the study, most of them declined  because  of the inten- 
sive workload  required  by the interventions  (i.e., one hour homework  
per day). Subjects  received  the interventions  free of cost, and received  
a monetary  reimbursement  for study participation.  People initially  al- 
located  to the READ group were oﬀered to receive  MBSR after the last 
assessment.  Subjects  were randomly  assigned  using a stratiﬁed  proce- 
dure (with an in-house  Excel script), ﬁrst allocating  equal number  of 
male subjects  to each group, in order to secure gender proportion  in 
both arms of the trial. A higher rate of female participants  is a well- 
known selection  bias in MBI trials ( Macinko  and Upchurch,  2019 ).

ogy (within  the prior six months)  relative  to adversity  experienced  in 
the past year (i.e., number  of adverse  events over which the participant  
had little or no control,  cf. Amstadter  et al., 2014 ; Bowes et al., 2010 ; 
Collishaw  et al., 2016 ; Rutter, 2013 ). 
Our investigation  was inspired  by theories  of early life adversity  
which posit that mechanisms  underlying  initial positive  adjustment  
to environmental  challenges  may contribute  to the long-term  seque- 
lae of stress exposure  ( Belsky, 2019 ; McLaughlin  et al., 2014, 2016 ). 
We thus sought to elucidate  whether  the neural substrates  of short- 
term resilience  overlap  those reportedly  underpinning  the long-term  
negative  consequences  of adversity  and whether  any observed  relation-  
ships would vary by life stage (i.e., adolescence  versus middle adult- 
hood) ( Colich et al., 2020 ; Ramirez  et al., 2020 ; Rasmussen  et al., 2019 ; 
Tooley et al., 2021 ). Our focus was on accelerated  brain and biologi-  
cal aging, two well-documented  sequelae  of early life adversity  predic- 
tive of later psychological  vulnerability  due to increased  allostatic  load 
and poorer ﬁne tuning of the slower developing  association  systems  
transdiagnostically  involved  in psychopathology  ( Colich et al., 2020 ; 
McLaughlin  et al., 2020 ; McTeague  et al., 2017 ; Tooley et al., 2021 ). In 
childhood  and adolescence,  the two sequelae  are likely interdependent,  
as pubertal  hormones  regulate  brain maturation  processes,  while preco- 
cious functional  neurodevelopment  protects  against  accelerated  cellular  
aging following  stress exposure  ( Eck and Bangasser,  2020 ; Laube et al., 
2020 ; Miller et al., 2020 ; Piekarski  et al., 2017 ). Importantly,  acceler-  
ated neurobiological  aging in childhood  and adolescence  is regarded  
as an immediately  adaptive  response  to adverse  rearing  environments  
( Belsky, 2019 ; Rickard  et al., 2014 ). Speciﬁcally,  precocious  brain de- 
velopment,  particularly  for circuits  relevant  to emotion  regulation,  fos- 
ters successful  coping,  whereas  earlier biological  maturation  (i.e., ear- 
lier pubertal  timing)  is posited  to be evolutionarily  adaptive  because  
it maximises  reproductive  opportunities  before an anticipated  prema- 
ture demise ( Belsky, 2019 ; Brieant  et al., 2021 ; Callaghan  and Totten-  
ham, 2016 ; Gee et al., 2013 ). 
To our knowledge,  a link between  accelerated  neurobiological  aging 
and psychological  resilience  in middle adulthood  has not been formally  
articulated.  Such an association  is nonetheless  plausible  with regards  
to brain aging, if quicker  recovery  and/or greater active resistance  to 
stressors  in later life stem(s)  partly from reduced  reactivity  and less 
diﬀerentiated  processing  of the external  environment,  both of which 
are putative  key features  of neural senescence  ( Garrett  et al., 2013 , 
2020 ; Grady and Garrett,  2018 ). In contrast,  a positive  link between  re- 
silience  and accelerated  biological  aging, at least in the form of earlier 
menopausal  onset, seems unlikely,  given the role of ovarian  hormones  
in dampening  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA) axis activity  fol- 
lowing stress exposure  ( Engel et al., 2019 ; Joﬀe et al., 2020 ; Süss et al., 
2021 ). Thus, if a relationship  between  biological  aging and patterns  of 
brain aging associated  with resilience  were to emerge,  it would likely 
be negative.  
Capitalizing  on the above reviewed  literature,  the present  study 
tested the model represented  in Fig. 1 . In short, adverse  life experi- 
ences were expected  to accelerate  brain development/aging,  both di- 
rectly ( Fig. 1 , a-c), and via speeded  biological  maturation  ( Fig. 1 , a-b-c) 
( Belsky, 2019 ; Colich et al., 2020 ). Our goal was to identify  patterns  
of accelerated  brain development/aging  linked to resilience  ( Fig. 1 , c- 
d) and probe their relevance  to long-term  psychological  vulnerability,  
speciﬁcally,  risk for pathologies  characterised  by premature  brain senes- 
cence ( Fig. 1 , c-e). We reasoned  that earlier timing of brain develop-  
ment/aging  processes  associated  with short-term  resilience  in adoles- 
cence and middle adulthood  could still reﬂect increased  neurobiological  
“wear and tear ” and, thus, be linked to cellular  markers  suggestive  of 
long-term  risk for accelerated  brain aging pathologies.  
Because  history of exposure  to stressors  can impact short-term  re- 
silience  ( Kalisch  et al., 2019 ), we sought to control for it through  
markers  of key risk dimensions,  such as deprivation  (i.e., absence  
of expected  environmental  support  [e.g., material,  cognitive]),  threat 
(i.e., actual or potential  exposure  to violence),  and unpredictability  ( Colich et al., 2020 ; Ellis et al., 2022 ; McLaughlin  et al., 2021 ). 
These dimensions  overlapped  the life domains  assessed  with the re- 
cent adverse  events scales, speciﬁcally,  ﬁnancial  diﬃculties,  exposure  
to crime/physical  violence,  conﬂict,  as well as unpredictable  events in- 
volving  interpersonal  loss (e.g., [parental]  separation/divorce)  or other 
signiﬁcant  life changes  (e.g., change of residence/school).  
Our approach  to controlling  for prior stress exposure  was grounded  
in evidence  that dimensional  operationalizations  of adversity  better 
capture  long-term  individual  variability  in neurodevelopmental  out- 
comes relative  to cumulative  risk measures,  which are further prone 
to recall biases, particularly  for adult samples  ( Baldwin  et al., 2019 ; 
Ellis et al., 2022 ; McLaughlin  et al., 2021 ). Thus, the following  in- 
dicators  were used to estimate  prior adversity  exposure.  First, global 
exposure  to multiple  dimensions  of adversity  was gauged  through  
measures  of socioeconomic  status (SES) ( Colich et al., 2020 ). Specif- 
ically, we used indices of income-to-needs,  race and educational  at- 
tainment,  which reportedly  encapsulate  distinguishable  experiential  as- 
pects relevant  to deprivation  (e.g., poverty  [deprivation  of vital mate- 
rial resources],  reduced  cognitive  stimulation  [cognitive  deprivation]),  
threat (e.g., discrimination)  and unpredictability  (e.g., job insecurity)  
( Braveman  et al., 2005 ; Colich et al., 2020 ; Machlin  et al., 2019). Al- 
though individual-  and/or family-focused,  these measures  (e.g., edu- 
cational  attainment)  have been shown to be strongly  correlated  ( r > 
0.50) with higher level environmental  SES indicators,  such as neigh- 
bourhood  disadvantage  ( Murtha  et al., 2022 ), which were unavail-  
able in the Lifespan  HCP dataset.  Second,  social environmental  unpre- 
dictability  was estimated  through  indices of marital  relationship  disso- 
lution/reconﬁguration  ([parental]  divorce/spousal  death and the exis- 
tence of step-parents,  cf. Ellis et al., 2022 ), critical stressors  across the 
lifespan  ( Kendler  et al., 2017 ; Oh et al., 2018 ; Richards  et al., 1997 ). 
Third, in the HCP-Development  sample only, we further controlled  for 
family conﬂict,  a social threat-based  stressor  evaluated  through  both 
youth and parent ratings,  which is a substantial  contributor  to psycho-  
logical well-being  in early life and has been linked to functional  neu- 
rodevelopmental  timing in late childhood/adolescence  ( Cummings  and 
Miller-Graﬀ,  2015 ; Harold and Sellers,  2018 ; Petrican  et al., 2021 ). 
Fourth,  likely exposure  to physical  violence/threat  was quantiﬁed  with 
a lifetime  inventory  of traumatic  brain injury. 
Accelerated  biological  aging pace was operationalised  as earlier pu- 
bertal timing (HCP-Development)  or more advanced  menopausal  sta- 
tus (HCP-Aging)  than expected  by chronological  age. Brain matura-  
tion/senescence  was estimated  with both functional  and structural  in- 
dices since there is compelling  evidence  that the two can be diﬀeren-  
tially impacted  by adversity  (cf. Colich et al., 2020 ) and that uncoupling  
of normative  developmental  changes  in structure  and function  may be 
detrimental  (cf. Baum et al., 2020). 
Our core neural marker  was BOLD fMRI signal variability  (BOLD SV ) 
due to its putative  contribution  to ﬂexible  and diﬀerentiated  respond-  
ing to the external  milieu, its role in mediating  environmental  ef- 
fects on long-term  development  and psychiatric  risk, as well as its sus- 
ceptibility  to lifespan  ﬂuctuations  ( Cheng et al., 2021 ; Garrett  et al., 
2021 ; Grady and Garrett,  2018 ; Millar et al., 2020b ; Nomi et al., 2017 ; 
Sheng et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). To capture  mental state-speciﬁc  
eﬀects ( Waschke  et al., 2021 ), BOLD SV was estimated  during wakeful  
rest and during performance  of an externally  oriented  inhibitory  control 
task sensitive  to developmental,  adversity  and psychopathology  eﬀects 
( Grahek  et al., 2019 ; McTeague  et al., 2017 ; Thompson  et al., 2021 ; 
Tozzi et al., 2020 ; Vink et al., 2020 ). 
BOLDsv  is reportedly  foundational  to the development  and main- 
tenance  of functionally  segregated  brain architecture,  the linchpin  of 
eﬃcient  and environmentally  resilient  processing,  whose gradual  emer- 
gence over the ﬁrst two decades  of life and subsequent  decline  from 
late middle-age  onwards  is accelerated  though exposure  to adver- 
sity ( Baracchini  et al., 2021 ; Chan et al., 2014 ; M.Y. 2018 ; Gabard-  
Durnam  et al., 2016 ; Garrett  et al., 2021 ; Geng et al., 2021 ; Grayson  & 
Fair, 2017 ; Hughes  et al., 2020 ; Soldan et al., 2021 ; Tooley et al., 2021 ;

Fig. 1. Schematic  representation  of the conceptual/measurement  model. Adverse  life events were expected  to accelerate  brain development/aging,  both directly 
(panels a-c), and via speeded  biological  maturation  (panels a-b-c). This study focused on recent adversity  (panel a) and sought to control for prior adversity  expo- 
sure (see text). The goal was to identify patterns  of accelerated  brain development/aging  linked to resilience  (panels c-d) and probe their relevance  to long-term  
psychological  vulnerability,  speciﬁcally,  risk for pathologies  characterised  by premature  brain senescence  (panels c-e). Resilience  (panel d) was operationalized  as 
inverse coded total problems  score on the Child Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL, HCP-Development)  or on the Adult Self-Report  (ASR, HCP-Aging)  residualized  for recently  
experienced  adversity  ( in addition  to the other confounders  mentioned  in the Method).  Social problems  are part of the total problems  score only in the CBCL. 
Sporns & Betzel, 2016 ). Relatedly,  resting state BOLDsv  is regarded  as 
a reﬂection  of generic  priors that shape future behavioral  responses  
( Pezzulo  et al., 2021 ). As such, it is relevant  to neurocognitive  eﬃciency,  
operationalised  as reduced  task-resting  state functional  brain reorgani-  
zation for similar behavioral  performance  levels ( Heinzel  et al., 2014 ; 
Neubauer  and Fink, 2009 ). This capacity  is linked to superior  cognitive  
functioning  ( Schultz  and Cole, 2016 ; Thiele et al., 2022 ), declines  with 
age (e.g., greater task-rest  reorganization  in older adults, Hughes  et al., 
2020 ) and ﬂuctuates  with adversity  exposure  ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Thus, in 
addition  to BOLD SV , indices of neurocognitive  eﬃciency  (i.e., reduced  
task-resting  state functional  ﬂexibility)  and specialization  (i.e., resting 
state and task-related  network  diﬀerentiation)  were tested for their rel- 
evance to psychological  resilience.  
To estimate  structural  neurodevelopmental  timing,  we focused  on 
two morphological  brain features,  cortical  thickness  and gray matter 
volume  (GMV).  Both are robustly  associated  with BOLD SV , possibly  via 
synaptic  pruning  processes  ( Faust et al., 2021 ) and vary with age as a re- 
ﬂection  of both typical and pathological  cognitive  changes  ( Giedd et al., 
1999 ; Lindenberger  and Lovden,  2019 ; Millar et al., a , b ; Nadig et al., 
2021 ; Pur et al., 2019 ; Roe et al., 2021 ; Sele et al., 2021 ; Vandekar  et al., 
2015 ). While meta-analytic  evidence  identiﬁes  cortical  thickness  as a 
critical indicator  of adversity-induced  accelerated  neurodevelopment  
( Colich et al., 2020 ), a link between  stress exposure  and GMV is yet 
to be conclusively  established.  Nonetheless,  across the lifespan,  GMV 
ﬂuctuations  track with both short-term  and long-term  variations  in cir- 
culating  gonadal  hormone  levels ( Herting  et al., 2014 ; Kim et al., 2018 ; 
Rehbein  et al., 2021 ). Consequently,  we included  GMV together  with 
cortical  thickness,  reasoning  that it could help explain  biological  aging 
eﬀects on resilience-relevant  brain proﬁles.  
Finally,  we examined  whether  the neural aging mechanisms  under- 
lying psychological  resilience  would be linked to molecular  markers  
suggestive  of increased  long-term  vulnerability  to pathologies  charac-  
terized by premature  brain senescence  ( Cole et al., 2021 ; Dafsari and 
Jessen, 2020 ; Darrow  et al., 2016 ; Fang et al., 2020 ; Han et al., 2021 ). We focused  on Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD), a condition  robustly  linked 
to stress exposure  and accelerated  cellular  aging via low-grade  
systemic  inﬂammation,  whose onset is reportedly  precipitated  by 
earlier mood pathology  ( Beurel et al., 2020 ; Cao et al., 2021 ; 
Dafsari and Jessen, 2020 ; Darrow  et al., 2016 ; Guerrero  et al., 2021 ; 
Harerimana  et al., 2022 ; Jin et al., 2021 ; Lutz et al., 2020 ; Ly et al., 
2021 ; Riddle et al., 2017 ). To test the relationship  between  the neural 
substrates  of short-term  resilience  and molecular  markers  of accelerated  
aging pathology,  we used gene expression  data from the Allen Insti- 
tute of Brain Science.  We thus estimated  the overlap  between  the tran- 
scriptional  signatures  of our resilience-linked  neural proﬁles  and the AD 
polygenic  risk proﬁle derived  from recent meta-analytic  genome-wide  
association  study (GWAS)  results ( Kunkle et al., 2019 ).

2.1. Participants  
The present  research  uses cross-sectional  data preprocessed  by 
the Lifespan  HCP study team and downloaded  in March 2021 as 
part of the 2.0 Data Release  for the HCP-Development  ( www.hcp-  
development.org  ) and HCP-Aging  ( www.hcp-aging.org  ) studies.  The 
two samples  described  below reﬂect the largest number  of biologically  
unrelated  participants  who provided  good quality data on all the vari- 
ables of interest.  We only included  female participants  because  self- 
report measures  of biological  aging were unavailable  for the males in the 
HCP-Aging  sample.  All participants  were screened  for a history of neuro- 
logical,  psychiatric,  endocrine,  genetic  and other serious medical  (e.g., 
diabetes,  two or more seizures)  disorders,  use of psychotropic  drugs, 
head injuries  with loss of consciousness  and/or change in mental func- 
tioning,  and other conditions  or bodily implants  that may render their 
participation  unsafe. Table 1 contains  demographic  information  on both 
samples.

tuation  during resting-state  across smaller  time epochs ( Chen et al., 
2017 ; Tian et al., 2018 ; Xia et al., 2019 ). In a study investigating  FC in 
45-second  sliding windows,  Tian and colleagues  found older adults to 
spend more time in a network  topology  state with lower within-network  
connectivity  ( Tian et al., 2018 ). Although  older adults seemed  to be able 
to reorganize  whole-brain  networks,  the changes  in FC strength  across 
connectivity  states were relatively  weaker  compared  to younger  adults 
( Chen et al., 2017 ; Tian et al., 2018 ). Importantly,  consistently  engaging  
speciﬁc  network  conﬁgurations  at rest was indicative  of better cognitive  
performance  in older adults, suggesting  that the changes  in FC dynamics  
are detrimental  for behavior  ( Cabral et al., 2017 ; Viviano  et al., 2017 ). 
Crucially,  the most often employed  approach  to study dynamic  con- 
nectivity  is to compute  connectivity  in sliding windows  of typically  
30 to 60 seconds  in duration,  which has some noteworthy  limitations  
( Hutchison  et al., 2013 ). For example,  the characterization  of connec-  
tivity in this approach  depends  on the choice of window  length, size 
of the sliding step, and the expected  number  of connectivity  states 
( Shakil et al., 2016 ). Furthermore,  the approach  assumes  a degree of 
correlation  between  the connectivity  states and might consequently  
fail to describe  more instantaneous  changes  in network  conﬁgurations  
( Hindriks  et al., 2016 ). 
It is well established  that the strength  of individual  functional  con- 
nections  ﬂuctuate  over the span of seconds,  markedly  in response  to task 
demands.  Higher task demands  are associated  with patterns  of reinforce-  
ment of task-relevant  network  connectivity,  as well as reduction  of less 
relevant  ones. Converging  evidence  indicates  that older adults retain 
the ability to modulate  functional  networks  according  to the aforemen-  
tioned pattern,  though in a less ﬂexible  manner  compared  to younger  
adults. A considerable  amount  of evidence  has been obtained  in stud- 
ies that deﬁned  connectivity  states across several seconds,  which might 
not properly  characterize  the underlying  individual  network  dynamics.  
Furthermore,  although  a link between  altered connectivity  dynamics  
and cognitive  performance  decline  in older age has been observed  in 
multiple  studies,  much less is known about the relationship  between  
network  ﬂexibility  during resting-state  and motor performance  in the 
context  of aging. Considering  this knowledge  gap and the methodolog-  
ical limitations  of the approach  highlighted  above, our novel strategy  
consisted  of investigating  structured  instantaneous  functional  transients  
using innovation-driven  co-activation  patterns  (ICAP ( Karahano  ğlu and 
Van De Ville, 2015 )) and their association  with subsequent  performance  
in a bimanual  task in a lifespan  cohort. Our main hypothesis  was that 
increasing  age will be associated  with more rigid dynamics  across mul- 
tiple areas in the brain and that this process  will be more prominent  
in an age range similar to the one studied  in our previous  work using 
the same sample ( Monteiro  et al. 2020 ), that is in late middle-aged  and 
older adult subgroups.  We conceptualized  rigidity  to manifest  (a) as a 
reduction  in network  ﬂuctuation  rates as well as (b) a tendency  toward 
the emergence  and fading of multiple  networks  simultaneously,  sugges-  
tive of less diﬀerentiated  whole-brain  network  conﬁgurations  in older 
adults. Furthermore,  we hypothesized  that the age-related  diﬀerences  
in functional  dynamics  are associated  with decrements  in motor behav- 
ior. This relationship  was deemed  to be speciﬁc  to task-related  regions,  
and thus was predicted  to be observable  in areas similar to those where 
we observed  age-related  reduced  modulation  during task execution  in a 
nearly identical  sample from the same cohort ( Monteiro  et al., 2020 ).

2020 ; Vanderwal,  Eilbott,  & Castellanos,  2019 ) and seem to outperform  
rs-fMRI  derived  data in studying  various  neural and behavioral  traits. 
For example,  the use of naturalistic  stimuli has been shown to enhance  
the detection  of unique individual  functional  connectivity  patterns  com- 
pared to rs-fMRI,  possibly  due to increased  arousal  levels during movie- 
watching  ( Vanderwal  et al., 2017 ). Functional  connectivity  data derived  
from movie-watching  has also outperformed  data collected  at rest in 
predicting  cognitive  and emotional  scores ( Finn & Bandettini,  2021 ). 
Notably,  the appropriate  content  to be used in naturalistic  stimuli is de- 
batable  ( Grall & Finn, 2021 ), with diﬀerent  studies employing  diﬀerent  
types of audiovisual  content  such as abstract  videoclips  as opposed  to 
scenes from familiar  ﬁlms ( Vanderwal,  Kelly, Eilbott,  Mayes, & Castel- 
lanos, 2015 ). 
In light of previous  evidence  tightly linking functional  connectivity  
patterns  to task-induced  brain activity,  as well as evidence  demonstrat-  
ing the advantages  of naturalistic  stimuli compared  to rs-fMRI,  in the 
current  work we examine  the predictability  of task-induced  brain ac- 
tivity from patterns  of brain connectivity  while participants  watch a 
naturalistic  stimulus.  We hypothesize  that brain-connectivity  data de- 
rived from movie-watching  fMRI will be successful  at predicting  individ-  
ual task-evoked  neural activity  across a range of cognitive  paradigms.  
Moreover,  we expect prediction  of activation  maps from naturalistic-  
stimulus  data to outperform  prediction  from rs-fMRI  data, and to suc- 
cessfully  detect individually  unique activation  patterns.  We additionally  
compare  the accuracy  of task-activation  maps predicted  from diﬀerent  
types of naturalistic  stimuli (Hollywood  scenes (HO) vs. independent  
ﬁlms made available  under creative  commons  license (CC)). Finally,  we 
demonstrate  the predictability  of cognitive  scores from the predicted  
task-induced  activation  maps derived  from functional  connectivity  data 
collected  using a naturalistic  stimulus,  compared  to functional  connec-  
tivity data collected  using rs-fMRI.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
The data used in this study were provided  by the Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP; Van Essen et al., 2013 ). While the HCP dataset in- 
cludes over 1000 participants,  only a subset of 184 participants  were 
scanned  during naturalistic  stimuli viewing,  from which 175 partici-  
pants were reported  by the HCP to have good quality data. Naturalistic  
stimuli fMRI scans were performed  on a 7 Tesla Siemens  Magnetom.  
Since this work focuses  on naturalistic  stimuli,  we used this subset of 
participants  for whom naturalistic  viewing  data were available.  Besides  
movie-watching  scans, these participants  were also scanned  at rest on 
both 7T and 3T scanners,  and during task performance  on a 3T scan- 
ner. Participants  that did not complete  all movie-watching,  resting-state  
and task fMRI scans were excluded  from this study, resulting  in a ﬁnal 
dataset of n = 153 (mean age = 29.5, standard  deviation  =",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5619, 5622), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(3494, 3497), match=' 3.'>"

the stages of neural processes  underlying  covert attention  states such as 
mind wandering  as it unfolds  over time. 
Early scalp EEG studies examining  the electrophysiological  corre- 
lates of mind wandering  have primarily  utilized  event-related  potentials  
(ERP) components.  This type of measure  reﬂects  neural activity  that is 
time-locked  to a sensory,  cognitive,  or motor event, characterized  by 
their polarity  (i.e., positive  or negative  going wave), amplitude,  latency,  
and scalp distribution.  Decades  of research  have established  ERP com- 
ponents  as useful biomarkers  of cognitive  operations,  and indications  
of conditional  or group diﬀerences  ( Handy,  2005 ; Luck, 2005 ). Given 
the precise temporal  resolution  of scalp EEG recordings,  ERP compo-  
nents capture  electrophysiological  activity  on the order of milliseconds  
and thus reveal diﬀerent  stages of information  processing.  In particu-  
lar, they can be categorized  into early components,  primarily  reﬂecting  
sensory  level processing,  and later components,  mainly characterizing  
cognitive  level processes.  This enables  the examination  of which stage 
of stimulus-evoked  processing  is disrupted  during mind wandering.  In 
the context  of mind wandering,  the most commonly  reported  ERP com- 
ponents  are the P1 in response  to visual stimuli,  indexing  sensory  level 
visual processing  (Mangun  & Hillyard,  1991), and the P3, indexing  cog- 
nitive level processes  such as context  updating,  resource  allocation,  and 
working  memory  load ( Polich, 2007 ). As the functional  interpretation  
of ERP components  depends  on the task and its stimuli,  a variety of 
cognitive  processes  indexed  by this measure  have been examined  in a 
diverse  range of tasks employed  to study mind wandering.  Therefore,  
not only do ERP components  serve as electrophysiological  correlates  of 
mind wandering,  they also reveal the stage and type of processes  that 
are impacted  when the mind wanders.  
In addition  to ERP components,  an increasing  number  of mind wan- 
dering studies have reported  on spectral  features  of EEG data unfold-  
ing over time. This requires  decomposition  of the EEG signal into the 
time-frequency  domain,  in which signals are characterized  by their 
frequency,  amplitude,  phase, and spatial distribution.  Commonly  cat- 
egorized  into canonical  frequency  bands (i.e., delta (1-4Hz),  theta (4- 
8Hz), alpha (8-14Hz),  beta (15-30Hz),  and gamma  (30-50Hz))  these 
signals are presumed  to reﬂect oscillatory  activity  that have function-  
ally distinct  roles in human cognition  ( Ward, 2003 ). Given brain os- 
cillations  have been shown to facilitate  communication  within the 
brain ( Fries, 2015 ; Varela et al., 2001 ), they not only serve as EEG 
markers  of mind wandering  but they can also inform potential  neural 
mechanisms  underlying  this phenomenon.  For example,  the inhibitory  
role of alpha band has been purported  to be the electrophysiologi-  
cal mechanism  underlying  selective  attention  ( Foxe and Snyder,  2011 ; 
Jensen and Mazaheri,  2010 ). It has also been linked to visual atten- 
tion and alertness  ( Klimesch  et al., 1998 ; Sauseng  et al., 2005 ). Like- 
wise, ample evidence  suggests  that theta rhythms  within and across 
brain regions  subserve  memory  processes  ( Buzsáki,  2005 ), as well as 
attentional  functions  ( Helfrich  et la., 2018 ) and executive  control func- 
tions ( Cavanaugh  & Frank, 2014 ). Building  upon our current  under- 
standing  of mechanistic  roles of canonical  frequency  bands, EEG stud- 
ies examining  spectral  features  may uncover  how they facilitate  mind 
wandering.  
In this review,  we systematically  evaluate  evidence  of electrophys-  
iological  markers  of mind wandering  in healthy  adults. Despite  the in- 
creasing  interest  in examining  this phenomenon  using EEG, there has 
been no comprehensive  review thus far that summarizes  and accounts  
for the variable  ﬁndings  in the ﬁeld. To bridge the gap, this system-  
atic review synthesizes  studies reporting  scalp EEG measures  of mind 
wandering.  Although  numerous  deﬁnitions  of mind wandering  exist, we 
focused  on studies that adopted  the most common  conceptualizations  
of mind wandering:  task-unrelated  thought  and stimulus-independent  
thought  ( Smallwood  & Schooler,  2015 ). Our review of this growing  body 
of literature  will inform future endeavours  in basic science  to reveal elec- 
trophysiological  mechanisms  underlying  mind wandering  and in trans- 
lational  science  to use EEG to predict the occurrence  of this ubiquitous  
phenomenon.  2. Methods  
This systematic  review was conducted  in accordance  with the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items for Systematic  Reviews  and Meta-Analyses  
(PRISMA)  guidelines  ( Moher et al., 2009 ). The review protocol  was cre- 
ated using the International  Prospective  Register  of Systematic  Reviews  
(PROSPERO)  template  and preregistered  on Open Science  Framework  
( https://osf.io/t492p/  ). 
2.1. Search Strategy  
To identify  relevant  studies on the EEG markers  of mind wander-  
ing in healthy  adults, we performed  a comprehensive  search using the 
following  electronic  databases:  PsycINFO  (OVID),  Medline  (PubMed),  
Scopus (Academic  Search Complete),  Web of Science  Core Collection  
(Web of Science),  IEEE Xplore Digital Library  (IEEE Xplore),  as well 
as ProQuest  (for grey literature  involving  materials  published  outside  
of traditional  publication  channels  such as preprints)  between  June 4 th 
and 5 th 2021. Only empirical  articles  written  in English  were consid-  
ered, and no restrictions  were applied  on publication  dates. Search terms 
were derived  from the two core concepts  in our review,  mind wander-  
ing and EEG, and were restricted  to the Title, Keywords,  and Abstract  
sections  in our search. Mind wandering  terms included  “mind wander-  
ing ”, “task-unrelated  thought  ”, “stimulus-independent  thought  ”, “oﬀ- 
task state ”, “spontaneous  thought  ”, and “internal  attention  ”. These were 
searched  in conjunction  with EEG terms, which included  “EEG ”, “elec- 
troencephalogram  ”, “event-related  potentials  ”or “ERP ”, “event-related  
spectral  perturbation  ”or “ERSP ”, “frequency  power ”, “oscillatory  activ- 
ity ”, “delta ”, “theta ”, “alpha ”, “beta ”, and “gamma  ”. Search syntax and 
strategies  were tailored  to each search engine to ensure all search terms 
and their variations  were considered.  To ensure literature  saturation,  
we also reviewed  the reference  section of all included  articles  as well as 
related major systematic  reviews  or meta-analyses.  
2.2. Selection  Criteria  
Our inclusion  criteria  consisted  of empirical  studies 1) involv- 
ing scalp EEG recordings  obtained  from healthy  adults aged 18-65; 2) re- 
porting  scalp EEG measures  associated  with mind wandering;  3) report- 
ing descriptive  statistics  of EEG measures  and corresponding  statistical  
analyses;  and 4) using online, retrospective,  or questionnaire-based  self- 
report measures  of mind wandering.  These criteria  were implemented  
to ensure that scalp EEG measures  were obtained,  and such data were 
statistically  analyzed  allowing  for inferences  to be made about mind 
wandering.  We only considered  studies that used self-report  measures  
of mind wandering,  as they provide  a direct assessment  of one’s atten- 
tional state. This includes  experience  sampling  or online measures,  in 
which one reports when they catch themselves  mind wandering  (i.e., 
self-caught)  or reports their attentional  state as prompted  by the ex- 
perimenter  occasionally  throughout  the task (i.e., probe-caught);  ret- 
rospective  measures,  which involves  a subjective  report of one’s over- 
all attention  during a task upon task completion;  and trait question-  
naires, which requires  individuals  to report their trait level propensity  
for mind wandering.  Within the experience  sampling  approach,  the main 
diﬀerence  between  self-caught  and probe-caught  measures  is that the 
former involves  a heightened  sense of meta-awareness  ( Smallwood  & 
Schooler,  2006 ; 2015 ). In contrast  to experience  sampling  measures  
which capture  mind wandering  in the moment,  the retrospective  self- 
report approach  requires  one to reﬂect upon how often they mind wan- 
dered during a task upon task completion,  and the trait questionnaire  
approach  assesses  overall tendencies  to mind wander  in everyday  life. 
These subjective  self-report  measures  avoid the need for researchers  to 
make inferences  about participants’  attentional  states based on their be- 
haviour.  Further,  studies involving  clinical  populations  were included  
only if they reported  statistical  analyses  on mind wandering  measures  
for a healthy  control group.

The following  exclusion  criteria  were also implemented:  1) rest- 
ing state with no self-report  measure  of mind wandering;  2) mind wan- 
dering measure  based on inferences  (e.g., behavioral  measures);  3) si- 
multaneous  recordings  of EEG and other neuroimaging  measures  if EEG 
measures  were not independently  reported;  4) multivariate  analyses  
(e.g., machine  learning)  in the absence  of statistical  analyses  of univari-  
ate measures,  or 5) reviews,  meta-analyses,  opinion  pieces, and case 
studies.  We implemented  a two-stage  screening  process.  At stage one, 
two authors  (T.R. and Y.P.) independently  screened  the titles, abstracts,  
and keywords  according  to the above selection  criteria  in Covidence,  an 
online platform  designed  to manage  systematic  reviews.  In cases of con- 
ﬂict between  the two authors  with respect to inclusion  versus exclusion,  
a third author (J.W.Y.K.)  made a ﬁnal decision  upon discussion  with the 
other two authors.  At stage two, T.R. and Y. P. screened  full-text  articles  
that were considered  eligible  from stage one.

social interaction  often involves  both visual (e.g., facial aﬀect, gestures,  
signs) and auditory  cues (e.g., words, wailing,  shouting),  AVI is also 
considered  to scaﬀold  social cognition.  Investigating  AVI is therefore  
critical,  as deﬁcits  in this ability may not only impede  the normal  devel- 
opment  of the above mentioned  cognitive  abilities,  but also contribute  
to speciﬁc  disorders,  such as dyslexia  ( Yang et al., 2020 ; Ye et al., 2017 ) 
and schizophrenia  ( de Jong et al., 2009 ; Pearl et al., 2009 ). 
1.2. Adult audiovisual  integration  and its neural foundation  
The neural foundation  of AVI has been extensively  studied  in adults 
and includes  portions  of the auditory,  visual, frontal,  parietal  and tem- 
poral cortices  ( Dick et al., 2010 ; Hickok et al., 2018 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). 
The recruitment  of these brain areas varies as a function  of stimulus  
properties.  For instance,  the inferior  frontal gyrus (IFG), a brain region 
typically  involved  in speech production,  has been shown to be active 
during AVI of speech-related  stimuli ( Baumann  et al., 2018 ; Biau et al., 
2016 ; Ojanen  et al., 2005 ). Similarly,  varying  the temporal  synchrony  
of audiovisual  (AV) stimuli,  and whether  or not AV speech stimuli are 
in conﬂict,  may lead to the recruitment  of diﬀerent  portions  of the su- 
perior temporal  sulcus (STS; Erickson  et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). In 
a recent review and metaanalysis,  Zhou et al. (2020) proposed  a brain 
network  supporting  temporal  AVI, whose recruitment  follows  a multi- 
level organization:  Initial AV information  processing  takes place in the 
primary  sensory  cortices.  Signals are then transmitted  to associative  ar- 
eas, of which the STS is central.  In fact, the STS is regarded  as the hub 
for MSI (see also Nath and Beauchamp,  2012 ). If stimuli are speech-  
related,  the IFG and the premotor  cortex (PreM) are likely to be involved  
as well. The anterior  cingulate  cortex (ACC), the anterior  insula, and the 
prefrontal  cortex, mainly the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), are addition-  
ally activated  under particular  AV conditions  and at a higher cognitive  
level. For instance,  these brain regions  facilitate  detection  of temporal  
misalignment,  error monitoring  and correction,  and resolution  of con- 
ﬂicting stimuli ( Zhou et al., 2020 ).

ticular,  has been shown to lead to insuﬃcient  adaptation  in the face 
of environmental  change ( Browning  et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2017 ), 
disruption  in learning,  and maladaptive  biases —in both aversive  and

Kim et al., 2020 ; Lamba et al., 2020 ; Piray et al., 2019 ; Pulcu and

ated by oscillatory  changes  representing  predictions  and pwPEs remains  
unknown.  
Within the Bayesian  PC framework,  growing  evidence  supports  that, 
during perception,  feedforward  PE signals are encoded  by gamma  os- 
cillations  ( > 30 Hz), while backward  connections  convey predictions  ex- 
pressed  in alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations  ( Arnal and 
Giraud,  2012 ; Bastos et al., 2015 ; van Pelt et al., 2016 ; Wang, 2010 ). 
Precision  weights  are also modulated  by alpha and beta oscillations  
( Palmer et al., 2019 ; Sedley et al., 2016 ). Because  precision  weights  
scale PEs during Bayesian  inference  and learning  ( Feldman  and Fris- 
ton, 2010 ; Friston,  2010 ), the modulation  of pwPE signals could be ex- 
pressed  both in gamma  and alpha/beta  activity,  as recent work sug- 
gests ( Auksztulewicz  et al., 2017 ). Speciﬁcally,  gamma  increases  during 
pwPE encoding  are accompanied  by attenuated  alpha and beta activ- 
ity ( Auksztulewicz  et al., 2017 ). Indeed,  gamma  and alpha/beta  oscilla- 
tory rhythms  are anticorrelated  across the cortex, as shown in investi-  
gations  of prediction  violations  ( Bastos et al., 2020 ; Bastos, 2018 ) and 
during working  memory  ( Lundqvist  et al., 2020 , 2016 ; Miller et al., 
2018 ). Complementing  these ﬁndings,  we recently  showed  that ab- 
normal  increases  in beta power and burst rate can account  for the 
dampening  of pwPEs during reward-based  motor learning  in anxiety  
( Sporn et al., 2020 ). Moreover,  gamma  oscillations  in the dorsome-  
dial prefrontal  cortex (dmPFC)  are associated  with unsigned  PEs during 
exploration-exploitation  behaviour  ( Domenech  et al., 2020 ), suggesting  
cortical  gamma  activity  as a relevant  correlate  of reward-based  learn- 
ing. Accordingly,  we speculated  that decreased  anxiety-related  learn- 
ing during decision  making  could be associated  with abnormally  en- 
hanced  beta in addition  to reduced  gamma  oscillations  during pwPE 
processing.  
Predictions  have been consistently  associated  with the modula-  
tion of alpha-beta  rhythms  across multiple  modalities,  such as visual 
( Gould et al., 2011 ), motor ( Schoﬀelen  et al., 2005 ), somatosensory  
( van Ede et al., 2011 ), and auditory  ( Todorovic  et al., 2015 ) —yet 
frequency-domain  evidence  for predictions  about reward contingen-  
cies in volatile  environments  is currently  lacking.  This is important  
to understand  as learning  biases manifest  in anxiety  conditions  dur- 
ing environmental  instability  ( Browning  et al., 2015 ; Pulcu and Brown-  
ing, 2019 ). Crucially,  predictions  in deep layers are thought  to function-  
ally inhibit the processing  of sensory  input and PEs in superﬁcial  layers 
( Bastos et al., 2015 ; Bauer et al., 2014 ; Mayer et al., 2016 ; Van Kerkoerle  
et al., 2014 ). This suggests  that aberrant  oscillatory  states modulating  
predictions  would be an additional  route through  which encoding  of 
pwPEs is altered,  contributing  to impaired  learning.  
Here, we used convolution  modelling  of oscillatory  responses  
( Litvak et al., 2013 ) in previously  acquired  EEG data to estimate  the neu- 
ral oscillatory  representations  of predictions  and pwPEs during reward-  
based learning  in healthy  controls  and a state anxious  group. Our pre- 
vious computational  modelling  study ( Hein et al., 2021 ) revealed  that 
state anxiety  biases uncertainty  estimates,  increasing  the precision  of 
posterior  beliefs about the stimulus-reward  contingency.  We now ask 
whether  this bias is associated  with altered spectral  characteristics  of 
hierarchical  message  passing,  which could represent  a candidate  marker  
of biased belief updating  and poorer reward-based  learning  in anxiety.  
We hypothesised  that, in state anxiety,  increased  precision  in the predic- 
tions about a certain stimulus-reward  contingency  should be associated  
with increased  alpha and beta activity.  This, in turn, would inhibit the 
processing  of expected  inputs in line with PC accounts,  resulting  in a hy- 
pothesised  lower gamma  activity  and concomitantly  higher alpha-beta  
activity  for attenuating  encoding  of pwPEs.  2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participant  sample 
The data used in the preparation  of this work were obtained  from our 
previous  study Hein et al. (2021) , which was approved  by the ethical re- 
view committee  at Goldsmiths,  University  of London.  Participants  were 
pseudo-randomly  allocated  into an experimental  state anxiety  (StA) and 
control (Cont) group, following  a screening  phase in which we measured  
trait anxiety  levels in each participant  using Spielberger’s  Trait Anxiety  
Inventory  (STAI; Spielberger,  1983 ). Trait anxiety  levels were matched  
in StA and Cont groups (average  score and standard  error of the mean, 
SEM: 47 [2.1] in StA, 46 [2.2] in Cont). Importantly,  individual  trait 
anxiety  scores above 46 have been shown to be typical in anxiety  disor- 
der patients  ( Fisher and Durham,  1999 ), suggesting  that a proportion  of 
our participants  had relatively  high trait anxiety  levels. Further,  the age 
of the control group (mean 27.7, SEM = 1.2) and their sex (13 female,  
8 male) were consistent  with those from the state anxiety  group (mean 
27.5, SEM = 1.3, sex 14 female,  7 male). This is important  to consider  
as there are known age and sex-related  confounds  to measures  of state 
anxiety  (see Voss et al., 2015 ). 
2.2. Experimental  design 
Both groups (StA, Cont) performed  a probabilistic  binary reward-  
based learning  task where the probability  of reward between  two im- 
ages changes  across time ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ; de Berker et al., 2016 ; 
Iglesias  et al., 2013 ). The experiment  was divided  into four blocks: an 
initial resting state block (R1: baseline),  two reward-based  learning  task 
blocks (TB1, TB2), and a ﬁnal resting state block (R2). Each resting 
state block was 5 min. Participants  were instructed  to relax and keep 
their eyes open and ﬁxated on a cross in the middle of the presenta-  
tion screen while we recorded  EEG responses  from the scalp and EKG 
responses  from the heart. 
The experimental  task consisted  of 200 trials in each task block (TB1, 
TB2). The aim was for participants  to maximise  reward across all tri- 
als by predicting  which of the two images (blue, orange)  would reward 
them (win, positive  reinforcement,  5 pence reward)  or not (lose, 0 pence 
reward).  The probability  governing  reward for each stimulus  (recipro-  
cal: p, 1 − p) changed  across the experiment,  every 26 to 38 trials. There 
were 10 contingency  mappings  for both task blocks: 2 x strongly  biased 
(90/10;  i.e. probability  of reward for blue p = 0.9), 2 x moderately  biased 
(70/30),  and 2 x unbiased  (50/50:  as in de Berker et al., 2016 ). The bi- 
ased mappings  repeated  in reverse  relationships  (2 ×10/90; 2 ×30/70) 
to ensure that over the two blocks (TB1, TB2) there were 10 stimulus-  
outcome  contingency  phases in total. 
In each trial the stimuli were presented  randomly  to the left or right 
of the centre of the screen where they remained  until either a response  
was given (left, right) or the trial expired  (maximum  waiting  time, 
2200 ms ± 200 ms). Next, the chosen image was highlighted  in bright 
green for 1200 ms ( ± 200 ms) before the outcome  (win, green; lose or 
no response,  red) was shown in the middle of the screen (1200 ms ± 
200 ms). At the end of each trial, the outcome  was replaced  by a ﬁxa- 
tion cross at an inter-trial  interval  of 1250 ms ( ± 250 ms). 
Speciﬁc  task instructions  to participants  were to select which image 
they predicted  would reward them on each trial and adjust their predic- 
tions according  to inferred  changes  in the probability  of reward (as in 
de Berker et al., 2016 ). All participants  ﬁlled out computerised  question-  
naires (state anxiety  STAI state scale X1, 20 items: Spielberger,  1983 ) 
and conducted  practice  trials as detailed  in Hein et al. (2021) . Criti- 
cally, the state anxiety  manipulation  was delivered  just before the ﬁrst 
reward-based  learning  block (TB1) to the StA group (see the following  
section).

ogy and are evolving  rapidly.  There are multiple  ways in which sensors  
can be designed  and fabricated,  and it is not yet clear which design will 
ultimately  prove the most beneﬁcial  for biomagnetic  measurement.  
At a basic level (see Tierney  et al. (2019) for a review)  an OPM com- 
prises a cell containing  a vapour of alkali atoms. A laser is shone through  
the cell and photons  interact  with the atoms, causing  both a shift in both 
atomic energy level and angular  momentum.  In a zero-ﬁeld  environment  
and with sensors  operated  in the spin-exchange  relaxation-free  (SERF) 
regime,  absorption  of circularly  polarised  photons  by atoms in the gas 
(optical  pumping)  causes an alignment  of angular  momenta,  and conse- 
quently  atomic magnetic  moments.  If zero ﬁeld is maintained,  the atoms 
become  trapped  in the same quantum  state and their aligned  magnetic  
moments  mean that the vapour is magnetised.  Once in this state, the 
bulk magnetisation  interacts  with an external  ﬁeld (e.g., the ﬁeld from 
the brain) according  to the Bloch Equations  ( Bloch, 1946 ). There are a 
number  of schemes  to then “read out ”the local ﬁeld and the scheme  used 
in most commercial  sensors  relies on the fact that, around the zero-ﬁeld  
point, the amount  of light that passes through  the vapour is a Lorentzian  
function  of ﬁeld ( Dupont-Roc  et al., 1969 ). This is of limited value since 
the symmetry  of the Lorentzian  means one cannot infer ﬁeld direction.  
However,  in the presence  of an oscillating  “modulation  ”ﬁeld, one can 
measure  the magnetic  ﬁeld component  orthogonal  to the laser beam 
( Cohen-Tannoudji  et al., 1970 ). By using two modulation  ﬁelds sepa- 
rated in phase or frequency,  it becomes  possible  to measure  magnetic  
ﬁeld in two orientations,  perpendicular  to the beam, simultaneously.  
Most OPM-MEG  measurements  have employed  this read-out,  and 
ﬁelds have been measured  in either one orientation  (usually  radial to the 
scalp surface)  or two orientations.  However,  recent developments  have 
enabled  an extension  to this scheme.  Speciﬁcally,  two orthogonally-  
oriented  laser beams can be projected  simultaneously  through  the same 
cell. Judicious  control of modulating  ﬁelds then enables  four ﬁeld mea- 
surements  (perpendicular  to both beams).  Signiﬁcant  challenges  result 
from this design, since the two beams are most easily produced  by a 
beam splitter,  which halves the beam power, and thus diminishes  sensi- 
tivity of the sensor. Nevertheless,  if suﬃcient  sensitivity  can be achieved  
to measure  the neuromagnetic  ﬁeld, such a system ostensibly  allows 
a complete  3D vector measurement  of the local magnetic  ﬁeld inside 
the vapour cell, and consequently  oﬀers the promise  of a MEG system 
where the vector ﬁeld is measured  at many locations  across the scalp 
surface.  
The extent to which 3D vector ﬁeld characterisation  is useful for 
MEG is debatable.  Theory ( Sarvas, 1987 ) suggests  that, assuming  the 
head is a spherical  homogeneous  conductor  and the extracranial  space 
is current-free,  if we know the radial component  of ﬁeld at all points on 
the spherical  surface of the conductor,  this can be used to derive the lo- 
cal magnetic  scalar potential.  The scalar potential  can, in turn, be used 
to derive the 3D vector ﬁeld. This means that independent  measurement  
of tangential  ﬁeld components  would oﬀer no additional  information,  
beyond  what could be gained from the radial ﬁeld only, and so triaxial  
measurement  is of limited value. However,  in a practical  MEG experi- 
ment, the addition  of triaxial  measurement  has three eﬀects: 1) Finite 
spatial sampling  means that we do not know the radial ﬁeld everywhere,  
and it is possible  that there could be gaps in our sensitivity  to the under- 
lying sources,  particularly  for shallow  currents  immediately  beneath  a 
radially-oriented  sensor. Triaxial  measurements  might ﬁll those gaps. 2) 
Not all magnetic  ﬁelds originate  from inside the brain: interference  ﬁelds 
from other sources  (either biological  or environmental)  will be detected  
and these can be better characterised  (and ultimately  removed)  via tri- 
axial, rather than radial measurement  ( Brookes  et al., 2021 ). 3) Triaxial  
sensors  provide  three times more measurements:  tangential  ﬁelds are 
known to be weaker  than radial ﬁelds ( Iivanainen  et al., 2017 ) and so 
this does not equate to three times more signal; nevertheless  tangen-  
tial sensors  can be used to boost overall signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR). For 
these reasons,  it is likely that the measurement  of ﬁeld vectors  in MEG 
might oﬀer signiﬁcant  practical  advantages.  Triaxial  measurement  is not an exclusive  property  of OPMs. Pre- 
vious work has seen construction  of a complete  triaxial  sensor array 
based on SQUIDs  ( Haueisen  et al., 2012 ). Furthermore,  construction  of 
a SQUID array with a small number  of rotated  sensors  has been shown 
to oﬀer practical  advantages  for rejection  of interference  (using signal 
space separation,  Nurminen  et al., (2013) ). However,  the construction  
of triaxial  SQUID arrays is complicated  due to the required  geometry  of 
the ﬂux transformers.  Further,  each triaxial  sensor requires  three sepa- 
rately wired ﬂux transformers,  three independent  SQUIDs,  and associ- 
ated electronics.  In contrast,  construction  of a triaxial  OPM is relatively  
straightforward  because  the three measurements  can share a single cell, 
laser, coils and electronics.  In short, triaxial  OPMs can be constructed  
at relatively  little extra cost, and so ostensibly  oﬀer an “easy ”route to 
improving  OPM-MEG  eﬃcacy  by tripling  the number  of channels.  
In this paper, we assess the viability  of triaxial  OPM-MEG.  The pa- 
per is split into two parts: in the ﬁrst part we describe  the operation  of a 
newly available,  commercial  (QuSpin  Inc.) low-noise,  triaxial  OPM, and 
perform  an evaluation  of its performance  –paying  particular  attention  
to its sensitivity  since (as noted above) this poses a signiﬁcant  challenge  
due to the need for two orthogonal  laser beams. We characterise  the 
noise ﬂoor of the new sensor, demonstrate  accuracy  using phantom  ex- 
periments  and test sensitivity  to biomagnetic  ﬁelds from the heart and 
brain. In the second part of the paper, we assess the utility of triaxial  
sensors  in paediatric  applications.  In simulation,  we show why a triax- 
ial sensor might oﬀer better spatial coverage  compared  to conventional  
arrays. We then go on to deploy triaxial  sensors  to make MEG measure-  
ments in a child. 
2. Part 1–Sensor  validation  
2.1. The triaxial sensor 
The triaxial  sensor ( www.quspin.com  ; Osborne  et al., (2020) ) is a sin- 
gle self-contained  unit ( Fig. 2 a) comprising:  1) a glass cell (3x 3x 3 mm 3 ) 
housing  a mixture  of 87 Rb vapour and buﬀer gas (nitrogen),  2) a single 
laser diode tuned to the D1 transition  of 87 Rb (795-nm  wavelength),  
with associated  optics to circularly  polarise  the light generated,  3) two 
independent  photodetectors  and 4) three orthogonal  pairs of electro-  
magnetic  coils to control magnetic  ﬁeld inside the cell. The laser beam 
is projected  through  a beam splitter and the two resultant  beams are 
shone through  the cell in orthogonal  directions  ( Fig. 1 a). Care is taken 
to ensure that the two beams have a minimal  overlap  (spatial  separation  
∼0.65 ± 0.25 mm). The buﬀer gas minimises  collisions  between  the Rb 
atoms and the cell wall, and minimises  diﬀusion  of the polarised  atoms 
between  the beams (the diﬀusion  length over the ∼3-ms coherence  time 
(i.e., the time the atoms stay polarised)  is < 1 mm). Independent  pho- 
todetectors  detect the amplitude  of light from both beams, after passing  
through  the cell. The two beams optically  pump the Rb atoms and, in a 
zero-ﬁeld  environment,  the magnetic  moments  of atoms align with the 
beam orientation  ( Fig. 1 a). The bulk magnetisation  of the atoms inter- 
acts with external  magnetic  ﬁelds and evolves  according  to the Bloch 
equations.  
The vapour cell is enclosed  in a set of three axis coils ( Fig. 1 b). 
These not only help to ensure zero ﬁeld inside the cell (by nulling 
any residual  static bias ﬁeld inside the cell), but also provide  oscillat-  
ing modulation  ﬁelds to enable lock-in ampliﬁer-based  signal process-  
ing. Take the example  of Beam 1 (travelling  in the z direction  through  
the cell); we assume  that we want to measure  a ﬁeld, 𝐵 𝑦 , oriented  in 
the y direction,  and to do so we apply a modulation  ﬁeld, of a form 
𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑦 = 𝐵 1 sin ( 2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ) , also in the y direction.  𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 is the modulation  
frequency  (typically  ∼1 kHz) and t represents  time. The solution  to the 
Bloch equations  shows that the polarisation  of atoms in the beam path 
is given by ( Cohen-Tannoudji  et al., 1970 ) 
𝑃 𝑧 = 𝑃 0 𝐽 0 ( 𝛾𝐵 1 
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 ) 
𝐽 1 ( 𝛾𝐵 1 
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 ) 𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ). (1)

Fig. 1. Schematic  of the triaxial OPM. a) A single laser, coupled with a beam splitter, allows two independent,  circularly-polarised  795 nm wavelength  laser beams 
to be projected  through  a 87 Rb cell. Both independently  facilitate  optical pumping.  b) On-board  sensor coils provide modulation  ﬁelds in the x, y and z directions.  A 
ﬁeld along the axis of a beam has no eﬀect on the atoms. Consequently,  only two orthogonal  modulation  signals (sine waves with 0°and 90°phase  shifts) are needed 
to read out signals in three orthogonal  orientations.  c) Schematic  illustrations  of the eﬀect of three external  (e.g. neuromagnetic)  ﬁelds: the atoms in the path of 
Beam 1 are sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in x and y. The atoms in the path of Beam 2 are sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in y and z. 
Here, 𝑃 0 is the eﬀective  equilibrium  polarisation  of the cell following  
optical pumping.  𝛾is the gyromagnetic  ratio and 𝜏represents  a time 
constant  governing  relaxation  of polarisation  to equilibrium.  𝐽 0 and 𝐽 1 
are Bessel functions  of the ﬁrst kind which, in this case, collapse  to con- 
stants. The signal measured  at photodetector  1, 𝑉 1 , is directly  propor-  
tional to 𝑃 𝑧 , such that 
𝑉 1 ∝𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ). (2) 
A lock-in ampliﬁer  can then be used to eliminate  the sinusoidal  mod- 
ulation (and increase  SNR), leaving  a signal which is proportional  to 
𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1+ ( 𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏) 2 . Consequently,  𝑉 1 is approximately  linear with ﬁeld around 
𝐵 𝑦 = 0 . This allows inference  on the ﬁeld of interest,  𝐵 𝑦 . 
In a similar way, we could measure  a ﬁeld oriented  in the x direction,  
since symmetry  suggests  the solutions  to the Bloch equations  would be 
identical,  as long as the modulation  ﬁeld is also oriented  along the x 
direction.  However,  it is equally  possible  to measure  the two ﬁelds ( 𝐵 𝑦 
and 𝐵 𝑥 ) simultaneously  by applying  𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑦 and 𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑥 modulation  ﬁelds 
at the same time. The two modulation  ﬁelds can be applied  at the same 
frequency  and the 𝐵 𝑥 and 𝐵 𝑦 measurements  separated  by adding a 90°
phase lag between  x and y modulation  currents.  In such a scheme,  we 
get two superimposed  signals at the photodetector,  the ﬁrst given by Eq. 
(2 ), and the second by 
𝑉 2 ∝𝛾𝐵 𝑥 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑥 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 + 𝜋

The orthogonality  of the sine terms, imposed  by the phase oﬀset, enables  
a lock-in ampliﬁer  to detect both signals independently.  In this way, one 
can measure  ﬁeld at two orientations,  with a single beam. 
For the triaxial  sensor, we have two beams which are probed by two 
photodetectors,  independently.  Beam 1 is sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in 
x and y (but not z ). Beam 2 is sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in y and z (but 
not x ). This is shown schematically  in Fig. 1 c. Note that the addition  
of a modulation  ﬁeld along the orientation  of the laser beam has no ﬁrst-order  eﬀect on the atoms, and so we can use the same modulation  
frequency  and phase for the x and z directions  as the atoms in Beam 1 
are largely unimpacted  by the z modulation  ﬁeld and the atoms in Beam 
2 are similarly  unaﬀected  by the x modulation  ﬁeld. The result is two 
independent  measures  of 𝐵 𝑦 (which are averaged  together)  alongside  
a single, simultaneous,  measurement  of 𝐵 𝑥 and 𝐵 𝑧 . Combining  these 
provides  a complete  triaxial  ﬁeld characterisation.  
2.2. Methods  
Our aim in part one of the paper is to evaluate  this form of triaxial  
OPM sensor, demonstrating  that: 
1 It oﬀers an accurate  record of magnetic  ﬁeld vectors  
2 It has suﬃcient  sensitivity  to assess biomagnetic  ﬁelds. 
With these aims in mind, we undertook  four experiments:  
2.2.1. Noise measurements  
Four triaxial  OPMs (QuSpin  Inc. CO, USA) were operated  in a single 
array. The sensors  were placed at the centre of a magnetically-shielded  
room (MSR) in an ambient  background  ﬁeld of approximately  2 nT. A 
separate  array of 11 standard  (i.e., single-beam  and dual-axis)  OPMs 
were positioned  at approximately  the same location.  90 s of data were 
simultaneously  recorded  from both arrays, at a sample frequency  of 
1,200 Hz, using a National  Instruments  digital acquisition  system in- 
terfaced  to a PC. The resulting  data were segmented  into 10-s windows.  
The power spectral  density  within each window  was computed  using 
the Matlab (Mathworks  Inc.) ‘periodogram’  function  with a ﬂattop win- 
dow, over a frequency  range 0 to 100 Hz (resolution  of 0.1 Hz). The 
median  of the power spectral  density  across windows  was then taken 
and plotted,  providing  an accurate  representation  of the sensor noise 
ﬂoor as a function  of frequency.  The triaxial  sensors  were compared  to 
the dual-axis  sensors  to probe the consistency  of noise ﬂoor across the 
two sensor types.

2.2.2. Phantom  measurements  
A current  dipole phantom  ( Fig. 3 a) was used to generate  a mag- 
netic ﬁeld with a known spatial signature.  The phantom  itself was a 3D- 
printed  (Chalk Studios  Ltd.) nylon sphere of radius 5.5 cm containing  a 
saline solution  (8 % concentration).  The sphere was surrounded  by 25 
slots into which OPMs could be inserted.  Slots were (approximately)  uni- 
formly distributed  over the upper hemisphere  and oriented  such ﬁelds 
along the radial ( ̂𝑟 𝑜 ), polar ( ̂𝜃𝑜 ) and azimuth  ( ̂𝜙𝑜 ) orientations  could be 
measured.  (The subscript  ‘ o ’ denotes  that these orientations  are deﬁned  
at the location  of the OPM sensitive  volume.)  A current  dipole was made 
from two insulated  copper wires, twisted  together,  and separated  such 
that the two uninsulated  ends were approximately  positioned  1 cm apart 
in the saline solution.  When driven, the potential  diﬀerence  between  the 
two ends of the dipole causes an ionic current  to ﬂow through  the saline, 
which mimics  a biological  current  dipole. The dipole was driven using a 
7-Hz sinusoidal  waveform  produced  by a signal generator,  with ampli- 
tude 2 V. Currents  were attenuated  by a 10-k Ωresistor  wired in series, 
to give a dipole strength  of approximately  2 𝜇Am. 
Four triaxial  OPMs were used to measure  magnetic  ﬁelds from the 
dipole. 5 s of data were recorded  at a sample rate of 1,200 Hz. This ex- 
periment  was repeated  8 times with 3 of the OPMs in diﬀerent  positions  
on each repeat (1 OPM stayed in the same position  for all 8 runs). Data 
were temporally  realigned  to form a single dataset,  giving the impres-  
sion of a single run with 25 OPMs spaced evenly around the phantom  
surface.  
Data were processed  using a bespoke  dipole ﬁtting algorithm  writ- 
ten in Matlab.  First, data were extracted  at a single point in time cor- 
responding  to either a peak or trough in the sinusoidally-modulating  
dipole current.  This resulted  in 75 ﬁeld measurements  (i.e. 25 slots, each 
with three axes of measurement).  A point dipole model ( Sarvas, 1987 ) 
was used to simulate  the expected  ﬁelds. The modelled  dipole was al- 
lowed to shift in location  and orientation  (the latter was constrained  
to be tangential)  until the correlation  between  the measured  data and 
the modelled  data was maximised.  This dipole ﬁtting process  was re- 
peated for all of the peaks and troughs  in the signal to get a cloud of 
ﬁtted dipole locations.  We noted the ﬁtted dipole position  and com- 
pared it to the “true ”dipole  location,  which was estimated  using a 3D 
digitiser.  Speciﬁcally,  the phantom  was deconstructed  and the location  
of the dipole inside mapped  using a Polhemus  digitiser  (relative  to the 
phantom  surface and OPM locations/orientations).  The locations  of the 
cloud of points representing  the dipole location  were averaged  to ﬁnd 
a single location  representing  the centre of mass. Localisation  error was 
taken as the Euclidean  distance  between  the (Polhemus-derived)  cen- 
tre of mass and the ﬁtted dipole location.  Correlation  values between  
the simulated  ﬁeld (from the ﬁtted dipole location/orientation)  and the 
measured  ﬁelds then provided  a useful quantiﬁcation  of the extent to 
which the triaxial  OPM oﬀers a true record of 3D ﬁeld distribution.  This 
process  was repeated  four times: using all three axes of every sensor (tri- 
axial measurement),  using just the radial and polar axes (dual axis 1), 
using just the radial and azimuthal  axes (dual axis 2) and using radial 
ﬁelds only (single axis).

tromagnetic  brain source localization  algorithms  which are solutions  
to the ill-posed  biomagnetic  inverse  problem.  Many inverse  algorithms  
have been proposed  for solving  the bioelectromagnetic  inverse  prob- 
lem, i.e., for estimating  the parameters  of neural source activity  from 
MEG and EEG sensor data, including  linear ( van Drongelen  et al., 1996; 
Gross et al., 2003; Hämäläinen  and Ilmoniemi,  1994; Schmidt,  1986; 
Stoica and Nehorai,  1990; Van Veen et al., 1997 ) and non-linear  meth- 
ods ( Friston et al., 2008; Gramfort  et al., 2013; Wipf et al., 2010a ), dis- 
tributed  ( Pascual-Marqui,  2002 ) vs sparse ( Gramfort  et al., 2013; Wipf 
et al., 2010a ). 
In functional  neuroimaging  studies,  two distinct  types of neural 
source activity  have been examined  – phase-locked  and non-phase  
locked event-related  brain activity.  Phase-locked  activity  is usually  ob- 
tained in evoked-response  paradigms  by averaging  activity  across re- 
peated events. Many algorithms  have been proposed  in the literature  
for examining  phase-locked  activity  ( Gramfort  et al., 2013; Hämäläi-  
nen and Ilmoniemi,  1994; Pascual-Marqui,  2002; Uutela et al., 1999; 
Wipf et al., 2010a ). A key feature contributing  to accurate  estimation  
of phase-locked  activity  is that the power of phase-locked  activity  fol- 
lowing an event is greater than a pre-event  baseline  period, and this 
activity  is dominated  by low frequencies  (1–8 Hz). In contrast,  non- 
phase locked activity  is reconstructed  by extracting  signal magnitude  
(and phase) in single trials. Importantly,  such event-related  power ﬂuc- 
tuations  can manifest  as either an increase  or a decrease  in power. 
Furthermore,  power increases  and decreases  will be frequency-speciﬁc.  
There have been only a few papers that have described  algorithms  for 
accurate  reconstructions  of time-window  and frequency  speciﬁc  event- 
related non-phase  locked brain activity  ( Dalal et al., 2008a; Gross et al., 
2001; Limpiti  et al., 2008 ). 
In our previous  work, we proposed  an adaptive  optimised  time fre- 
quency  Beamformer  (TFBF) which enables  accurate  reconstruction  of 
ﬁve-dimensional  event-related  non-phase  locked brain activity  by using 
segmented  ﬁltered  data to obtain the weight matrix and is able to esti- 
mate the change in power from a control (i.e., baseline)  time window  to 
an active time window  ( Dalal et al., 2008a ). However,  the method  suf- 
fers from sensitivity  to inaccurate  sample data covariance  matrices  that 
are used to obtain the weight matrix,  especially  under high correlated  
brain sources  or limited time series data availability  and low signal-to-  
noise ratio (SNR), for example,  in cognitive  paradigms.  Although  modi- 
ﬁcations  to the Beamformer  algorithm  have been developed  to address  
the issue of correlated  source reconstruction,  they have met with vary- 
ing success  and are further limited by requiring  a-priori  information  
on source location  ( Dalal et al., 2006 ), being limited to scalar sources  
rather than vector sources  ( Brookes  et al., 2006 ), or by being limited to 
two sources  due to computation  time constraints  ( Diwakar  et al., 2010; 
2011 ). 
Recently,  for phase-locked  brain activity,  we proposed  a family of ro- 
bust empirical  Bayesian  algorithms,  e.g., Champagne  ( Cai et al., 2020; 
Hashemi  et al., 2021b; Sekihara  and Nagarajan,  2015; Wipf et al., 
2010b ) and its extensions  ( Hashemi  et al., 2021a; 2021c; Hashemi  and 
Haufe, 2018 ), which are able to reconstruct  complex  brain activity  and 
learn the noise covariance  simultaneously,  and which has been success-  
fully applied  in M/EEG  source imaging.  In this paper, we expand  this 
empirical  Bayesian  framework  for reconstruction  of event-related  non- 
phase locked time-frequency  dynamics  of regional  cortical  oscillations.  
We refer to this extension  as time-frequency  Champagne  (TFC). This 
TFC framework  enables  imaging  of ﬁve-dimensional  (space, time, and 
frequency)  event-related  brain activity  from M/EEG  data. The key idea 
here that allows for reconstructions  of event-related  activity  in both 
task and control periods  is the use of sparse Bayesian  reconstruction  
algorithms  on omnibus  data, which includes  both task and control time- 
windows  ( Robinson  and Vrba, 1999; Singh et al., 2003; Vrba and Robin- 
son, 2001 ). 
Here, we evaluate  TFC both in simulations  and on several real 
datasets,  with comparisons  to benchmark  standards  - variants  of time- 
frequency  optimized  adaptive  beamformers  (TFBF) as well as the sLORETA  algorithm.  In simulations,  we demonstrate  several advantages  
in estimating  time-frequency  cortical  oscillatory  dynamics  compared  to 
benchmarks.  With real MEG data, we demonstrate  across many datasets  
that the proposed  approach  is robust to highly correlated  brain activity  
and low SNR data, and is able to accurately  reconstruct  cortical  dynam-  
ics with data from just a few epochs.  
2. Methods  
This section ﬁrst brieﬂy introduces  the generative  model for neural 
dynamics  and the problem  of imaging  dynamics  of frequency-speciﬁc  
neural activity.  Following  this, we introduce  the time-frequency  Cham- 
pagne algorithm  (TFC) algorithm  for estimation  of neural dynamics.  Fi- 
nally, we show the relationship  of TFC to TFBF. 
2.1. The generative  model

as: 
𝒀 = 𝑳𝑺 + 𝜺 = 𝑁 ∑
𝑛 =1 𝑳 𝑛 𝑺 𝑛 + 𝜺 , (1) 
where 𝒀 = [ 𝒚 (1) , ⋯ , 𝒚 ( 𝑇 )] ∈ℝ 𝑀×𝑇 is the measured  sensor data, 𝑀is the 
number  of channels  measured,  and 𝑇 is the number  of time samples.  
𝑳 = [ 𝑳 1 , …, 𝑳 𝑁 ] ∈ℝ 𝑀×𝑑 𝑐 𝑁 is the leadﬁeld  matrix obtained  from the 
forward  model, and 𝑑 𝑐 𝑁 = 𝑑 𝑐 ×𝑁, which we assume  to have 𝑑 𝑐 orienta-  
tions for each voxel. 𝑺 = [ 𝑺 ⊤
1 , …, 𝑺 ⊤
𝑁 ] ⊤∈ℝ 𝑑 𝑐 𝑁×𝑇 is the unknown  brain 
activity.  𝑺 𝑛 = [ 𝒔 1 
𝑛 , ⋯ , 𝒔 𝑑 𝑐 
𝑛 ] ⊤∈ℝ 𝑑 𝑐 ×𝑇 is the 𝑛 -th voxel intensity.  𝑁denotes  
the number  of voxels under consideration  and 𝑳 𝑛 = [ 𝒍 1 
𝑛 , ⋯ , 𝒍 𝑑 𝑐 
𝑛 ] ∈ℝ 𝑀×𝑑 𝑐 
denotes  the leadﬁeld  matrix for the 𝑛 -th voxel. The 𝑖 -th column  of 𝑳 𝑛 
represents  the signal vector that would be observed  at the scalp given a 
unit current  source or dipole at the 𝑛 -th voxel with a ﬁxed orientation  in 
the 𝑖 -th direction.  The voxel dimension  𝑑 𝑐 is usually  set to",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5404, 5407), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(6722, 6725), match=' 3.'>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118830,"2. Artifacts  and what’s new in dMRI preprocessing  
We will go over an extensive  list of dMRI artifacts,  focusing  on the 
preprocessing  steps needed  to address  them ( Fig. 1 ). In each section,  
we will provide  the reader with an introduction  to the artifact  and 
a summary  of pre-HCP  techniques,  as well as a description  of more 
recent post-HCP  preprocessing  strategies  and tools, and some practi- 
cal considerations  including  quality control and generalizability.  As 
part of this review,  we have collected  and classiﬁed  a list of refer- 
ences related to dMRI preprocessing,  which will be made public for 
the community  to contribute  to. As such, we endeavour  to facilitate  the 
navigation  through  the breadth  of tools and software  packages  avail- 
able, as well as keeping  an up-to-date  overview  of dMRI preprocessing  
developments  (temporary  link: https://github.com/dmripreprocessing/  
neuroimage-  review-  2022 ). The reader should note that the order of the 
preprocessing  steps listed below does not necessarily  reﬂect an optimal  
or suggested  pipeline  and diﬀerent  preprocessing  packages  indeed apply 
several of these steps at diﬀerent  stages during their execution.  Where 
appropriate,  we discuss some practical  considerations  regarding  the or- 
dering of steps. In addition,  where steps are interlinked,  we refer to the 
relevant  section.  
2.1. Brain/skull  extraction  
Description  and Importance  : 
2  C.M.W. Tax, M. Bastiani, J. Veraart et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118830 
Diﬀusion  MR images of the head contain  not only the brain (here as- 
sumed to be the organ of interest),  but also other structures  such as the 
skin, skull, eyes, meninges,  cranial nerves and face muscles.  Brain ex- 
traction  algorithms  allow the removal  of these structures  from the data 
to potentially  improve  the reliability  of further preprocessing  steps, such 
as tissue segmentation  or cross-modal  registration,  in addition  to reduc- 
ing the computational  demands  of any subsequent  analyses  as these can 
be constrained  to the voxels of interest.  For example,  using an imperfect  
mask can lead to the inclusion  of voxels with spuriously  high fractional  
anisotropy  (FA) at the periphery  of the brain, which might bias further 
registration  or analysis  steps. 
Approaches  prior to and brought  by the HCP : 
Brain extraction  in dMRI can take advantage  of the skull, fat and 
muscle tissue having considerably  lower signal intensity  than the brain 
in fat-suppressed  EPI acquisitions.  Therefore,  the problem  can be for- 
mulated  as a standard  image processing  background/foreground  seg- 
mentation.  The well-known  Otsu histogram  thresholding  technique  
( Otsu, 1979 ) can be retroﬁtted  to this problem  to ﬁnd the optimal  sig- 
nal threshold  that separates  the brain from non-brain  regions  and is the 
brain extraction  algorithm  of choice in multiple  preprocessing  pipelines  
( Garyfallidis  et al., 2014 ). 
Another  popular  technique,  FSL’s Brain Extraction  Tool (BET) 
( Smith, 2002 ), is widely used across diﬀerent  imaging  modalities,  in- 
cluding  dMRI. BET makes mild assumptions  about the shape of the 
brain and it radially  projects  beams from an initial center position  onto 
a small centered  spherical  mesh, until the beams reach large intensity  
gradients.  The slowly growing  mesh is updated  iteratively  to accom-  
modate  the shape of the brain. A similar approach.  AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip  
( Cox, 1996 ) ﬁrst removes  gross spatial image nonuniformities  and repo- 
sitions the brain to a more convenient  orientation  and subsequently  ap- 
plies a modiﬁed  version  of BET for brain extraction.  For dMRI datasets,  
these methods  are most typically  performed  on the ﬁrst non-diﬀusion-  
weighted  𝑏 = 0 𝑠 ∕ 𝑚𝑚 2 image (referred  as the 𝑏 = 0 image throughout  
this manuscript).  
Another  category  of brain extraction  techniques  nonlinearly  register  
the 𝑏 = 0 image to one or multiple  brain templates  (or vice versa) for 
which segmentation  or tissue probability  maps have been pre-generated.  
These template-based  brain extraction  methods  subsequently  perform  a 
voting procedure  that decides  whether  a voxel belongs  to the foreground  
or background.  BEaST ( Eskildsen  et al., 2012 ) and ALFA ( Serag et al., 
2016 ) are examples  that use multiple  templates  to statistically  improve  
the voting process.  
Diﬀusion  MRI-speciﬁc  methods  leverage  the properties  of the dMRI 
signal by ﬁtting a diﬀusion  model to the data and using the derived  
measures  for brain extraction.  One of the ﬁrst measures  adopted  in 
this context  is Quantitative  Anisotropy  proposed  for Generalized  Q- 
Sampling  Imaging  (GQI) ( Yeh et al., 2010 ) but can be generalized  to 
any model computing  orientation  distribution  functions  (ODF) (e.g. DSI 
( Wedeen  et al., 2005 )). The properties  of quantitative  anisotropy  in the 
brain and the background  regions  are suﬃciently  diﬀerent  that a single 
threshold  is often adequate  to remove  the nonbrain  areas. 
Novel strategies  : 
Diﬀerent  types of deep learning  architectures  such as convolution  
neural networks  (CNNs)  ( Kleesiek  et al., 2016 ) or U-Nets ( Wang et al., 
2020b ) have recently  been proposed  for brain extraction.  In addition  
to deep learning-based  segmentation,  traditional  machine  learning  clas- 
siﬁers such as random  forests have been used to segment  dMRI data 
into intracranial,  brain, and cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF) masks ( Reid et al., 
2018 ). 
Practical  considerations  : 
Brain extraction  quite commonly  requires  user intervention  in the 
form of 𝑏 = 0 image selection,  quality checking,  and/or parameter  opti- 
mization.  Brain extraction  is typically  performed  on the ﬁrst 𝑏 = 0 im- 
age, however,  any artifacts  deteriorating  its quality will also impact its 
performance.  Since such a reference  image is often used for multiple  
preprocessing  steps (e.g. motion correction,  see Section  2.8 ) it is good practice  to select images with minimal  artifacts  for brain extraction  ei- 
ther manually  or automatically  ( Bastiani  et al., 2019b ). However,  even 
with adequate  data the extraction  algorithm  can generate  unsatisfac-  
tory results (e.g. in the case of low signal intensities),  and therefore  the 
quality of the extracted  brain masks should be checked.  Several  brain 
extraction  algorithms  are designed  for in vivo human brain data and are 
not directly  applicable  to other organs or species and/or require  exten- 
sive parameter  tuning.  
The Otsu technique  assumes  a bimodal  signal distribution  and can be 
sensitive  to noise in the data. It is therefore  commonly  performed  after 
the application  of a median  ﬁlter which removes  spurious  intensities  
( Garyfallidis  et al., 2014 ) to increase  its accuracy.  As it does not rely 
on a priori brain shape information,  it can more readily be applied  to 
brains of other species.  In contrast,  FSL’s BET and AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip  
(in its default setting),  have a priori assumptions  on the brain shape and 
can not directly  be applied  to other organs or species.  Additionally,  the 
performance  of BET relies on the accuracy  of the center estimation  and 
the validity  of its uniform  intensity  assumption.  
The registration  quality of the brain outline in template-based  ex- 
traction  methods  is of fundamental  importance  for its accuracy.  The 
machine  learning  methods  depend  quite strongly  on the size and the 
representation  power of the training  dataset.  Accurate  segmentation  is 
further challenged  by pathology  in clinical  datasets,  for example  in trau- 
matic brain injury (TBI) patients  (see Lutkenhoﬀet  al. (2014) ). 
Brain extraction  is generally  performed  early in the pipeline  as other 
steps can require  a mask (e.g. signal drift correction  ( Section  2.3 ) and 
motion/eddy  current  correction  ( Sections  2.7 and 2.9 )). However,  com- 
putation  of a brain mask prior to susceptibility  distortion  correction  
( Section  2.11 ) can lead to inaccurate  results,  as signal pile-up and signal- 
reduction  can confuse  brain extraction  approaches.  In addition,  the 
mask will suﬀer from the same geometric  distortions  as the uncorrected  
𝑏 = 0 image, which for example  complicates  registration  to anatomi-  
cal T1 weighted  images.  Furthermore,  brain extraction  prior to motion 
correction  and eddy current  distortion  correction  may lead to subopti-  
mal masking  of diﬀusion-weighted  images (DWIs) as they are aﬀected  
by translations/rotations  and geometrical  distortions  compared  to the 
ﬁrst 𝑏 = 0 image. Therefore,  brain extraction  can be performed  at mul- 
tiple stages in the pipeline,  and it is good practice  to compute  an up- 
dated mask after preprocessing  and prior to further analysis  steps such 
as model ﬁtting, spatial normalization,  and registration  to anatomical  
images.  
2.2. B-Matrix  incompatibility  with the imaging  data 
Description  and Importance  : The B-matrix  ( Mattiello  et al., 1997 ) or 
B-tensor  contains  information  on the diﬀusion  encoding  - i.e., the dif- 
fusion gradient  orientation  and strength  - associated  to a dMRI volume,  
which is necessary  for the estimation  of diﬀusion  models and represen-  
tations.  Depending  on the scanner  manufacturer,  model, and software  
version,  the diﬀusion  encoding  information  may be stored in the DI- 
COM headers  in the form of either a 𝑏 -value/  𝑏 -vector pair (which can 
be used to compute  the B-matrix  of Stejskal-Tanner  acquisitions,  Fig. 2 ), 
or the B-matrix  itself (which can be decomposed  into 𝑏 -values/  𝑏 -vectors  
through  singular  value decomposition  and can also accommodate  more 
general  encodings,  see Section  5.3 ). The 𝑏 -values contain  information  
about the magnitude  and timing of the diﬀusion  gradients  and the 𝑏 - 
vectors  about their orientation.  Depending  on the scanner,  the B-matrix  
can also include  the information  of the eﬀects of imaging  gradients  on 
diﬀusion  sensitization  ( Lundell  et al., 2014; Mattiello  et al., 1997 ). 
Diﬀerent  scanner  manufacturers  and software  versions  can save the 
B-matrix  in diﬀerent  ways, e.g. ﬂips in directions  ( Fig. 2 a)) or permu-  
tation in axes ( Fig. 2 b)). This can result in a mismatch  between  the 
coordinate  systems  of the B-matrix  and imaging  data. Furthermore,  per- 
mutations  and ﬂips can occur during conversion  between  ﬁle formats  or 
between  diﬀerent  software  packages.

Fig. 2. B-matrix  incompatibilities.  Left: example  notations  used for the gradient  direction,  B-matrix,  b-value,  and diﬀusion  tensor, where capital letters denote 
tensors and lower case letters their vectorized  form. Tr() denotes the trace. The computation  of the B-matrix  from the gradient  directions  (stored in the. bvec ﬁle) 
and b-values  (stored in the.bval  ﬁle) in the case of conventional  Stejskal-Tanner  or linear tensor encoding  (LTE) is shown. a) The ﬁrst eigenvector  of the DT (sagittal  
and coronal view) and resulting  tractography  (coronal  anterior  view) is shown for y- and z-gradient  direction  sign ﬂips; here the x-, y-, and z-axes correspond  to 
left-right,  anterior-posterior,  and inferior-superior  axes, respectively.  Note that these ﬂips cannot be identiﬁed  on the FA or color-FA  maps (where the RGB color 
reﬂects the direction  of the DT ﬁrst eigenvector).  b) Gradient  axes permutations,  these become apparent  on the color-FA  maps. 
B-matrix  incompatibilities  with the imaging  data are particularly  
problematic  for rotational  variance  analyses  such as ﬁber tractography.  
This issue might go unnoticed  in dMRI studies,  e.g. when solely analyz-  
ing dMRI-derived  rotationally  invariant  scalar maps such as FA. 
Approaches  prior to and brought  by the HCP : Manually  inspecting  the 
diﬀusion  tensor (DT) ﬁrst eigenvectors  can reveal axes permutations  
and gradient  ﬂips ( Fig. 2 right), but it is not always straightforward  
to ﬁnd the appropriate  correction  and trial-and-error  of the ﬁnite set 
of possibilities  may be necessary.  Automated  solutions  have been pro- 
posed that check for unintended  B-matrix  incompatibilities  and cor- 
rect the B-matrix  to match the coordinate  space of the imaging  data. 
Jeurissen  et al. (2014) introduced  the average  trajectory  length as a mea- 
sure of how well the gradient  orientations  match the diﬀusion  MRI im- 
ages. This strategy  relies on the assumption  that wrongly  permuting  axes 
or ﬂipping  gradient  orientations  will reduce the length of most anatom-  
ically correct trajectories  and therefore  reduce the average  length, al- 
though it may result in a few slightly  longer spurious  streamlines.  A 
similar approach  is used by AFNI ( Cox, 1996 ) using the GradFlipTest  
command  ( Taylor et al., 2018 ), and other tools provide  similar utili- 
ties including  functions  for performing  fast tracking  and calculating  the 
length of tracks. 
Novel strategies  : Recently  a new approach  was proposed  by 
Schilling  et al. (2019b)  based on a ”ﬁber coherence  index ”, which quan- 
tiﬁes the number  of pairs of neighboring  ﬁber orientations  that are co- 
herent, weighted  by their anisotropy  values. The coherence  index is 
based on the assumption  that white matter orientation  is coherent  on 
the millimeter  scale throughout  the brain, and that the correct gradient  
table results in the highest  overall coherence.  This approach  showed  
good performance  both in healthy  subjects  and in patients,  and in in 
vivo and ex vivo animal data. Practical  considerations  : The proposed  methods  are generally  fast 
with few parameters,  making  them suitable  for use across species and 
in vivo and ex vivo data. Some B-matrix  inconsistencies  are diﬃcult  
to recognize,  for example  a ﬂip in the left-right  direction  on a coro- 
nal plane or when permutations  and ﬂips occur along multiple  axes. In 
these cases, further manual  QC may be required,  i.e. looking  for speciﬁc  
known pathways  such as the Corpus Callosum  (CC), cortico-spinal  tract 
(CST) and arcuate  fasciculus  (AF). Finally,  other artifacts  may hamper  
the automatic  detection  of B-matrix  inconsistencies,  e.g. severe motion 
or signal dropouts  ( Schilling  et al., 2019b ). B-matrix  checks are typically  
performed  early in the pipeline,  as quality checks (e.g. based on color- 
coded FA images)  and steps relying on rotationally  variant information  
are aﬀected  by incompatibilities.

To identify  areas of activation  due to each task, a t -test is then performed  
at each location,  which requires  correcting  for the massive  number  of 
multiple  comparisons  this involves.  This correction,  combined  with fail- 
ure to fully leverage  information  shared across brain locations,  often 
results in a lack of power to detect many true activations  at the group 
level for small sample sizes (e.g., 𝑛 = 20 to 30), and even more so in 
individual  subjects  ( Cremers  et al., 2017; Lindquist  and Mejia, 2015 ). 
While group-level  discoveries  using task fMRI have greatly advanced  
general  understanding  of brain function  and organization,  as well as sys- 
tematic  diﬀerences  related to disease,  condition,  and normal  develop-  
ment and aging, individual-level  measures  are vital for advancing  fMRI- 
based research  to new frontiers.  Longitudinal  modeling,  biomarker  dis- 
covery,  therapeutic  clinical  trials, translation  of research  ﬁndings  into 
clinical  practice,  and pre-surgical  planning  all depend  on extracting  ac- 
curate measures  of brain function  and organization  in individual  sub- 
jects, often without  the luxury of long or multiple  sessions  of data. 
Therefore,  it is vital to develop  more powerful  and accurate  methods.  A 
promising  direction  is to incorporate  expected  patterns  of spatial depen- 
dence and sparsity  in activation  amplitude  ( Zhang et al., 2015 ) through  
spatial Bayesian  models.  Several  such models have been proposed  for 
volumetric  (typically  slice-wise)  analysis  ( Spencer  et al., 2020; Zhang 
et al., 2015; 2016; 2014 ). Yet there is growing  evidence  in favor of 
surface-based  analyses  to improve  sensitivity,  power and reproducibility  
( Anticevic  et al., 2008; Brodoehl  et al., 2020; Fischl et al., 1999; Glasser  
et al., 2013; Tucholka  et al., 2012 ). Importantly,  surface-based  analy- 
sis avoids spurious  activations  induced  by mixing signals across distinct  
cortical  areas ( Brodoehl  et al., 2020; Glasser  et al., 2013 ), which can oc- 
cur in standard  volumetric  smoothing  as well as spatial Bayesian  models 
applied  to volumetric  data, since they implicitly  smooth  activations.  
Recently,  Mejia et al. (2020b)  proposed  a novel surface-based  spa- 
tial Bayesian  GLM, which combines  the beneﬁts  of spatial modeling  and 
the advantages  of cortical  surface analysis.  In this framework,  activation  
amplitudes  are based on the mean of the posterior  distribution  for each 
task, which incorporates  spatial dependence  and sparsity  from the prior, 
yielding  more focal regions  of peak activation.  Areas of activation  are 
identiﬁed  using the joint posterior  distribution  through  an excursions  
set approach  ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2015 ), avoiding  the need for multi- 
ple comparisons  correction  and greatly increasing  power. Group eﬀects 
can be estimated  through  a computationally  eﬃcient  approach  based on 
combining  the results of each subject-level  model in a principled  way. 
The Bayesian  computation  is performed  using integrated  nested Laplace  
approximations  (INLA) ( Rue et al., 2009 ), which is computationally  ef- 
ﬁcient and does not suﬀer from the inaccuracies  common  to variational  
Bayesian  approaches  ( Sidén et al., 2017 ), which have been commonly  
used in volumetric  spatial Bayesian  analyses.  
This approach  was validated  by Mejia et al. (2020b)  through  simu- 
lation studies and a study of twenty individuals  from the Human  Con- 
nectome  Project (HCP) ( Barch et al., 2013 ). These analyses  showed  a 
major improvement  to estimation  eﬃciency  and power, relative  to the 
classical  massive  univariate  GLM. However,  this approach  has not yet 
been fully validated  with real data, and how accurately  it estimates  brain 
function  and organization  reﬂecting  individualized  functional  topology  
remains  to be determined.  In this paper, we extensively  validate  the 
surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM framework  in terms of reliability  
and power. We do not perform  a simulation  studies here, as extensive  
simulations  were performed  within Mejia et al. (2020b)  , showing  im- 
provements  in the accuracy  and power of the spatial Bayesian  GLM for 
both subject-level  and group analysis.  We illustrate  the gain in power 
and statistical  eﬃciency  of the Bayesian  approach  for both subject-level  
and group-level  analyses,  particularly  for shorter scan durations.  To as- 
sess the ability of the Bayesian  approach  to extract unique individual-  
level insights,  we examine  the reliability  of the Bayesian  estimates  and 
areas of activation.  
We also extend the original  model proposed  by 
Mejia et al. (2020b)  in two important  ways. First, in the original  
model, the spherical  surfaces  from each subject were used as the spatial domain.  Inﬂation  to the sphere,  while useful for inter-subject  registra-  
tion, distorts  the distances  between  neighboring  vertices  up to 3-fold 
( Appendix  Fig. A.1 ). This has implications  for the smoothing  of task 
activations  performed  implicitly  in the Bayesian  model, because  the 
degree of dependence  between  neighbors  is a function  of the distance  
between  them. In this work, we use the midthickness  surface of each 
individual  subject having been registered  to the fsaverage32k  template,  
which was created  using the FreeSurfer  software  platform  ( Fischl, 2012 ) 
and is freely available  in the HCP data release ( Barch et al., 2013 ). 
This surface geometry  respects  the individual  anatomical  features  of 
each individual  subject and preserves  the geodesic  distances  between  
locations  along the cortical  surface,  while aligning  vertices  across 
subjects  for possible  group-level  analysis.  
Second,  the original  model was proposed  for single-subject,  single- 
run analysis  (with group-level  analysis  possible  through  a principled  
post-hoc  approach).  Here, we generalize  the model to multi-run  analy- 
sis. In this framework,  separate  run-speciﬁc  estimates  and areas of acti- 
vation are produced,  along with cross-run  averages.  A major advantage  
of the multi-run  model is that hyperparameters  controlling  the spatial 
properties  of each task activation  ﬁeld are shared across runs, improving  
estimation  eﬃciency.  
The remainder  of this paper is organized  as follows.  The 2 sec- 
tion will outline the surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM and the clas- 
sical GLM, and will also include  a description  of the data, the model 
estimation  procedure,  and the reliability  metrics.  Section  3 will outline 
the application  and results of analyses  of the motor task data from the 
Human  Connectome  Project ( Barch et al., 2013 ) using the classical  and 
Bayesian  GLMs. Section  4 will summarize  the ﬁndings.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM 
The subject-level  surface-based  spatial Bayesian  (SBSB) GLM pro- 
posed by Mejia et al. (2020b)  consists  of two stages: model estimation  
and identifying  areas of activation.  Fig. 1 illustrates  both stages in con- 
trast with the classical  GLM. Below, we describe  each stage brieﬂy,  in- 
cluding  our novel multi-run  extension.  The SBSB GLM also allows for 
computationally  eﬃcient  group-level  estimation,  described  below. For 
more details on the mathematical  construction  and Bayesian  compu-  
tation of the SBSB model, see Mejia et al. (2020b)  . The Bernstein-von  
Mises theorem,  which gives asymptotic  guarantees  concerning  conver-  
gence for Bayesian  models,  holds in the Bayesian  implementation  of the 
model as long as regularity  conditions  about the mean are met and the 
model itself is not misspeciﬁed  ( Van der Vaart, 2000 ). The INLA ap- 
proach centers the posterior  around the maximum  likelihood  estimator  
with covariance  equal to the inverse  Fisher information  matrix using a 
normal  prior distribution  as the sample size approaches  inﬁnity.  This 
satisﬁes  the regularity  conditions  imposed  by the Bernstein-von  Mises 
Theorem  because  the density  function  is continuous  and twice diﬀeren-  
tiable everywhere.  Please see Van der Vaart (2000) for further details 
about the conditions  of the Bernstein-von  Mises theorem.  
2.1.1. Single-subject  modeling  
Single-run  model.  Let 𝑁be the number  of vertices  on the cortical  
surface where BOLD signal is measured,  and let 𝑇 be the duration  of the 
fMRI timeseries.  The classical  GLM ( Friston et al., 1995 ) adapted  to the 
cortical  surface is based on ﬁtting a separate  regression  model at each 
vertex. In each model, the response  is the observed  BOLD activity,  and 
the predictors  are the expected  BOLD response  due to each of 𝐾tasks 
or stimuli,  which is constructed  by convolving  the timeseries  of stim- 
ulus presentation  with a haemodynamic  response  function  (HRF). For 
simplicity,  assume  that nuisance  signals (e.g. head motion parameters,  
drift) have been regressed  from both the response  and task predictors,  
and assume  that the data has been prewhitened  to remove  temporal

Fig. 1. The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM compared  with the classical  GLM. Both GLMs consist of two stages: (1) estimating  activation  amplitude  and (2) 
identifying  areas of activation.  At stage 1, the Bayesian  GLM incorporates  spatial dependence  and performs  shrinkage  of background  locations  through  a prior on 
𝜷, resulting  in smoother  and more reliable estimates  of activation,  given by the maximum-a-posteriori  (MAP) value from the posterior  distribution  of 𝜷. At stage 2, 
the Bayesian  GLM identiﬁes  the collection  of vertices with activation  amplitude  above a speciﬁed  eﬀect size, based on joint posterior  probabilities.  This results in 
greater power to detect true activations.  
autocorrelation  in the model residuals  and to eliminate  spatial hetero- 
geneity  in the residual  variance.  Then, the classical  GLM at vertex 𝑣 can 
be represented  as 
𝐲 𝑣 = 𝐗 𝑣 𝜷𝑣 + 𝝐𝑣 , (1) 
where 𝐲 𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝑇 is the observed  BOLD timeseries,  𝐗 𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝑇×𝐾 contains  the 
expected  response  to each of the 𝐾stimuli,  𝜷𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝐾 are the coeﬃcient  
values representing  the activation  amplitude  for each stimulus  at a sin- 
gle vertex 𝑣 , and 𝝐𝑣 𝑖𝑛𝑑 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑇 ) are white-noise  residuals.  Note 
that 𝐗 𝑣 may vary across vertices  due to prewhitening,  which involves  
pre-multiplying  the original  design matrix by a vertex-speciﬁc  whiten-  
ing matrix.  If no prewhitening  is performed,  then 𝐗 1 = ⋯ = 𝐗 𝑁 . While 
computationally  convenient  and simple,  ﬁtting thousands  of separate  
models is clearly suboptimal,  since neighboring  vertices  are known to 
exhibit similar patterns  of task activation.  If these similarities  are not 
explicitly  modeled,  the estimates  of activation  will contain  high levels 
of noise due to reduced  statistical  eﬃciency.  
A spatial Bayesian  GLM addresses  this by treating  the image of ac- 
tivation  amplitudes  in response  to task 𝑘 , 𝜷𝑘 = ( 𝛽1 𝑘 , …, 𝛽𝑁𝑘 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁 , as 
a latent ﬁeld across the 𝑁data locations,  and assuming  a spatial prior 
to incorporate  prior knowledge  of local spatial dependence  and spar- 
sity ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM pro- 
posed by Mejia et al. (2020b)  makes use of a particular  class of Gaussian  
Markov  Random  Field (GMRF)  priors called stochastic  partial diﬀeren-  
tial equation  (SPDE) priors, which approximate  a continuous  Matérn  
random  ﬁeld by a GMRF ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2013; Lindgren  et al., 
2011 ). SPDE priors are particularly  well-suited  to model cs-fMRI  data 
for several reasons:  they have sparse precision  (required  for high di- mensional  contexts),  they are built on a triangular  mesh (the format of 
cs-fMRI  data, see Appendix  Fig. A.2 ), they have two separate  parame-  
ters to control the scale and the smoothness,  they are invariant  to ﬁnite 
resamplings,  and the parameters  are interpretable  given the relation-  
ship with the Matérn  covariance  function.  The SPDE prior in ℝ 𝑑 uses 
the Matérn  kernel to inform the spatial covariance  for the latent ﬁeld of 
task coeﬃcients.  The Matérn  covariance  for a pair of vertices  𝐮 and 𝐯 is 
a function  of their distance  ||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||, and is explicitly  deﬁned  as: 
cov ( 𝐮 , 𝐯 ) = 𝜎2 ( 𝜅||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||) 𝐾 1 ( 𝜅||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||) , 
where 𝜎2 > 0 is the variance  and 𝐾 1 ( ⋅) is the modiﬁed  Bessel function  
of the second kind of order 1, which decreases  rapidly  as the distance  
between  two vertices  increases.  Performing  all of the distance  calcula-  
tions for large datasets  is computationally  infeasible,  as the covariance  
matrix is dense and diﬃcult  to invert. Lindgren  et al. (2011) solved this 
problem  by deriving  an explicit  GMRF representation  through  solving  
the SPDE 
( 𝜅2 − Δ) 𝛼∕2 ( 𝜏𝛽( 𝐮 )) = ( 𝐮 ) , 𝐮 ∈ℝ 𝑑 , 
where Δ= ∑𝑑 
𝑖 =1 𝜕 2 ∕ 𝜕𝑢 2 
𝑖 is the Laplacian  operator,  𝛼aﬀects the smooth-  
ness, and 𝜏aﬀects the variance.  In order to obtain a Markov  struc- 
ture, we approximate  using the basis expansion  𝛽( 𝐮 ) ≈∑𝑛 
𝑖 =1 𝜓 𝑖 ( 𝐮 ) 𝑤 𝑖 (see 
Mejia et al. (2020b)  for further details).  It is important  to note that 
||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||represents  the geodesic  distance  between  vertices  𝐮 and 𝐯 , and 
not the Euclidean  distance.  The geodesic  distances  are found using the 
subject-speciﬁc  cortical  surfaces  and takes the folded geometry  of the 
cortex into account  to ﬁnd the distance  along the surface.  An SPDE prior

for a given Gaussian  process  𝜷takes the form 
𝜷= 𝚿𝐰 , 𝐰 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅,𝜏) , (2) 
𝐐 𝜅,𝜏= 𝜏2 ( 𝜅4 𝐂 + 2 𝜅2 𝐆 + 𝐆𝐂 −1 𝐆 ) , (3) 
where 𝚿is an 𝑁 ×𝑛 indicator  matrix in which element  𝜓 𝑖,𝑗 = 1 when 
data location  𝑖 corresponds  to vertex 𝑗, and 0 for all 𝜓 𝑖,𝑗 ′, where 𝑗 ≠𝑗 ′. 
Often, 𝚿is an identity  matrix because  cortical  surface data locations  
are already  on a mesh. However,  in some cases, the mesh may contain  
additional  locations  to satisfy shape and size constraints  and boundary  
locations  to improve  estimation  along the data boundary.  In our study, 
the cortical  surface geometry  is stored in the form of a triangular  mesh, 
and so a mesh does not need to be constructed.  However,  in the case 
when no cortical  surface geometry  is available,  an automated  procedure  
to construct  a mesh on ℝ , ℝ 2 , or a sphere is implemented  in the R-INLA  
package  Martins  et al. (2013) , which maximizes  the minimum  interior  
angle of the mesh triangles  to make transitions  between  small and large 
triangles  as smooth  as possible.  Please see Mejia et al. (2020b)  for fur- 
ther details on the construction  of the mesh and 𝚿. In the SBSB GLM, 
additional  mesh locations  consist of the medial wall, which serves as a 
supplemental  layer to improve  estimation  along the data boundary.  The 
matrix 𝐐 𝜅,𝜏is a sparse precision  (inverse  covariance)  matrix with a ﬁxed 
set of non-zero  elements  whose value are determined  by 𝜅and 𝜏. The 
smoothness  of the latent ﬁeld is controlled  by the 𝜅parameter,  which 
controls  how much distance  dependence  there should be in the ﬁeld. A 
larger value for 𝜅corresponds  to a “smoother  ”latent  ﬁeld with a larger 
range of spatial dependence.  The precision  parameter  𝜏determines  the 
level of precision  in the latent ﬁeld such that lower values correspond  to 
lower precision  values (higher  variance)  in the prior. The matrix 𝐆 is a 
sparse, symmetric  adjacency  matrix in which non-zero  entries exist only 
on the diagonal  and in cells corresponding  to neighboring  locations,  and 
𝐂 is a diagonal  matrix ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2013 ). 
The single-run  SBSB GLM assumes  independent  SPDE priors on 
each of the 𝐾latent ﬁelds. Let 𝐲 = ( 𝐲 ′
1 , …, 𝐲 ′
𝑁 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁𝑇×1 , let 
𝐗 = block-diagonal  ( 𝐗 1 , …, 𝐗 𝑁 ) ∈ℝ 𝑁 𝑇×𝑁 𝐾 , and let 𝜷= ( 𝜷′
1 , …, 𝜷′
𝑁 ) ′∈
ℝ 𝑁×𝐾 . The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM is given by 
𝐲|𝜷= 𝐗 𝜷+ 𝐞 , 𝐞 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑁𝑇 ) 
𝜷𝑘 = 𝚿𝐰 𝑘 , 𝐰 𝑘 |𝜅𝑘 , 𝜏𝑘 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅𝑘 ,𝜏𝑘 ) , 𝑘 = 1 , …, 𝐾 
𝜽= ( 𝜅1 , 𝜏1 , …, 𝜅𝐾 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝜎2 ) ∼𝜋( 𝜽) , (4) 
where 𝜽contains  all the model hyperparameters,  and 𝜋( 𝜽) is their joint 
prior. We adopt the default priors set by the R-INLA  framework:  In- 
dependent  log-Normal  distributions  are used for all 𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 , and a 
Gamma  distribution  is used for the precision  ( 1 
𝜎2 ). 
Multi-run  model.  If multiple  runs of task data are available  from 
a given subject,  it is beneﬁcial  to leverage  those repeated  measures  to 
more accurately  estimate  the model hyperparameters  (e.g. the parame-  
ters 𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 controlling  the spatial properties  of the activation  ampli- 
tude for each task 𝑘 , and the residual  variance  𝜎2 ). We therefore  propose  
a multi-run  spatial Bayesian  GLM to jointly model runs 𝑗 = 1 , …, 𝐽. Let 
𝐲 𝑗 , 𝐗 𝑗 , 𝜷𝑗 , 𝜷𝑗,𝑘 , and 𝐞 𝑗 be the run 𝑗-speciﬁc  quantities  in Eq. (4) . The 
multi-run  SBSB GLM can be represented  as 
𝐲 𝑗 |𝜷𝑗 = 𝐗 𝑗 𝜷𝑗 + 𝐞 𝑗 , 𝐞 𝑗 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑁𝑇 ) , 𝑗 = 1 , …, 𝐽 
𝜷𝑗,𝑘 = 𝚿𝐰 𝑗,𝑘 , 𝐰 𝑗,𝑘 |𝜅𝑘 , 𝜏𝑘 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅𝑘 ,𝜏𝑘 ) , 𝑘 = 1 , …, 𝐾 
𝜽= ( 𝜅1 , 𝜏1 , …, 𝜅𝐾 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝜎2 ) ∼𝜋( 𝜽) , (5) 
where we again assume  for simplicity  nuisance  signals have been re- 
gressed  from both the response  and task predictors,  and assume  that the 
data have been prewhitened  to remove  temporal  autocorrelation  in the 
model residuals  and to eliminate  spatial heterogeneity  in the residual  
variance.  Note that the run-speciﬁc  activation  amplitudes,  𝜷𝑗,𝑘 , are es- 
timated  individually,  while sharing  a common  prior determined  by the 
parameters  𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 . Additionally,  the between-run  average  amplitude  
can be estimated.  These provide  more statistically  eﬃcient  estimates  of 
activation  amplitudes  if diﬀerences  across runs are not of interest.  These averages  are constructed  as linear combinations  of the run-speciﬁc  la- 
tent ﬁelds, so their posterior  distribution  is available  and can be used to 
identify  areas of activation  as described  in Section  2.1.3 below. 
2.1.2. Group-level  modeling  
Previously  proposed  spatial Bayesian  GLMs for volumetric  fMRI data 
were limited to single-subject  analysis,  in large part due to the com- 
putational  burden associated  with analyzing  data from many subjects  
concurrently.  Mejia et al. (2020b)  proposed  a computationally  eﬃcient  
“joint ” group-level  modeling  approach  based on ﬁrst estimating  each 
subject-level  model separately,  and then combining  the results in a prin- 
cipled way. Here, we generalize  this approach  to any number  of runs, 
𝐽 ≥ 1 . For simplicity  of notation,  assume  that all subjects  have the same 
number  of runs 𝐽. Let 𝜷𝑚 ∈ℝ 𝐾𝐽𝑀 represent  the activation  amplitudes  
for subject 𝑚 for all tasks and all runs. The joint group-level  model- 
ing approach  is based on specifying  a group-level  contrast  matrix 𝐀 , 
so that the quantity  of interest  can be expressed  as a linear combina-  
tion of the subject-level  parameter  estimates.  𝐀 is based on a group 
contrast  vector 𝐚 ∈ℝ 𝑀𝐽𝐾 which speciﬁes  the desired  contrast  across 
subjects,  runs, and tasks. For example,  𝐚 can be constructed  to rep- 
resent the group average  activation  amplitude  in response  to a par- 
ticular task, the diﬀerence  in average  amplitude  across two groups of 
subjects  or diﬀerent  conditions,  or a contrast  across tasks. Next, the 
contrast  matrix is created  as 𝐀 = 𝐚 ′⊗𝐈 𝑁 , where ⊗represents  the Kro- 
necker product.  The group-level  eﬀect is deﬁned  as 𝜷𝐺 = 𝐀 𝜷∈ℝ 𝑁 , 
where 𝜷= ( 𝜷′
1 , …, 𝜷′
𝑀 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁𝐾𝐽𝑀 is the concatenated  activation  am- 
plitudes  across all runs, subjects,  and tasks. A speciﬁc  example  is given 
in Section  2.2.3 below. See Mejia et al. (2020b)  for details on the poste- 
rior computation  of 𝜷𝐺 . Having  obtained  its posterior  distribution,  the 
estimate  of 𝜷𝐺 is given by its posterior  mean or other summary  metric, 
and we can identify  group-level  areas of activation  as described  in the 
following  section.  
Group modeling  under the classical  GLM was carried out by averag-  
ing the estimates  of the task coeﬃcients  from each subject,  i.e. 
𝜷𝐺,𝑘 = 1 
𝑀 𝑀 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝜷𝑖,𝑘 , 
where 𝜷𝑚,𝑘 is the length 𝑁vector of coeﬃcient  estimates  for subject 𝑚 
and task 𝑘 . Since all runs across subjects  and sessions  were of the same 
length with the same repetition  time, this is equivalent  to concatenating  
the data across all runs and performing  the group classical  GLM follow- 
ing the same steps as in the single-subject  classical  GLM. Activation  was 
determined  using t-tests, as in the single-subject  classical  GLM model.

certainty,  in conjunction  with exploring  risk and ambiguity  as types of 
uncertainty.  
There are several good reasons  as to why decisions  may diﬀer be- 
tween lottery selections  and social interactive  choices.  An important  
consideration  in this regard is that losing money due to the acts of 
another  person instead  of via a random  mechanistic  device can in- 
duce strong feelings  of betrayal  aversion  ( Bohnet and Zeckhauser,  2004 ; 
Aimone  and Houser,  2012 ). Furthermore,  a decision-maker  can perceive  
either violated  trust or a norm violation  as stemming  from incorrect  
judgment  regarding  the behavior  of another  individual,  whereas  they 
are more likely to perceive  the same negative  outcome  as mere bad luck 
in a lottery domain  with a computerized  ‘partner’  ( Trautmann  et al., 
2008 ). For this reason,  decision-makers  are more inclined  to invest 
money in a lottery than an otherwise  comparable  human partner  
( Bohnet and Zeckhauser,  2004 ). 
Several  fMRI studies have focused  on types of uncertainty,  though 
not yet in conjunction  with social sources  ( Hsu et al., 2005 ; Huettel  et al., 
2006 ; Bach et al., 2009 ; 2011 ; Levy et al., 2010; Rustichini  et al., 
2005 ). These studies consistently  show evidence  of ambiguity  aversion  
in lottery contexts,  that is, a preference  for the risky option over the 
ambiguous  option, but oﬀer diﬀerent  interpretations  as to the neural 
correlates  underlying  these observed  behavioral  patterns.  One group 
has highlighted  the role of the amygdala  and the orbitofrontal  cortex 
(OFC), explaining  ambiguity  aversion  in terms of neural alertness  to 
unknown,  and potentially  dangerous,  consequences  of missing  informa-  
tion ( Hsu et al., 2005 , p.1683).  However,  an alternate  view implicates  
brain regions  such as the inferior  frontal gyrus (IFG), the posterior  pari- 
etal cortex, precuneus  and middle temporal  gyrus ( Huettel  et al., 2006 ; 
Bach et al., 2011 ), and instead  explains  ambiguity  aversion  as a complex  
expected  value calculation  where one is integrating  multiple  potential  
subjective  probability  distributions  in an eﬀort to resolve ambiguity.  
On the other hand, social uncertainty  stemming  from potential  neg- 
ative social interactions  in games such as the Trust Game, Prisoner’s  
Dilemma  Game and Ultimatum  Game have been related to activation  in 
the anterior  insula ( Bellucci  et al., 2017 ; Lauharatanahirum  et al., 2012 ; 
Aimone  et al., 2014 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Feng et al., 2015 ; Rilling et al., 
2008 ; Sanfey et al., 2003 ). This activation  is understood  to stem from 
an aversive  feeling of uncertainty  related to potential  betrayal  by, and 
a norm violation  of, a game partner.  Moreover,  the activation  in this 
region is generally  much stronger  when the interaction  stems from a 
human then a computer  counter  partner,  indicating  that the aversive  re- 
sponse to negative  social interactions  is inﬂuenced  by the type of part- 
ner, and not just the process  of violation  itself ( Bellucci  et al., 2017 ). 
Finally,  a related domain  of social behavior  focuses  on altruistic  behav- 
ior ( Hu et al., 2017 ; Xiong et al., 2020 ) Xiong et al. (2020) . speciﬁ-  
cally looked at the inﬂuence  of the type of uncertainty  within this class 
of social decision-making  and found that additional  social uncertainty  
in the generation  of gratitude  –i n response  to being a potential  tar- 
get of an altruistic  act by somebody  else – recruited  areas such as the 
dorsal medial prefrontal  cortex and anterior  cingulate  cortex, which 
the authors  attributed  to mentalizing-  and conﬂict  monitoring-related  
processes.  
In this study, we will speciﬁcally  focus on the Trust Game as the 
social source of uncertainty.  We believe  this question  to be relevant  as 
there are instances  when a reciprocal  interaction  is sometimes  more of 
the risky type (e.g. lending  money to a relative/family  member/friend)  
and other times more ambiguous  in nature (business  transaction  with 
an unknown  person/new  business  partner).  A second point as to why 
our research  question  is relevant  concerns  its methodological  founda-  
tion. Namely,  it is not uncommon  that the distinction  between  risk and 
ambiguity  is itself uncertain  when dealing  with lottery and social con- 
texts. For example,  in Kosfeld  et al. (2005) the Trust Game is ambiguous  
as investors  do not receive  information  regarding  the likelihood  of re- 
ciprocation,  while they do receive  probabilistic  information  regarding  
reciprocation  in the non-social  computerized  treatment.  Are behavioral  
diﬀerences  then due to the source or type of uncertainty?  A key element  in our design, inspired  by work in experimental  eco- 
nomics which stresses  the importance  of internal  belief states on am- 
biguity preferences  ( Abdellaoui  et al., 2011 ; Trautmann  and van de 
Kuilen, 2015 ), is that we take individual  subjective  estimates  of social 
uncertainty  into account,  as participants  of course have naturally  occur- 
ring priors regarding  the likelihood  of reciprocation  in general.  This is 
important,  as it allows us to tailor and equate the underlying  risk and 
ambiguity  across social and non-social  contexts  individually  to each par- 
ticipant,  and not make (likely incorrect)  general  assumptions  about ‘typ- 
ical’ beliefs as to how our participants  view the trustworthiness  of others. 
This multi-faceted  approach  allows us to investigate  if the source of 
uncertainty  aﬀects the neural underpinnings  of ambiguity  preferences.  
Furthermore,  we can explore  the brain processes  underlying  individual  
diﬀerences  in ambiguity  preferences  as a function  of individual  beliefs 
about others’ reciprocal  behavior  (in the Trust Game) and likelihoods  
(lottery  context).  Taken together,  this approach  allows us to critically  
evaluate  the proposed  explanations  suggested  thus far as to the under- 
lying mechanism  of ambiguity  aversion  as a function  of the source of 
uncertainty.  
Based on the prior work in this area thus far, we predict that par- 
ticipants  will exhibit ambiguity  aversion  in general,  but we expect this 
aversion  to be greatest  in the social interactive  context  (as compared  
to lottery context)  due to additional  social factors such as, for example,  
betrayal  aversion.  Furthermore,  we expect that frontal brain regions,  
such as the OFC and IFG, as well as parietal  brain regions,  such as the 
posterior  parietal  cortex, will be involved  in general  risk and ambigu-  
ity processing,  while we expect the anterior  insula to be responsive  for 
social ambiguity  speciﬁcally.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-six  participants  (age range = 19–28 years, M age = 22.33 
years, 50% female)  were recruited  via SONA, the online system used 
by the Donders  Institute  for Brain, Cognition  and Behaviour  to manage  
the research  participant  pool. All participants  were pre-screened  for any 
behavioral  and health related abnormalities  via an online questionnaire,  
and the study was approved  by the local ethical committee.  
We excluded  ﬁve participants  from our sample prior to neuroimag-  
ing analysis.  Two participants  were excluded  because  of technical  issues 
with the neuroimaging  session (e.g. head coil was not applied  accord-  
ingly), one because  they did not believe  that there was real human in- 
teraction  in the social condition  (which led to extreme  choices  such as 
investing  all tokens in the lottery condition  and hardly any tokens in 
the Trust Game),  and ﬁnally two participants  because  they selected  the 
exact same investment  for all experimental  trials. The analyses  reported  
here are therefore  based on twenty-one  participants  ( M age = 22.27 years, 
57% female).  
We performed  a power analysis  based on the expected  eﬀect size of 
ambiguity  aversion  in order to determine  an appropriate  sample size. 
We used the package  simr ( Green and MacLeod,  2016 ) to calculate  
the observed  power in our experimental  study with an expected  ef- 
fect size of 0.3, as determined  by the literature  ( Trautmann  and van de 
Kuilen, 2015 ), and importantly  not based on our ﬁndings  themselves.  
Based on 1000 simulations,  a sample size of 21 participants  resulted  in 
90.20%  power for the estimated  behavioral  eﬀect of ambiguity  aver- 
sion, suggesting  adequate  power for this expected  eﬀect. We could not 
perform  a power analysis  on the neural level as we did not have pilot 
data nor could we locate a suitable  related dataset on NeuroVault.  
2.2. Experimental  design and statistical  analysis  
2.2.1. Sources  of uncertainty  
The Trust Game ( Berg et al., 1995 ) explores  the social source of un- 
certainty  in our experiment.  In our version  of this game there were two 
2  K. Fairley, J. Vyrastekova,  U. Weitzel et al. NeuroImage  251 (2022) 119007 
players:  the sender (known  as Trustor  in the original  paper) and receiver  
(known  as Trustee  in the original  paper).  The sender was endowed  with 
10 tokens and could choose between  six investment  amounts  (termed  
‘transfers’  in our instructions),  namely,  0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or all 10 tokens to 
be sent to the receiver.  As per common  practice,  we then tripled sender’s  
chosen transfer  before sending  this multiplied  amount  to the receiver.  
In a pre-scanning  behavioral  session,  receivers’  return choices  were col- 
lected. Receivers  could either choose to reciprocate  half of the received  
tokens or not reciprocate  at all, thus keeping  all the received  tokens.  
Importantly,  receivers  had to make their return choice unconditionally,  
that is, not knowing  if, and how many, tokens they would receive  (see 
Part A.2 in the Appendix  for detailed  instructions  given to participants  
in their role as receiver).  2 This element  in our design was crucial,  as 
senders  should then make investment  decisions  solely based on their 
beliefs about the receivers’  reciprocity.  In this way we ensured  that the 
decision  to invest was not confounded  by other motives,  for example  
signaling  trust ( McCabe  et al., 2003 ) or the elicitation  of positive  reci- 
procity ( Houser et al., 2010 ). Therefore,  in making  the transfer  decision,  
the sender had to consider  the likelihood  of receiving  an increase  in their 
original  endowment  with the risk of losing it all. 
We used a standard  Ellsberg  urn setup ( Ellsberg,  1961 ; 
Trautmann  and van de Kuilen, 2015 ) for our lottery,  i.e. non-social,  
context.  In this setup an imaginary  urn is ﬁlled with colored  marbles  
and participants  can bet on drawing  a particular  colored  marble.  As 
in the Trust Game, participants  could choose any investment  amount  
between  0 and 10 tokens before it was tripled.  The return choice in the 
lottery however  in this case stems from a random  mechanistic  device 
instead  of a conscious  choice made by a human being. To control for 
the fact that there is of course a second player in the Trust Game, we 
introduced  a dummy  player to the lottery context.  This dummy  player 
did not make any choice, but acted as a recipient  who received  the exact 
same outcome  as the receiver  would have earned in the Trust Game, 
but now based on the lottery outcome.  Therefore,  if a winning  (losing)  
marble was drawn in the lottery,  half (all) of the tripled investment  
went to the dummy  recipient.  By implementing  this feature,  we can 
control for social preferences  –for example,  warm glow from investing  
–a s a potential  confounding  factor ( Houser et al., 2010 ), and thereby  
made sure that any diﬀerence  in transfer  choices  was solely due to the 
source of uncertainty.  
2.2.2. Type of uncertainty  
Participants  made transfer  choices  in four diﬀerent  treatments:  a 
risky Trust Game (RTG), an ambiguous  Trust Game (ATG), a risky lottery 
(RLOT)  and an ambiguous  lottery (ALOT).  Senders  therefore  invested  in 
either a Trust Game or lottery which consisted  of either nine human re- 
ceivers or nine marbles.  
In the RTG the sender received  information  about the prior history 
of nine receivers,  that is, how many of the nine receivers  chose to recip- 
rocate and how many did not, ensuring  that decisions  made about how 
much to transfer  were essentially  risk-based.  However,  in the ATG they 
did not receive  any such probabilistic  information,  thereby  also adding 
ambiguity  to the transfer  decisions.  3 
In the RLOT each of nine marbles  had a diﬀerent,  known,  color, 
whereas  in the ALOT the lottery was made up of an unknown  compo-  
2 A total of 27 receivers  made an unconditional  return choice and 9 decided 
to return sender’s  investment  amount,  while the remaining  18 receivers  decided 
to keep the amount transferred  by the sender. Based on this composition,  in 
each Trust Game trial, we could randomly  draw a new set of 9 receivers  the 
fMRI participants  in their role as senders would interact with, with the obvious 
restriction  that this draw of 9 receivers  would correspond  to the objective  prob- 
ability of reciprocation  in the respective  RTG and the true underlying  likelihood  
of reciprocation  of 3/9 receivers  in the ATG. 
3 The operationalization  of social risk and ambiguity  in a RTG and ATG respec- 
tively was developed  by us and previously  tested in the behavioral  laboratory  
( Fairley et al., 2016 ). sition of the nine available  colors. Essentially  any set of combination  
of nine colors is possible  in the ALOT (thus 9 9 combinations).  In both 
the RLOT and ALOT participants  received  information  as to which of 
the nine colors were ‘winning’  colors. As the ALOT is an urn ﬁlled with 
nine marbles  of unknown  color composition,  receiving  information  re- 
garding  the number  of winning  colors represents  the underlying  likeli- 
hood of drawing  a winning  color, but is not the same as the objective  
probability  provided  in the RLOT, whereby  players  knew the exact like- 
lihood of winning.  Therefore,  deciding  on a transfer  in the ALOT does 
not provide  an objective  probability  as in a standard  risky setting,  yet 
the uncertainty  in the form of an underlying  likelihood  corresponds  to a 
prior a participant  likely forms when trusting  in another  receiver  in the 
ATG, albeit its source stems from a random  mechanistic  device instead  
of an actual human being. 
To reiterate  the similarity  between  the ATG and the ALOT –except  
for its source –i t is important  to notice that we aim to create a simi- 
lar underlying  subjective  probability  in both games. In the ALOT, par- 
ticipants  are not certain about the probability  with which a winning  
colored  marble is drawn, as it is unknow  how many winning  and los- 
ing colors are present  in the ambiguous  urn. Likewise,  when we form a 
group of 9 receivers  in the ATG (which come from the bigger popula-  
tion of 27 receivers),  the participant  does not know the composition  of 
(un)trustworthy  receivers.  Both in the ALOT and the ATG the participant  
is unaware  of the exact number  of winning  colors present  in the ALOT 
and unaware  of the exact number  of trustworthy  receivers  present  in the 
ATG. Below, we explain  carefully  how we pick the underlying  subjective  
probability  in the ATG and ALOT on an individual  basis.

The advent of ultra-high  ﬁeld 7 Tesla MRI has fundamentally  
changed  the opportunities  for subcortical  imaging.  First, by increased  
Signal-to-Noise  Ratio (SNR), image acquisition  at an unprecedented  
level of detail has become  possible.  Second,  the ﬁeld strength  depen- 
dence of relaxometry  parameters  such as 𝑅 ∗ 
2 has enabled  identiﬁcation  
and parcellation  of subcortical  structures  ( Bazin et al., 2020a; Keuken  
et al., 2018 ). By performing  quantitative  magnetic  resonance  imaging  
(qMRI),  intrinsic  tissue properties  are measured,  in which the result- 
ing values are independent  of the speciﬁc  MRI sequence  parameters  
( Tofts, 2005 ). The quantitative  metrics  allow for cross-sectionally  mon- 
itoring of subtle changes  over the life span and longitudinally  in disease  
progression.  Quantitative  7T MRI has thus set a new standard  in visual- 
izing subcortical  structures  ( Alkemade  et al., 2020 ). 
The relaxation  parameter  𝑅 ∗ 
2 measures  the eﬀective  spin-spin  relax- 
ation rate of tissues and ﬁnds its application  in image-guided  Deep Brain 
Stimulation  for Parkinson’s  disease  ( Isaacs et al., 2020 ), and detection  
of hemorrhage,  micro-calciﬁcations,  and iron deposits  ( Stüber et al., 
2014 ). These iron deposits  are a marker  of maturation,  as they are 
known to accumulate  with increasing  age, leading  to an increasing  in- 
homogeneous  appearance  of 𝑅 ∗ 
2 in deep nuclei. The interquartile  range 
of 𝑅 ∗ 
2 in e.g. the striatum  shows a strong linear correlation  with age 
( Mileti će t al., 2022 ). This demonstrates  the joint added beneﬁt of in- 
creased  𝑅 ∗ 
2 -contrast  and ultra high-resolution  imaging  at 7T. 
Quantitative  maps of tissue properties  typically  need the acquisition  
of multiple  images with diﬀerent  speciﬁcations  ( Tofts, 2005 ). Conven-  
tionally,  𝑅 ∗ 
2 is ﬁtted from reconstructed  images of multiple  echo times 
acquired  with a multi-echo  gradient  echo (ME-GRE)  sequence.  While 
conventional  ultra-high  resolution  MRI acquisitions  are already  time- 
consuming,  scanning  the multiple  images under varying  relaxometry  
conditions  necessary  for qMRI may take even longer. This often exceeds  
the acceptable  time in the clinic and can make imaging  vulnerable  to 
involuntary  subject motion ( Andre et al., 2015 ). 
Imaging  may be accelerated  by acquiring  fewer samples  in k-space,  
resulting  in sparse data, for which multiple  reconstruction  methods  have 
been proposed.  Parallel  imaging  ( Griswold  et al., 2002; Pruessmann  
et al., 1999 ) is well established,  which with its more recent variants  
such as SPIRiT ( Lustig and Pauly, 2010 ), ESPIRiT  ( Uecker et al., 2014 ), 
LORAKS  ( Haldar,  2013 ), and joint virtual coil reconstructions  ( Bilgic 
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; 2020 ) makes use of the extra spatial 
encoding  from multi-channel  receive  coils. Compressed  sensing  ( Bilgic 
et al., 2011; Chatnuntawech  et al., 2016; Ehrhardt  and Betcke,  2016; 
Haldar et al., 2011; Kopanoglu  et al., 2020; Küstner  et al., 2016; Lustig 
et al., 2008; Maier et al., 2019 ) and dictionary  learning  based methods  
( Caballero  et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014; Ravishankar  and Bresler,  
2010; Rueda et al., 2013; Wang and Ying, 2014; Zhan et al., 2015 ) fur- 
ther exploit the image prior of sparsity  in a sparsifying  domain,  e.g., by 
the wavelet  transform,  total variation,  or adaptively  learned  dictionary  
transform  of the image. 
Following  up, deep learning-based  methods  have been proposed,  
aiming to further accelerate  imaging.  Deep neural networks  can approx-  
imate a prior customized  to the task of MRI reconstruction  by learn- 
ing from training  data. Deep learning  has set the state-of-the-art  perfor- 
mance in multiple  reconstruction  tasks recently  ( Knoll et al., 2020; Liang 
et al., 2020; Muckley  et al., 2021 ). Deﬁning  an optimization  problem  
for reconstruction,  the iterative  optimization  process  can be unrolled  
into deep networks  ( Gregor and LeCun, 2010 ), or approached  with the 
recurrent  neural networks  ( Putzky and Welling,  2017 ). Following  up, 
it was understood  that deep learning-based  reconstruction  may bene- 
ﬁt from the physics-based  known forward  model for image reconstruc-  
tion. Typically,  this model is formulated  in the optimization  problem  
and embedded  in the learning  and inference  processes,  e.g., in the vari- 
ational networks  ( Hammernik  et al., 2018 ) and the Recurrent  Inference  
Machine  (RIM) ( Lønning  et al., 2019 ), among others ( Schlemper  et al., 
2017; Aggarwal  et al., 2018; Tezcan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020 ). 
While the acceleration  techniques  in weighted  imaging  treat acqui- 
sitions independently,  qMRI gives the unique opportunity  to further ac- celerate  imaging  thanks to the shared information  implicitly  embedded  
in repeated  acquisitions.  In qMRI applications,  the domain  prior knowl- 
edge provided  by a compact  forward  model that maps the parameters  
directly  into the k-space  can be exploited.  This has been done in pi- 
oneering  works such as in compressed  sensing  ( Doneva  et al., 2010 ), 
low-rank  reconstruction  ( Lee et al., 2016 ), and through  an end-to-end  
convolutional  neural network  ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Recent work showed  
the feasibility  in the context  of T 1 -mapping  using an unfolded  network  
( Jun et al., 2021 ). 
In this paper, we present  the quantitative  Recurrent  Inference  Ma- 
chine (qRIM)  for reconstructing  accurate  and precise 𝑅 ∗ 
2 maps from 
highly accelerated  high-resolution  7T data. To this end, we adopt a 
physical  model jointly describing  the parametric  model and image re- 
construction.  This model describes  the expected  signal in k-space  given 
𝑅 ∗ 
2 while accommodating  ﬁeld inhomogeneities.  We embed this model 
in a RIM network  towards  better exploitation  of the implicit  correlation  
over the multiple  images in the acquisition.  Speciﬁcally,  with the uni- 
ﬁed forward  physical  model, we adopt the convolutional  RIM network  
( Lønning  et al., 2019 ) to directly  reconstruct  the parameter  map from 
the subsampled  k-space.  We also implicitly  exploit the signal correlation  
within a vicinity  of the voxel through  the receptive  ﬁeld of the network.  
We thereby  aim to avoid large errors due to ampliﬁed  noise at the voxel 
level in sparsely  sampled  data at ultrahigh  resolution.  An overview  of 
the proposed  framework  for accelerated  𝑅 ∗ 
2 -mapping  is given in Fig. 1 . 
The qRIM network  is trained  on motion-corrected  raw data of 
the Amsterdam  Ultra-high  ﬁeld adult lifespan  database  (AHEAD)  
( Alkemade  et al., 2020 ). Experiments  are performed  to assess accuracy  
and precision  in 𝑅 ∗ 
2 for increasing  acceleration  factors.  Furthermore,  we 
perform  a validation  experiment  into subcortical  maturation,  taking the 
increasingly  inhomogeneous  appearance  of 𝑅 ∗ 
2 with age in the striatum  
as an implicit  resolution  marker.  We expect the qRIM to be better able 
to maintain  tissue structure  while reducing  imaging  noise compared  to 
conventional  reconstruction.  
Since the extension  of the uniﬁed forward  model is in general  ap- 
plicable  to the physics-informed  deep networks  that wrap an unrolled  
optimization,  we also extended  the proposed  framework  in the state-of-  
the-art End-to-End  Variational  Network  ( Sriram et al., 2020 ) as compar-  
ison. 
The remainder  of the paper is organized  as follows.  
Section  2 presents  the joint optimization  problem  of a uniﬁed model of 
image reconstruction  and relaxation  for 𝑅 ∗ 
2 mapping.  Section  3 explains  
the quantitative  RIM that is customized  to estimate  𝑅 ∗ 
2 with the uniﬁed 
model. Section  4 explains  the Quantitative  End-to-End  Variational  Net- 
work with the extended  uniﬁed forward  model. Section  5 describes  the 
datasets,  the RIM network  architecture,  and the details of training  and 
evaluation  of which the results are presented  in Section  6 . Following  a 
discussion  in Section  7 , the conclusions  are drawn in Section  8 . 
2. Theory  
2.1. Uniﬁed model 
In order to deﬁne a uniﬁed forward  model from the quantitative  
relaxation  parameter  map 𝑅 ∗ 
2 to k-space  coil signals,  let us ﬁrst introduce  
the 𝑅 ∗ 
2 relaxation  model. 
In qMRI, multiple  images are acquired  in the same subject with dif- 
ferent acquisition  parameters  in order to obtain quantitative  parameter  
maps. Speciﬁcally,  for 𝑅 ∗ 
2 estimation  with the ME-GRE  sequence,  images 
of multiple  echoes are acquired.  With noise neglected,  the measured  
complex-valued  image 𝒙 𝑡 ∈ℂ 𝑃 of 𝑃 voxels at echo 𝑡 with echo time TE t 
follows  this forward  relaxation  model: 
𝒙 𝑡 = 𝑴 ⊙e − 𝑇𝐸 𝑡 ( 𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 − 𝑩 0 𝑖 ) , (1) 
where 𝑴 ∈ℂ 𝑃 is the net magnetization,  and ⊙represents  Hadamard  
product.  𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 ∈ℝ 𝑃 is the parameter  map of 𝑅 ∗ 
2 and 𝑩 0 ∈ℝ 𝑃 is the oﬀ-

pathway  (via the orange arrow), in application  to 𝑹 ∗

mapping.  In qMRI, each echo time in the echo train 
is ﬁlled into its individual  k-space.  The conventional  
pathway  performs  image reconstruction  from k-space 
of every echo time and subsequently  voxel-wise  ﬁt- 
ting of the relaxation  model from the reconstructed  
images, while our proposed  method performs  simulta-  
neous reconstruction  and relaxation  model ﬁtting with

rent Inference  Machine  (qRIM). 
resonance  of the static magnetic  ﬁeld, and the exponent  is taken element  
wise. 
Providing  the known image 𝒙 𝑡 and following  the forward  model of 
image reconstruction  for acquisition  with a multi-channel  receive  coil, 
the corresponding  k-space  of coil channel  𝑐is given by 
𝒚 𝑡,𝑐 = 𝐺ℱ 𝑺 𝑐 𝒙 𝑡 + 𝒏 𝑡,𝑐 , (2) 
where the image 𝒙 𝑡 is sensed by coil channel  𝑐with the sensitivities  
contained  in a diagonal  matrix 𝑺 𝑐 ∈ℂ 𝑃×𝑃 , and Fourier  transformed  
in k-space  signals by ℱ , followed  by the subsampling  operation  𝐺 ∈
{0 , 1} 𝑄 ×𝑃 , 𝑄 ≪ 𝑃 , with exactly one nonzero  in each row and usually  
not more than one nonzero  in each column,  which is a common  prac- 
tice for accelerating  the imaging.  𝒏 𝑡,𝑐 ∈ℂ 𝑄 is the noise of the sampled  
positions  for echo 𝑡 in coil channel  𝑐. 
Substituting  Eq. (1) into Eq. (2) , we unify the relaxation  model and 
the forward  model of image reconstruction  as 
𝒚 𝑡,𝑐 = 𝐺ℱ 𝑺 𝑐 ( 𝑴 ⊙e − 𝑇𝐸 𝑡 ( 𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 − 𝑩 0 𝑖 ) ) + 𝒏 𝑡,𝑐 . (3) 
This uniﬁed forward  model facilitates  mapping  from our parameters  of 
interest,  i.e., 𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 , 𝑴 , and 𝑩 0 , to k-space  signals 𝒚 . 
2.2. Problem  formulation  
With the uniﬁed forward  model, we aim to estimate  the parameters  
𝚽= { 𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 , 𝑴 , 𝑩 0 } from k-space  𝒚 . From the perspective  of maximum  a 
posteriori  (MAP) estimation,  this inverse  problem  is solved by maximiz-  
ing the sum of the log-likelihood  and log-prior  distributions:  
̂𝚽= arg max 
𝚽{ log 𝑝 ( 𝒚 |𝚽) + log 𝑝 ( 𝚽)} . (4) 
The (negative)  log-likelihood  log 𝑝 ( 𝒚 |𝚽) is derived  as data consis- 
tency between  the measured  k-space  𝒚 and the prediction  through  
Eq. (3) with the estimated  parameters:  
log 𝑝 ( 𝒚 |̂𝚽) = 1

𝑡 =1 𝐶 ∑

 𝑺 𝑐 ( ̂𝑴 ⊙e − 𝑇𝐸 𝑡 ( ̂𝑹 ∗ 
𝟐 − ̂𝑩 0 𝑖 ) ) − 𝒚 𝑡,𝑐 ‖‖‖‖2 
2 . (5) 
The log-prior  log 𝑝 ( 𝚽) can be seen as a regularizer,  acting dependent  
on how the prior knowledge  is modeled.  For example,  in compressed  sensing,  it is commonly  regarded  as the 𝑙1 -norm of sparsity  of parame-  
ters in sparsity  domains.  In deep learning  based methods  it can be the 
network  trained  from datasets  with similar distributions  as the target

approaches  mentioned  above, HMMs can pool non-contiguous  periods  
of data together  to make robust estimations  of the activity  of brain 
networks,  including  FC. However,  they do so by incorporating  these 
two stages into one model. HMMs (as well as other techniques,  such 
as microstates  Michel and Koenig,  2018 ) have been used to show that 
brain networks  evolve at faster time scales than previously  suggested  
by competing  techniques  (such as independent  component  analysis)  
( Baker et al., 2014 ). In the context  of M/EEG,  HMMs have been used 
to elucidate  transient  brain states ( Vidaurre  et al., 2016 ), model sensor 
level ﬂuctuations  in covariance  ( Woolrich  et al., 2013 ) and reveal la- 
tent task dynamics  attributed  to distributed  brain regions  ( Quinn et al., 
2018 ). More recently,  Seedat et al. applied  an HMM to detect transient  
bursting  activity  and showed  it was correlated  to aspects  of the elec- 
trophysiological  connectome  ( Seedat et al., 2020 ), whilst Higgins  et al. 
were able to show that replay in humans  coincides  with activation  of 
the default mode network  ( Higgins  et al., 2021 ). 
Although  very powerful,  convenient,  and informative,  traditional  
HMMs are themselves  limited in two key ways. Firstly, there is the mod- 
elling choice that the state at any time point is only conditionally  depen- 
dent on the state at the previous  time point (i.e. the model is Markovian).  
This limits the modelling  capability  of the technique  as there is no way 
for any long-range  temporal  dependencies  between  historic  state occur- 
rences and the current  state to be established  Gschwind  et al. (2015) . 
While approaches  that use Hidden  Semi-Markov  Models  have been pro- 
posed, they are limited in the complexity  of long-range  temporal  depen- 
dencies  they can capture  ( Trujillo-Barreto  et al., 2019 ). Secondly,  HMMs 
adopt a mutually  exclusive  state model, meaning  that data can only be 
generated  by one set of observation  model parameters  at any given in- 
stance. True brain dynamics  might be better modelled  by patterns  that 
can ﬂexibly  combine  and mix over time. The mutual exclusivity  con- 
straint was found to lead to errors in inferred  functional  brain network  
metrics  in Pervaiz  et al. (2022) . 
We set to address  these two limitations  in this paper and do so by in- 
troducing  a new generative  model for neuroimaging  data. Speciﬁcally,  
we model the time-varying  mean and covariance  of the data as a linear 
weighted  sum of spatially  distributed  patterns  of activity  or “modes  ”. 
Notably,  we do not impose mutual exclusivity  on mode activation.  Sim- 
ilarly, we drop the assumption  that the dynamics  of the modes are a 
function  of a Markovian  process.  This is achieved  by using a unidi- 
rectional  recurrent  neural network  (RNN) ( Géron, 2019 ) to model the 
temporal  evolution  of the weighted  sum. The memory  provided  by the 
RNN facilitates  a richer context  to the changes  in the instantaneous  
mean and covariance  than what would be aﬀorded  by a traditional  
HMM. 
In this work, we use Bayesian  methods  ( Friston et al., 2007 ) to infer 
the parameters  of the generative  model. With this method,  we learn a 
distribution  for each parameter,  which allows us to incorporate  uncer- 
tainty into our parameter  estimates.  Having  observed  data, we update 
the distributions  to ﬁnd likely parameters  for the model to have gen- 
erated the data. In this work, we adapt a method  used in variational  
autoencoders  ( Kingma  and Welling,  2014 ) to infer the model parame-  
ter distributions.  One component  of this is amortised  inference,  which 
works through  the deployment  of an inference  network.  In our case the 
inference  network  is another  RNN, which is bidirectional  ( Géron, 2019 ) 
and learns a mapping  from the observed  data to the model parameter  
distributions.  The use of an inference  network  facilitates  the scaling and 
application  of this technique  to very large datasets,  without  ever needing  
(necessarily)  to increase  the number  of inference  network  parameters  to 
be learnt. 
To update our model parameter  distributions,  we minimise  the 
variational  free energy (see Section  2.2 ) using stochastic  gradient  de- 
scent ( Géron, 2019 ). We do this by sampling  from the model pa- 
rameter  distributions  using the reparameterization  trick ( Kingma  and 
Welling,  2014 ). The ability to estimate  the variational  free energy by 
sampling  enables  us to use sophisticated  generative  models that include  
highly non-linear  transformations  that would not be feasible  with clas- sical Bayesian  methods.  Taken together,  we call the generative  model 
and inference  framework  DyNeMo  (Dynamic  Network  Modes).  
2. Methods  
In this section we outline the generative  model and describe  the in- 
ference  of model parameters.  We also describe  the datasets  and prepro-  
cessing steps carried out in this work. 
2.1. Generative  model 
Here we propose  a model for generating  neuroimaging  data that ex- 
plicitly models functional  brain networks,  including  a metric of their 
FC, as a dynamic  quantity.  The model describes  time series data using 
a set of modes , which are constituent  elements  that can be combined  to 
deﬁne time-varying  statistics  of the data. When trained  on neuroimag-  
ing data, modes are simply static spatial brain activity  patterns  that can 
overlap  with each other. We refer to them as “modes  ”to emphasise  that 
the model is not categorical,  i.e. that modes should not be mistaken  for 
mutually  exclusive  states (as would be the case in an HMM).  Similar  
to an HMM, our generative  model has two components:  a latent repre- 
sentation  and a data generating  process  given the latent representation,  
which is referred  to as an observation  model . In our case, the latent repre- 
sentation  is a set of mixing coeﬃcients  𝜶𝑡 and the observation  model is a 
multivariate  normal  distribution.  The mean and covariance  of the multi- 
variate normal  distribution  is determined  by linearly  mixing the modes’ 
spatial models,  i.e. means 𝝁𝑗 and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 , with the coeﬃcients  
𝜶𝑡 . The mixing coeﬃcients  are dynamic  in nature whereas  the modes 
are static. Therefore,  dynamics  in the observed  data are captured  in the 
dynamics  of the mixing coeﬃcients.  The mixing coeﬃcients  provide  a 
low-dimensional  and interpretable  dynamic  description  of the data and 
modes correspond  to static spatial distributions  of activity/FC,  where 
mode-speciﬁc  FC is captured  by the between-brain-region  correlations  
in 𝑫 𝑗 . Both of these quantities  are useful for understanding  the data. An 
overview  of the generative  model is shown in Fig. 1 and a mathematical  
formulation  is given below. 
At each time point 𝑡 there is a probabilistic  vector of free parameters,  
referred  to as a logit and denoted  by 𝜽𝑡 . The logits are distributed  in 
accordance  with a multivariate  normal  distribution,  
𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) =  ( 𝝁𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) , 𝝈2 
𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 )) , (1) 
where 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 denotes  a sequence  of historic  logits { 𝜽1 , …, 𝜽𝑡 −1 } , 𝝁𝜃𝑡 is a 
mean vector and 𝝈2 
𝜃𝑡 is a diagonal  covariance  matrix.  We use a unidi- 
rectional  RNN to predict future values of 𝝁𝜃𝑡 and 𝝈𝜃𝑡 based on previous  
logits 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 . The logit at each time point 𝜽𝑡 is sampled  from the distri- 
bution 𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) . The historic  values of the logits 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 are fed into 
the RNN: 
𝝁𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) = 𝑔 𝜇( LSTM ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 )) , 
𝝈𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) = 𝜉( 𝑔 𝜎( LSTM ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ))) , (2) 
where 𝑔 𝜇and 𝑔 𝜎are learnt aﬃne transformations,  𝜉is a softplus  function  
included  to ensure the standard  deviations  𝝈𝜃𝑡 are positive,  and LSTM is 
a type of RNN known as a Long Short Term Memory  network  (). We refer 
to this network  as the model RNN . The logits 𝜽𝑡 are used to determine  a 
set of mixing coeﬃcients,  
𝜶𝑡 = 𝜁( 𝜽𝑡 ) , (3) 
where 𝜁is a softmax  function  which assures  that the 𝜶𝑡 values are pos- 
itive and sum to one. 2 The mixing coeﬃcients  are then used together  
2 Including  the positivity  constraint  enables us to interpret  the 𝜶𝑡 values as 
mixing coeﬃcients  and the sum to one constraint  ensures the distribution  of 
mixing coeﬃcients  is suﬃciently  non-Gaussian  for the model to be identiﬁ-  
able ( Eriksson  and Koivunen,  2004 ).

𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽<𝑡 ) , which we sample to predict the next logit, 𝜽𝑡 , (un- 
ﬁlled squares).  These logits are transformed  via a softmax op- 
eration to give the mixing coeﬃcients,  𝜶𝑡 , (unﬁlled  circles). 
The softmax transformation  enforces  the mixing coeﬃcients  
are positive and sum to one at any instance  in time. Separate  
from the dynamics  are the corresponding  spatial models that 
describe  brain network  activity as a set of modes (depicted  
in diﬀerent  colours here); via a mean vector, 𝝁𝑗 , and covari- 
ance matrix, 𝑫 𝑗 . The mode spatial models combine  with the 
dynamic  mixing coeﬃcients  (linear mixing) to parameterise  
a multivariate  normal distribution  with a time-varying  mean 
vector, 𝒎 𝑡 , and covariance  matrix, 𝑪 𝑡 . Note, we do not enforce 
any constraint  on the modes means 𝝁𝑗 and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 , 
this means they can overlap in time and space and the overall 
activity ( 𝒎 𝑡 and 𝑪 𝑡 ) can vary. (For interpretation  of the refer- 
ences to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to

2.2. Inference  
In this section we describe  the framework  employed  to infer the pa- 
rameters  of our generative  model. Namely,  the logits 𝜽𝑡 , mode means 𝝁𝑗 
and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 . In this work, we use variational  Bayesian  inference  
to learn the full posterior  distribution  for 𝜽𝑡 and point estimates  for 𝝁𝑗 
and 𝑫 𝑗 . 
Variational  Bayes In Bayesian  inference,  we would like to learn a 
distribution,  referred  to as the posterior  distribution  , for the variable  we 
are trying to estimate  given some data we have observed.  In variational  
Bayesian  inference,  we approximate  the posterior  distribution  with a 
simple distribution,  referred  to as the variational  posterior  distribution  𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 ) , and aim to minimise  the Kullback-Leibler  (KL) divergence  between  
the variational  and true posterior,  which amounts  to minimising  the 
variational  free energy (or equivalently,  maximising  the evidence  lower 
bound).  In classical  variational  Bayes ( Bishop,  2007; Woolrich  et al., 
2009; Zhang et al., 2018 ), this involves  formulating  update rules for the 
parameters  of the variational  posterior  distribution  given some observed  
data. Deriving  these update rules is only made possible  by limiting  the 
complexity  of the generative  model for the observed  data and restrict-  
ing the variational  posterior  to conjugate  distributions.  In addition  to 
this, we have a separate  variational  distribution  for each variable  we 
are trying to estimate.  Also in classical  variational  Bayes, we learn the 
parameters  of each variational  distribution  separately,  which becomes  
problematic  in terms of computer  memory  requirements  when we wish 
to estimate  a large number  of variables.  
In brief, we overcome  these diﬃculties  with a technique  adapted  
from variational  autoencoders  ( Kingma  and Welling,  2014 ). This de- 
ploys a neural network  (which we call the inference  network  ) to perform  
amortised  inference,  which helps the approach  to scale to large numbers  
of observations  over time; and a sampling  technique  (known  as the repa- 
rameterization  trick ) that allows us to learn a full posterior  distribution  
for 𝜽𝑡 ( Kingma  and Welling,  2014 ). We learn point estimates  of 𝝁𝑗 and 
𝑫 𝑗 using trainable  free parameters.  We update estimates  for 𝝁𝑗 , 𝑫 𝑗 , and 
the posterior  distribution  parameters  of 𝜽𝑡 , to minimise  the variational  
free energy using stochastic  gradient  descent.

Fig. 2. The full DyNeMo  framework.  A sequence  of observed  
data, 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 , is fed into a bidirectional  RNN which parameterises  
the approximate  variational  posterior  distribution  for the logit 
time series, 𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . We sample 𝜃𝑠 
𝑡 from the variational  pos- 
terior distribution  using the reparameterization  trick (aster- 
isks, orange background)  and feed the samples  into the model 
RNN to predict the prior distribution  one time step in the fu- 
ture 𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 +1 |𝜽1∶ 𝑡 ) . The prior and posterior  distribution  are used 
to calculate  the KL divergence  term of the variational  free en- 
ergy. The samples  from the variational  posterior  distribution  
𝜃𝑠 
𝑡 are also used to generate  the observed  data by ﬁrst applying  
a softmax transformation  to calculate  the mixing coeﬃcients,  
𝜶𝑡 , (unﬁlled  circles, orange background).  These mixing coeﬃ- 
cients are then combined  with the spatial model of each mode, 
which is a mean vector, 𝝁𝑗 , and covariance  matrix, 𝑫 𝑗 . This 
gives an estimate  of the time-varying  mean, 𝒎 𝑡 , and covari- 
ance, 𝑫 𝑗 , which is used to calculate  the negative  log-likelihood  
term of the variational  free energy. 
Logits 𝜽𝒕 Focusing  on the full posterior  inference  of the logits 𝜽𝑡 , here, 
we use amortised  inference  ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). This involves  using an 
inference  network  to learn a mapping  from the observed  data to the 
parameters  of the variational  posterior.  The rationale  for this approach  
is that the computation  from past inferences  can be reused in future 
inferences.  The use of an inference  network  ﬁxes the number  of trainable  
parameters  to the number  of internal  weights  and biases in the inference  
network.  This is usually  signiﬁcantly  smaller  than the number  of time 
points, which allows us to eﬃciently  scale to bigger datasets.  
Inference  network  We now describe  the inference  network  in detail. 
Having  observed  the time series 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 , we approximate  the variational  
posterior  distribution  for 𝜽𝑡 as 
𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) =  ( 𝒎 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) , 𝒔 2 
𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 )) , (5) 
where 𝒎 𝜃𝑡 and 𝒔 2 
𝜃𝑡 are the variational  posterior  mean and covariance  of a 
multivariate  normal  distribution  respectively.  The variational  posterior  
covariance  is a diagonal  matrix.  We use a bidirectional  RNN for the 
inference  network,  which we refer to as the inference  RNN . This network  
outputs  the parameters  of the variational  posterior  distribution  given the 
observed  data: 
𝒎 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) = 𝑓 𝑚 ( BLSTM  ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 )) 
𝒔 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) = 𝜉( 𝑓 𝑠 ( BLSTM  ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ))) , (6) 
where 𝑓 𝑚 and 𝑓 𝑠 are aﬃne transformations  and BLSTM denotes  a bidi- 
rectional  LSTM. The complete  DyNeMo  framework  and interplay  be- 
tween the generative  model and inference  network  is shown in Fig. 2 . 
Loss function  Having  outlined  the inference  network  for the logits, we 
turn our attention  to the loss function  used in DyNeMo.  In variational  Bayesian  inference  we infer a parameter,  in this case 𝜽𝑡 , by minimising  
the variational  free energy ( Friston et al., 2006 ), 
𝐹 = − ∫𝑞( 𝜽1∶ 𝑁 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) log ( 𝑝 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 |𝜽1∶ 𝑁 ) 𝑝 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑁 ) 
𝑞( 𝜽1∶ 𝑁 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) ) 
d 𝜽1∶ 𝑁 , (7) 
where 𝑝 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑁 ) is the prior and 𝑝 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 |𝜽1∶ 𝑁 ) is the likelihood.  With this 
approach  the inference  problem  is cast as an optimisation  problem,  
which can be eﬃciently  solved with the use of stochastic  gradient  de- 
scent ( Géron, 2019 ). Here, we make stochastic  estimates  of a loss func- 
tion, and use the gradient  of the loss function  to update the trainable  
parameters  in our model. However,  to estimate  the loss function  we 
must calculate  the integral  in Eq. (7) . In DyNeMo,  this is done using 
a sampling  technique  (i.e. the reparameterization  trick) to give Monte 
Carlo estimates  of the loss function.  
Insight into the loss function  is gained by re-writing  Eq. (7) as two 
terms (see SI 1.1): 
𝐹 = − LL + KL . (8) 
The ﬁrst term is referred  to as the log-likelihood  term and the second 
term is referred  to as the KL divergence  term . The log-likelihood  term 
acts to give the most probable  estimate  for the logits that could gen- 
erate the training  data and the KL divergence  term acts to regularise  
the estimate.  Relating  this to components  of DyNeMo,  it is the inference  
RNN that infers the logits, which together  with the learnt mode means 
and covariances  determine  the log-likelihood  term, whilst the model 
RNN regularises  the inferred  logits through  its role as the prior in the 
KL divergence  term. It is the temporal  regularisation  provided  by the 
model RNN that distinguishes  DyNeMo  from a Gaussian  mixture  model 
4  C. Gohil, E. Roberts, R. Timms et al. NeuroImage  263 (2022) 119595 
(GMM).  The beneﬁt of including  a model RNN for temporal  regularisa-  
tion is discussed  in SI 1.4. 
We now detail the calculation  used to estimate  the loss function.  The 
log-likelihood  term is given by 
LL = 𝑁 ∑
𝑡 =1 log ( 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑡 |𝜽1 
𝑡 )) , (9) 
where 𝑝 ( 𝒙 𝑡 |𝜽1 
𝑡 ) is the likelihood  of generating  data 𝒙 𝑡 at time point 𝑡 
given the latent variable  is 𝜽1 
𝑡 , which is a sample from the variational  
posterior  𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . The superscript  in 𝜽1 
𝑡 indicates  that it is the ﬁrst 
sample from 𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . Only one sample from the variational  posterior  
at each time point is used to estimate  the log-likelihood  term. Note that 
the likelihood  is a multivariate  normal  whose mean and covariance  is 
determined  by Eq. (4) . Therefore,  the likelihood  depends  on the logits 
𝜽𝑡 , mode means 𝝁𝑗 and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 . The KL divergence  term is given 
by 
KL = 𝑁 ∑
𝑡 =2 𝐷 KL ( 𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) ||𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1 
1∶ 𝑡 −1 )) , (10) 
where 𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1 
1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) is the prior distribution  for 𝜽𝑡 given a single sam- 
ple for the previous  logits 𝜽1 
1 , …, 𝜽1 
𝑡 −1 from their respective  varia- 
tional posteriors  𝑞( 𝜽1 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) , …, 𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 −1 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) and 𝐷 KL is the KL diver- 
gence ( Bishop,  2007 ) between  the variational  posterior  and prior. A full 
derivation  of the loss function  is given in SI 1.1. 
Reparameterization  trick Next, we outline the method  used to sample 
from the variational  posterior  distribution  𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . This is a multi- 
variate normal  distribution  with mean vector 𝒎 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) and diagonal  
covariance  matrix 𝒔 2 
𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . To obtain a sample 𝜽𝑠 
𝑡 from 𝑞( 𝜽𝑡 |𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) , we 
use the reparameterization  trick ( Kingma  and Welling,  2014 ), where we 
sample from a normal  distribution,  
𝝐∼ (0 , 𝑰 ) , (11) 
where 𝑰 is the identity  matrix.  𝝐𝑠 denotes  the 𝑠 th sample from  (0 , 𝑰 ) . 
We calculate  the samples  for the logits as 
𝜽𝑠 
𝑡 = 𝒎 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) + 𝒔 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) 𝝐𝑠 , (12) 
where 𝒔 𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) is a vector containing  the square root of the diagonal  
from 𝒔 2 
𝜃𝑡 ( 𝒙 1∶ 𝑁 ) . The use of the reparameterization  trick allows us to di- 
rectly minimise  the loss function  using stochastic  gradient  descent.  
Mode means 𝝁𝒋 and covariances  𝑫 𝒋 Having  detailed  the inference  of 
the logits 𝜽𝑡 and the calculation  of the loss function,  we now turn our 
attention  to the spatial models described  by the means 𝝁𝑗 and covari- 
ances 𝑫 𝑗 . We performed  fully Bayesian  inference  on the logits, as they 
are temporally  local parameters,  and hence will have reasonably  large 
amounts  of uncertainty  in their estimation  which needs to be propa- 
gated to the inference  of 𝜽𝑡 over time. By contrast,  the mode means 𝝁𝑗 
and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 are global parameters  whose inference  can draw on 
information  over all time points. As a result we choose to use point es- 
timates  for 𝝁𝑗 and 𝑫 𝑗 , which are learnt using trainable  free parameters.  
Additionally,  learning  point estimates  when they are suﬃcient  has the 
advantage  of simplifying  inference.  
The time-varying  mean vector 𝒎 𝑡 constructed  from the mode means 
𝝁𝑗 can take on any value, and can therefore  be treated as free parame-  
ters. However,  the time-varying  covariance  𝑪 𝑡 constructed  from the 𝑫 𝑗 
matrices  is required  to be positive  deﬁnite.  We enforce  this by parame-  
terising  the 𝑫 𝑗 ’s using the Cholesky  decomposition,  
𝑫 𝑗 = 𝑳 𝑗 𝑳 ′
𝑗 , (13) 
where 𝑳 𝑗 is a lower triangular  matrix known as a Cholesky  factor and ′
denotes  the matrix transpose.  We learn 𝑳 𝑗 as a vector of free parameters  
that is used to ﬁll a lower triangular  matrix.  We also apply a softplus  
operation  and add a small positive  value to the diagonal  of the Cholesky  
factor to improve  training  stability.  Using this approach,  we learn point 
estimates  for the mode means and covariances.  Table 1

Hyperparameters,  initialisation  and training  The full DyNeMo  model 
contains  several hyperparameters,  for example  the number  of layers and 
hidden units in the RNNs, the batch size, the learning  rate, and many 
more. These all must be speciﬁed  before training  the model. DyNeMo  
also contains  a large number  of trainable  parameters,  which must be 
initialised.  A description  of the hyperparameters  and the initialisation  
of trainable  parameters  is given in SI 1.2. Hyperparameters  for each 
dataset used in this work are summarised  in Table 1 . There are also 
several techniques  that can be used to improve  model training,  such as 
KL annealing  ( Bowman  et al., 2015 ) and using multiple  starts. These are 
also discussed  in detail in SI 1.2.

ground  voice when the auditory  stimuli were paired with videos of 
a speaker’s  talking face, but not when they were paired with a still 
image of the speaker’s  face ( Hollich  et al., 2005 ). Studies  with chil- 
dren and adults found that children  identiﬁed  phonemes  and words 
better in the auditory-visual  modality  compared  to the auditory-only  
modality,  and that this beneﬁt is evident  both in quiet ( Lalonde  and 
Holt, 2015 ) and in noise ( Lalonde  and Holt, 2016 ; Maidment  et al., 2015 ; 
Ross et al., 2011 ). Additionally,  comparisons  between  children  and 
adults revealed  that adults experienced  greater auditory-visual  speech 
beneﬁt ( Maidment  et al., 2015 ; Ross et al., 2011 ). 
The same developmental  trend has been found in neurophysiological  
studies with children  and adults. Knowland  et al. (2014) presented  6- to 
11-year-olds  and adults with auditory-visual  words and with auditory-  
only words. Both the children  and the adults showed  attenuated  am- 
plitude and shorter latencies  of the auditory  P2 event-related  potential  
(ERP) component  to auditory-visual  compared  to auditory-only  words, 
but the adults additionally  showed  the attenuated  amplitude  and shorter 
latencies  for N1 for auditory-visual  compared  to auditory-only  stimuli.  
Together  these results suggest  that visual speech modulation  of audi- 
tory ERP components  is present,  yet not fully developed  in children  
( Knowland  et al., 2014 ). 
Other ERP studies have measured  speech perception  in auditory-  
visual vs auditory-only  and visual-only  speech in terms of integration  
rather than enhancement.  The criterion  for auditory-visual  integration  
is based on the relative  magnitude  of neural responses  to auditory-  
visual (AV) stimuli compared  with the summation  of neural responses  
to auditory-only  (A) and visual-only  (V) stimuli [i.e., by testing whether  
AV = ( A + V ) no integration,  or whether  AV > A + V , integration].  
Using this method,  Kaganovich  and Schumaker  (2014) revealed  that 
peak amplitudes  of N1 and P2, and the latency  of P2 were attenuated  
in auditory-visual  compared  to the algebraic  sum of ERP responses  to 
auditory-only  and visual-only  /ba/, /da/, and /ga/ syllables  in 7–8-year-  
olds, 10–11-year-olds,  and adults, thereby  indicating  auditory-visual  in- 
tegration  at all three ages. In a separate  study, adult participants  showed  
a signiﬁcantly  shorter latency  of the auditory  N1/P2 response  peak 
when presented  with /ka/, /pa/, and /ta/ in auditory-visual  syllables  
than in auditory-only  or visual-only  syllables  ( van Wassenhove  et al., 
2005 ). 
The same integration  approach  has not been used with infants;  
rather, the majority  of the electrophysiological  studies of auditory-visual  
speech perception  in infants have involved  the comparison  of neural re- 
sponses  (in the form of ERPs) to congruent  versus incongruent  auditory-  
visual syllables  ( Bristow  et al., 2009 ; Kushnerenko  et al., 2008 , 2013 ) 
and short phrases  ( Hyde et al., 2011 ; Reynolds  et al., 2013 ). For exam- 
ple, Kushnerenko  et al. (2008) examined  5-month-olds’  neural process-  
ing of conﬂicting  auditory-visual  syllables  that typically  result in the 
McGurk  eﬀect. Congruent  stimuli consisted  of auditory-visual  /ba/ and 
auditory-visual  /ga/ while incongruent  stimuli consisted  of the McGurk  
eﬀect stimuli (auditory  /ba/ dubbed  onto a visual /ga/ which usually  
results in a “da ”or “𝛿a ”response)  and a conﬂicting  stimulus  (auditory  
/ga/ dubbed  onto a visual /ba/ which usually  results in a combina-  
tion, “bga ”, response).  The ERPs in response  to the conﬂicting  stimulus  
were more positive  over frontal areas and more negative  over temporal  
areas compared  to ERPs in response  to the other stimulus  types, sug- 
gesting that 5-month-olds  detected  the mismatch  between  the auditory  
/ga/ and visual /ba/ but integrated  the auditory  /ba/ and visual /ga/, 
treating  it the same as they did for the integration  of congruent  auditory-  
visual stimuli.  Similar  ﬁndings  were reported  in a study that used short 
phrases.  Hyde et al. (2011) presented  5-month-olds  with an auditory  
recording  of the phrase,  “Oh, hi baby ”, that was either paired with a 
matched  video of a face saying the same phrase or a mismatched  video 
of a face saying a diﬀerent  phrase.  Mean amplitude  of visual N1 and at- 
tentional  Nc components  were more negative  in the asynchronous  than 
the synchronous  condition,  while mean amplitude  of auditory  P2 com- 
ponent was more positive  in the synchronous  than the asynchronous  
condition.  Although  these infant ERP studies provide  some neural level evidence  for auditory-visual  integration  by comparing  neural responses  
to congruent  versus incongruent  auditory-visual  stimuli,  they did not in- 
clude auditory-only  and visual-only  conditions  and so do not truly quan- 
tify auditory-visual  integration  and, in addition,  do not aﬀord compar-  
ison with the modulating  eﬀect of visual information  found in children  
and adults. 
Beyond  electrophysiological  studies,  the hemodynamic  (fNIRS)  ap- 
proach has been used to investigate  infants’  processing  of auditory-  
visual speech ( Altvater-Mackensen  and Grossman,  2016 ; 2018 ). The 
neural responses  of six-month-old  German-learning  infants were en- 
hanced  in the left inferior  frontal regions  when they were presented  with 
matched  auditory-visual  speech as compared  to when they were pre- 
sented with mismatched  auditory-visual  speech ( Alvater-Mackensen  and 
Grossman,  2016 ). A separate  study compared  infants’  processing  of uni- 
modal auditory,  visual, and multimodal  auditory-visual  speech at the 
neural level by presenting  six-month-old  German-learning  infants with 
unimodal  and multimodal  speech stimuli /a/, /e/, and /o/ ( Altvater-  
Mackensen  and Grossman,  2018 ). This study revealed  that the infant 
participants  did not show diﬀerential  responses  to unimodal  and multi- 
modal speech within the frontal regions  and between  hemispheres.  
Taken together,  ERP studies with adults and children  illustrate  that 
auditory-visual  integration  occurs at a neural level and suggest  that 
visual speech information  is beneﬁcial  for speech perception.  In con- 
trast, infant ERP studies demonstrate  only the detection  of a mismatch  
between  auditory  and visual stimuli,  and do not show whether  visual 
speech information  augments  infants’  speech perception,  i.e., whether  
there is an auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt.  The fNIRS approach  used with 
infants did not ﬁnd any diﬀerence  in neural responses  to unimodal  or 
multimodal  speech within frontal regions  In addition  to the paucity  of 
studies investigating  auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt in infants,  a major 
drawback  of these studies in general  is that in order to evoke brain re- 
sponses  they require  presenting  participants  with multiple  repetitions  of 
identical  short stimuli which are averaged  and then compared  between  
conditions.  In the case of auditory-visual  speech perception,  this com- 
prises the use of syllables  or short phrases,  stimuli that are not entirely  
representative  of natural,  conversational  speech.  
A recent approach  addresses  this drawback  by assessing  cortical  
tracking,  or the mathematical  relationship  between  the speech dynam-  
ics and the corresponding  brain responses  (e.g., Ding and Simon, 2012 ; 
Fiedler et al., 2019; Golumbic  et al., 2013 ; Gross et al., 2013; J. 
O’Sullivan  et al., 2014). This approach  has greater ecological  validity  
than ERP approaches,  as it allows the use of continuous  stimuli rather 
than discrete,  repeated  stimuli,  e.g., rather than single words, passages  
that more closely resemble  natural  speech,  such as audiobooks  or pod- 
casts. Accordingly,  this method  has been increasingly  used to examine  
auditory-only  speech perception  in adults (e.g., Ding and Simon, 2013 ; 
Ding et al., 2016 ), children  ( Di Liberto,  Peter, et al., 2018 ; Vander  Ghinst 
et al., 2019 ), and infants (e.g., Jessen et al., 2019 ; Kalashnikova  et al., 
2018 ). Even so, the few studies conducted  with adults so far suggest  that 
cortical  tracking  is augmented  when visual speech information  from a 
speaker’s  talking face is provided  (e.g., Crosse et al., 2015 ; Crosse et al., 
2016 ; O’Sullivan  et al., 2019 ). Importantly,  although  there is evidence  
that cortical  tracking  of speech can be reliably  measured  in children  and 
infants,  whether  cortical  tracking  of auditory-visual  speech is enhanced  
in children  and infants remains  an open question,  one that this paper 
will address.  
The auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt eﬀect rests upon the assumption  
that listeners  attend to a speaker’s  facial movements.  It is thus somewhat  
surprising  that most auditory-visual  speech perception  studies do not 
concurrently  examine  participants’  looking  behaviour  to the speaker’s  
face (although  see Foxe et al., 2015 ). It has been shown that while 
the eyes convey emotional  and social information,  the mouth trans- 
lates information  closely related to the temporal  and acoustic  proper-  
ties of speech ( Yehia et al., 1998 ). Face viewing  studies indicate  that 
humans  are cognisant  of the various  types of information  that diﬀer- 
ent facial features  provide  and will shift their gaze from one facial

region to another  accordingly  (e.g., Buchan  et al., 2008 ; Lansing  and 
McConkie,  1999 ). This attentional  shift is observed  even in infants as 
young as 6 months  ( Tenenbaum  et al., 2013 ). In addition,  idiosyncratic  
diﬀerences  between  individuals  in facial scanning  patterns  of the eye 
and mouth regions  are related to perceptual  performance  ( Gurler et al., 
2015 ; Mehoudar  et al., 2014 ; Peterson  and Eckstein,  2012 ). For instance,  
Gurler et al. (2015) found that individuals  who report experiencing  the 
McGurk  eﬀect more frequently  also spend a larger proportion  of time 
ﬁxating  on the speaker’s  mouth.  This ﬁnding  points toward the strong 
likelihood  that individuals’  idiosyncratic  preferences  in their ﬁxation  of 
the speaker’s  mouth or eyes will inﬂuence  the extent to which visual 
speech information  augments  their speech perception.  
Interindividual  variations  in looking  behaviour  to the speaker’s  face 
may result in subtle but signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  in speech perception.  
For example,  the opening  and closing of the mouth corresponds  to the 
syllabic  timescale  of auditory  speech ( Chandrasekaran  et al., 2009 ), 
thus providing  the richness  of redundant  cues relating  to the start and 
end points of syllables  that may augment  speech perception,  especially  
for listeners  who ﬁxate on the speaker’s  mouth region. This pertains  
particularly  to young infants in normal  listening  conditions  because  
they are just beginning  to acquire  a language  system.  In this regard, 
Lewkowicz  and Hansen-Tift  (2012) provided  evidence  of a developmen-  
tal trend in looking  behaviour:  infants move away from preferential  at- 
tention  to the speaker’s  eye region to attending  more to the speaker’s  
mouth region sometime  between  4 and 8 months,  and then back to at- 
tending  more to the speaker’s  eye region by 12 months  of age. As this 
pattern  coincides  with the developmental  timeline  of speech production  
( Imafuku  et al., 2019 ), the researchers  propose  that the initial eye-to- 
mouth attentional  shift reﬂects  infants’  attempt  to extract the redundant  
cues present  in auditory-visual  speech while the second attentional  shift 
converges  with adults’ looking  behaviour  to a talking face and suggests  
some level of language  expertise  that reduces  the need to focus specif- 
ically on the speaker’s  mouth ( Lewkowicz  and Hansen-Tift,  2012 ). No- 
tably, relative  attention  to a talker’s  mouth at 6 months  is positively  
related to expressive  language  skills both then ( Tsang et al., 2018 ) and 
at 18 months  ( Young et al., 2009 ), and to receptive  vocabulary  at 12 
months  ( Imafuku  and Myowa,  2016 ). Failure to attend to the speaker’s  
mouth is associated  with later language  learning  disorders  ( Pons et al., 
2019 ). Adults, by comparison,  are proﬁcient  language  users and instead  
focus more on the talker’s  eye region under optimal  listening  conditions  
but will increasingly  direct their attention  to the talker’s  mouth as lis- 
tening situations  become  more challenging,  such as when there is back- 
ground  noise (e.g., Buchan  et al., 2008 ; Stacey et al., 2020 ; Vatikiotis-  
Bateson  et al., 1998 ). These ﬁndings  raise the possibility  that individ-  
uals’ idiosyncratic  diﬀerences  in looking  patterns  to a talking face will 
inﬂuence  the degree of auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt experienced.  In- 
vestigating  whether  this is indeed the case forms the second aim of this 
study. 
1.1. This study and the hypotheses  
To examine  whether  cortical  tracking  of auditory-visual  speech is 
enhanced  in infants and children,  and whether  gaze behaviour  modu- 
lates the extent of auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt,  EEG and gaze data 
were simultaneously  recorded  as 5-month-old  and 4-year-old  partici-  
pants watched  short clips of a speaker  in auditory-only  (AO), visual- 
only (VO), and auditory-visual  (AV) presentation  modes. AO presenta-  
tions consisted  of still photos of the speaker’s  face paired with auditory  
recordings,  VO presentations  consisted  of silent videos of the speaker  
talking,  and AV presentations  consisted  of both the videos and the au- 
ditory recordings.  As this paradigm  has been used previously  with adult 
participants  ( Crosse et al., 2015 ; Crosse et al., 2016 a, 2016 b), a group 
of adults was tested as a control.  
Behavioural  studies illustrate  that the auditory-visual  speech bene- 
ﬁt is evident  across development.  Neurophysiological  studies show the 
same for children  (using ERPs) and adults (using ERPs and cortical  track- ing), while none have yet directly  examined  the auditory-visual  speech 
beneﬁt in infants.  Even so, ERP studies with infants that investigated  
their detection  of auditory-visual  asynchrony  coupled  with behavioural  
ﬁndings  suggest  that the auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt may also be ev- 
ident at the neurophysiological  level in infants.  
With these considerations  in mind, we hypothesise  that, across the 
three age groups,  (1) cortical  tracking  of the speech envelope  will be 
most accurate  during AV presentations,  followed  by AO then VO pre- 
sentations,  and (2) auditory-visual  speech beneﬁt will be evident  as in- 
dexed by the additive  criterion  [i.e., AV > ( A + V )]. Next, facial scan- 
ning and speech perception  ﬁndings  suggest  that gaze behaviour  may 
modulate  cortical  tracking  accuracy  diﬀerently  for infants compared  to 
children  and adults. At ﬁve months,  infants are likely to be in the pro- 
cess of shifting  their attentional  focus from the speaker’s  eyes to the 
speaker’s  mouth region ( Lewkowicz  and Hansen-Tift,  2012 ; Pons et al., 
2015 ). Furthermore,  5-month-olds  are in the process  of acquiring  lan- 
guage and may beneﬁt from any additional  information  that can be ex- 
tracted from visual speech cues. Accordingly,  we hypothesise  that the 
proportion  of time that infants spend attending  to the speaker’s  mouth 
will be positively  correlated  with cortical  tracking  accuracy  when visual 
speech information  is available,  i.e., during VO and AV presentations.  
On the other hand, the same positive  correlation  is not expected  for 
4-year-olds  and adults, given previous  ﬁndings  that older children  and 
adults focus more on the speaker’s  eyes when the auditory  speech signal 
is clear (e.g., Lewkowicz  and Hansen-Tift,  2012 ), presumably  because  
the acoustic  properties  from the auditory  signal are suﬃcient  for speech 
perception  and they turn to the eyes to seek out emotional  and social 
information  that may not be conveyed  as clearly by auditory  speech.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Five-month-olds  : A ﬁnal sample of eighteen  5-month-old  infants 
from Australian  English  monolingual  backgrounds  were included  (M 
age = 5.49 months,  SD = 0.30 months,  8 females).  This sample size 
was decided  upon by drawing  on previous  neurophysiological  stud- 
ies that investigated  infant neural processing  of AV asynchrony  (e.g., 
Hyde et al., 2011 ; Kushnerenko  et al., 2008 ; Reynolds  et al., 2013 ) and 
compared  children’s  and adults’ neural processing  of AV speech (e.g., 
Kaganovich  and Schumaker,  2014 ; Knowland  et al., 2014 ). An addi- 
tional 20 babies were tested but excluded  because  of fussiness  ( n = 6), 
excessively  noisy EEG recordings  ( n = 11), or insuﬃcient  gaze data 
( n = 3). The attrition  rate in this study is not uncommon  for infant 
EEG studies (e.g., deBoer et al., 2007 ; Hyde et al., 2011 ; Reynolds  et al., 
2013 ). All infants came from a monolingual  Australian  English-speaking  
background.  
Four-year-olds  : A ﬁnal sample of 19 Australian  English  monolingual  
4-year-olds  were included  (M age = 4.16 years, SD = 0.14 years, 12 
females).  An additional  14 children  were tested but excluded  because  
they were very ﬁdgety and did not complete  the experiment  ( n = 5), 
had excessively  noisy EEG recordings  ( n = 3), or had insuﬃcient  gaze 
data ( n = 7). 
Adults : A ﬁnal sample of 18 Australian  English  monolingual  adults 
aged between  18 and 56 years were included  (M age = 2",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5028, 5031), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(18245, 18247), match='3.'>"

2.1. Participants  
The data included  here were collected  from individuals  who par- 
ticipated  in one or more previously  published  EEG studies in our 
lab ( James, Strunk,  Arndt, & Duarte,  2016 ; Mirjalili  et al., 2021 ; 
Powell,  Strunk,  James, Polyn, & Duarte,  2018 ; Strunk,  James, Arndt, 
& Duarte,  2017 ). The participants  consisted  of 65 right-handed  adults 
(26 women),  ages 18-74. All subjects  were native English  speakers  and 
had normal  or corrected  vision. Participants  were compensated  with 
course credit or $10/hour  and were recruited  from the Georgia  Insti- 
tute of Technology  and surrounding  community.  None of the partici-  
pants reported  any psychiatric  or neurological  disorders,  vascular  dis- 
ease, or using any medications  that aﬀect the central nervous  system.  
Participants  completed  a standardized  neurological  battery  of neuropsy-  
chological  tests which consists  of subtests  from the memory  assessment  
scale ( Williams,  1991 ), including  list learning,  verbal span forward  and 
backwards,  recognition,  visual recognition,  immediate  and delayed  re- 
call, recall, reproduction,  and delayed  recognition.  Participants  were ex- 
cluded if their scores were above or below two standard  deviations  of the 
group mean. Furthermore,  older adults were administered  the Montreal  
Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA)  ( Nasreddine  et al., 2005 ) to test further 
for mild cognitive  impairments.  Participants  scoring  less than 26 on the 
MoCA were excluded.  All participants  signed consent  forms approved  
by the Georgia  Institute  of Technology  Institutional  Review  Board. Five 
older participants  (61-76 years) were excluded  in this study: two for 
noisy EEG (i.e., DC drift, movement),  two for not understanding  the 
task procedures,  and one for computer  malfunction.  
2.2. Stimuli 
Four hundred  thirty-two  grayscale  images of objects were chosen 
from the Hemera  Technologies  Photo-Object  DVDs and Google images.  
During encoding,  288 of these objects were presented.  Each grayscale  
object was presented  on the center of the screen with white background.  
Scenes and color squares  were presented  to the left or right of the object. 
The locations  of the context  features  (i.e., color or scene) were counter-  
balanced  across blocks so that they were shown an equal number  of 
times on the left and right across subjects.  The scenes included  color pho- tos of a studio apartment,  cityscape,  or island. The colored  squares  were 
green, brown, or red. Each of the context  and object pictures  spanned  
a maximum  vertical  and horizontal  visual angle of approximately  3°. 
At retrieval,  all 288 objects were included  in the memory  test as well 
as 144 new object images that were not shown during encoding.  Study 
and test items were counterbalanced  across subjects.

2.7. Statistical  analysis  
2.7.1. Descriptive  analyses  
Descriptive  statistics  were computed  with IBM SPSS Statistics  soft- 
ware version  26.0. Gaussian  distribution  was conﬁrmed  by the Shapiro-  
Wilk’s test ( 𝛼< 0.05), histograms,  and QQ plots for both female and 
male participants.  Group diﬀerences  of normally  distributed  data were 
analyzed  by parametric  tests (unpaired  t -test, 2-tailed).  Non ‐Gaussian  
distributed  variables  were assessed  by Mann ‐Whitney  U test ( 𝛼< 0.05). 
Spearman’s  correlations  ( 𝛼< 0.05 uncorrected,  𝛼< 0.0005 Bonferroni  cor- 
rected) between  clinical  scores were tested in the entire sample,  as well 
as in female and male participants  separately.  
2.7.2. Statistics  for metabolites  
SPSS was used for statistical  testing of metabolite  ratios (i.e., Cho/Cr,  
Naa/Cho,  Naa/Cr).  Gray matter fractions  in the ROIs were calculated  
with gray matter/(gray  matter + WM) for each subject.  This ratio is cere- 
brospinal  ﬂuid-independent  and can account  for possible  diﬀerences  of 
metabolite  concentrations  in gray and white matter.  Fractions  in the 
ROI voxels were assessed  by t -test for diﬀerences  between  female and 
male participants.  Then, the relationships  between  metabolite  ratios in 
the ROIs were evaluated  in the entire sample (Spearman,  𝛼< 0.05 un- 
corrected,  𝛼< 0.001 Bonferroni  corrected).  Then, group diﬀerences  were 
calculated  using the Mann-Whitney  U test ( 𝛼< 0.05). 
Next, the relationships  between  all neurometabolite  ratios with clin- 
ical scores (i.e., B5T, RS, PSS-10,  RSES, H-Scale,  GSI) were studied  using 
Spearman’s  correlation  ( 𝛼< 0.05 uncorrected,  𝛼< 0.0008 Bonferroni  cor- 
rected) in the entire group, as well as in female and male participants  
separately.  
In addition,  stepwise  multiple  regression  analysis  was used to test 
for signiﬁcant  predictors  of the B5T model by itself and together  with 
the other behavioural  measures  on the metabolite  ratios in the entire 
sample,  as well as in female and male participants  separately.  Models  
that could predict the metabolite  ratios with R 2 ≥ 0.30 and which sur- 
vived multiple  testing (Bonferroni)  adjusted  to 𝛼< 0.01 and 𝛼< 0.005, 
accordingly,  were considered.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(22224, 22243), match=' Data availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(2488, 2494), match='  \n3. '>"

tions ( Kuang and Schmah,  2019 ). Therefore,  deformable  image regis- 
tration has become  a research  focus of recent medical  image registra-  
tion studies ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ; Fan et al., 2019 ; Dalca et al., 
2019 ; Wang and Zhang, 2020 ; Cao et al., 2018 ; Mok and Chung, 2020 ; 
Kuang and Schmah,  2019 ). 
For deformable  medical  image registration,  traditional  methods  
are based on image features/intensity  and can be summarized  as an 
optimization  problem  ( Andersson  et al., 2007 ; Avants et al., 2009 ; 
Klein et al., 2009 ; Lorenzi  et al., 2013 ; Ou et al., 2011 ). These 
optimization-based  registration  methods  (ORs) generally  deﬁne a hy- 
pothesis  space of possible  spatial transformations  and deﬁne similar-  
ity metrics  between  ﬁxed and moving  images.  Then, the maximum  
of the similarity  metrics  is found by iteratively  optimizing/updating  
the spatial transformation.  However,  such pairwise  (target-pair-speciﬁc)  
optimization  is computationally  expensive  ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ; 
Balakrishnan  et al., 2018 ) and it may take several hours to register  a 
pair of images with CPUs ( Klein et al., 2009 ; Fischl, 2012 ). Recent GPU 
implementations  of ORs has reduced  the runtime  to minutes  but still 
not within the range of real-time  registration  ( Modat et al., 2010 ). Fur- 
thermore,  registration  accuracy  of ORs is still unsatisfactory  for clinical  
practice.  Even state-of-the-art  ORs, such as SyN (Symmetric  Normaliza-  
tion method)  ( Avants et al., 2009 ) and DRAMMS  (Deformable  Registra-  
tion via Attribute  Matching  and Mutual-Saliency  weighting)  ( Ou et al., 
2011 ), are prone to errors in diﬃcult  brain registration  studies.  
Deep learning-based  registration  methods  (DLRs) have been pro- 
posed recently  for medical  images.  Compared  to traditional  ORs, DLRs 
have higher or competitive  registration  accuracy.  DLRs adopt an end- 
to-end neural network  to directly  predict a spatial transformation  in a 
single pass ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ; de Vos et al., 2019 ; Fan et al., 
2019 ; Sokooti  et al., 2017 ; Balakrishnan  et al., 2018 ). A key advan- 
tage of DLRs is the computational  eﬃciency  that is several orders of 
magnitude  faster than ORs. DLRs can register  a pair of images within a 
minute using CPUs or within a second using GPUs ( Balakrishnan  et al., 
2019 ; de Vos et al., 2019 ; Fan et al., 2019 ; Balakrishnan  et al., 2018 ). 
DLRs achieve  this by discarding  the target-pair-speciﬁc  optimization  
that is inherent  in ORs and instead  rely on a globally  optimized  network  
that is trained  with a set of training  samples.  However,  compared  to 
the target-pair-speciﬁc  optimization,  globally  optimized  networks  inher- 
ently have degraded  adaptability  to variations  in testing samples.  This 
limitation  is severe for registering  medical  images with large appearance  
variations,  especially  since few existing  DLRs explicitly  take into ac- 
count appearance  variations.  Consequently,  the performance  of existing  
DLRs degrades  markedly  when they are applied  to unseen ﬁxed/moving  
image pairs whose appearances  are observably  diﬀerent  (e.g., Fig. 1 a 
and b). 
In this study, we overcome  this limitation  through  an Appearance  
Adjustment  Network  (AAN). We suggest  that our method  is the ﬁrst 
to enhances  DLRs for medical  images via automatic  appearance  adjust- 
ment. Our AAN is designed  to be readily inserted  into a wide range 
Fig. 1. Examples  of transaxial  MRI slices of (a) ﬁxed and (b) moving images. 
The image appearances  of (a) and (b) are observably  diﬀerent.  In (c) we show 
the result after appearance  adjustment  of (b), and (d) shows the appearance  
transformation  between  (b) and (c). The appearance  transformation  (d) turns 
(b) into (c), making (c)’s image appearance  similar to (a) while preserving  the 
anatomical  structures  in (b). of existing  DLRs to reduce the appearance  diﬀerences  between  ﬁxed 
and moving  images.  It performs  a high-quality  nonlinear  tissue-intensity  
mapping,  which takes a ﬁxed/moving  image pair and an automatically-  
extracted  anatomy  edge map as the input and then predicts  an appear-  
ance transformation  (e.g., Fig. 1 d) to adjust the moving  image’s  ap- 
pearance.  Through  a novel anatomy-constrained  loss function  based on 
the anatomy  edge map, the AAN can make the moving  image’s  appear-  
ance approach  the ﬁxed image’s  appearance  while retaining  its original  
anatomical  structures  (e.g., Fig. 1 b and c). In doing so, the AAN can en- 
hance the adaptability  of DLRs to appearance  variations.  Our AAN also 
enables  DLRs to focus on learning  spatial transformations  by suppress-  
ing the appearance  variations  in image pairs so that it can increase  the 
learning  eﬃciency  of DLRs and reduce the requirement  for the number  
of training  samples.  
Our AAN was motivated  by the methods  proposed  by Uzunova  et al. 
(2017) and Zhao et al. (2019) . Uzunova  et al. (2017) leveraged  existing  
appearance  variations  and built a statistical  appearance  model from a 
few training  samples  to perform  data augmentation  for DLRs. Zhao et al. 
(2019) trained  two separate  convolutional  neural networks  (CNNs)  to 
estimate  spatial and appearance  transformations  between  a ﬁxed atlas 
image and other images.  Then, cross-combinations  derived  from the es- 
timated  spatial and appearance  transformations  are applied  to the ﬁxed 
atlas image to synthesize  new training  samples  for deep learning-based  
medical  image segmentation.  We also use a neural network  (i.e., AAN) 
to estimate  the appearance  transformations  between  the ﬁxed and mov- 
ing images and assemble  it with existing  DLRs. However,  in contrast  
to the studies of Uzunova  et al. (2017) and Zhao et al. (2019) that in- 
volved laborious  augmentation  of the variations  in training  samples  to 
improve  the network’s  adaptability  to the appearance  variations  in un- 
seen testing samples,  our AAN reduces  the appearance  variations  in both 
training  and testing samples,  which enables  DLRs to focus on learning  
spatial transformations.  
We evaluated  our AAN with three state-of-the-art  DLRs - Voxel- 
morph (VM) ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ), Diﬀeomorphic  Voxelmorph  
(DifVM)  ( Dalca et al., 2019 ), and Laplacian  Pyramid  Image Regis- 
tration Network  (LapIRN)  ( Mok and Chung, 2020 ) - on three well- 
benchmarked  datasets  of 3D brain magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) 
- IBSR18  ( Internet  Brain Segmentation  Repository  (IBSR) ), Mindbog-  
gle101 ( Klein and Tourville,  2012 ), and LPBA40  ( Shattuck  et al., 2008 ). 
The experimental  results show that our AAN can generate  consistent  
improvements  in registration  accuracy  and training  eﬃciency.

2.1. Deep learning-based  medical  image registration  
Existing  DLRs use deep neural networks  to directly  learn a complex  
mapping  from a pair of ﬁxed/moving  images to a spatial transformation.  
Supervised  DLRs trained  a network  using pairs of ﬁxed/moving  images 
as input and ground  truth transformations  as labels ( Sokooti  et al., 2017 ; 
Cao, 2017 ; Miao et al., 2016 ; Wang and Zhang, 2020 ; Yang et al., 2017 ; 
Cao et al., 2018 ). Ground  truth transformations,  however,  are usually  
diﬃcult  to acquire,  and thus ﬂawed transformations  measured  by tradi- 
tional ORs were used as ground  truth labels in some studies ( Fan et al., 
2019 ; Cao, 2017 ; Wang and Zhang, 2020 ; Cao et al., 2018 ), which intro- 
duced inherited  registration  errors. Alternatively,  synthetic  image pairs 
with ground  truth transformations  can be used, but the synthetic  data 
have to be carefully  designed  so as to resemble  the real data ( Zhao et al., 
2019 ). 
Weakly-supervised  DLRs removed  the reliance  on ground  truth trans- 
formations  by incorporating  manually  depicted  anatomy  labels and 
have shown improved  performance  in registration  accuracy  ( Hu et al., 
2018 ; Lee et al., 2019 ; Hu et al., 2019 ; Hu, 2018 ). The manual  deriva- 
tion of anatomy  labels, however,  is time-consuming.  Besides,  weakly-  
supervised  DLRs train a network  based on the similarity  between  the 
anatomy  masks of ﬁxed and moving  images,  where the anatomy  mask 
2  M. Meng, L. Bi, M. Fulham et al. NeuroImage  259 (2022) 119444 
of the moving  image is warped  to be spatially  aligned  to the ﬁxed im- 
age’s mask. This means that the network  learns to align the labeled  
regions  rather than to register  all image pixels, and hence exposing  
the pixels in the periphery  of the labeled  regions  to registration  errors 
( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ). In addition,  similar to supervised  DLRs, the 
registration  accuracy  of weakly-supervised  DLRs is still bounded  by the 
quality of anatomy  labels. 
Unsupervised  DLRs have been proposed  to eliminate  the reliance  of 
DLRs on label information  ( de Vos et al., 2019 ; Balakrishnan  et al., 2018 ; 
Dalca et al., 2019 ; Mok and Chung, 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2019 ). Unsuper-  
vised DLRs train a network  to minimize  dissimilarity  metrics  such as 
intensity  Mean Squared  Error (MSE) between  the ﬁxed and moving  im- 
ages. Unsupervised  DLRs are considered  more promising,  compared  to 
supervised  counterparts,  because  synthetic  or inaccurate  label informa-  
tion are not incorporated  into the network’s  training.  Recently,  unsu- 
pervised  DLRs tend to decouple  the complex  registration  process  into 
multiple  steps, and this has been demonstrated  to improve  the registra-  
tion accuracy  ( Hu et al., 2019 ; Mok and Chung, 2020 ). For example,  
Hu et al. ( Hu et al., 2019 ) proposed  a Dual-stream  Pyramid  Registration  
Network  (Dual-PRNet)  that decouples  feature learning  from transforma-  
tion optimization.  Mok et al. ( Mok and Chung, 2020 ) proposed  a Lapla- 
cian Pyramid  Image Registration  Network  (LapIRN),  which decouples  
the registration  process  with 3-level pyramid  networks  and achieved  the 
top-performance  at the 2021 Learn2Reg  challenge  ( Hering et al., 2021 ). 
The limitations  associated  with the availability  of ground  truth la- 
bels have been largely mitigated  by unsupervised  DLRs, but DLRs re- 
tain another  key limitation  in their reliance  on using globally  optimized  
networks.  As mentioned  above, globally  optimized  networks  inherently  
have degraded  adaptability  to variations  in unseen testing samples.  In 
some studies ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ; Lee et al., 2019 ), test-speciﬁc  
iterative  reﬁnement  was incorporated  into DLRs to overcome  this lim- 
itation,  where the trained  network  is ﬁne-tuned  individually  for each 
testing image pair. It is worth noting that iteratively-reﬁned  DLRs per- 
formed  better than non-iterative  (one-pass)  counterparts  but at a higher 
computational  complexity,  thus reducing  the advantage  of DLRs on com- 
putational  eﬃciency.  
In this study, in contrast  to using test-speciﬁc  iterative  reﬁnements,  
we propose  an AAN to enhance  the adaptability  of DLRs to appearance  
variations.  We focus on inserting  the AAN into non-iterative  unsuper-  
vised DLRs that remove  the reliance  on using test-speciﬁc  reﬁnements  
and data labels for training.  
2.2. Appearance  variations  
Although  many investigators  have focused  on the DLR’s network  ar- 
chitectures,  loss functions,  and learning  schemes,  there are few stud- 
ies that have investigated  on the appearance  variations  that are ap- 
parent in medical  images.  Normalized  cross-correlation,  an intensity-  
robust loss function,  is considered  more robust to appearance  variations  
( Avants et al., 2009 ), but it is unable to completely  resolve appear-  
ance variations  as demonstrated  in our experiments  ( Section  5 ). Tra- 
ditional  histogram  matching/equalization  is considered  to be a help- 
ful preprocessing  step to reduce appearance  variations  ( Shapira  et al., 
2013 ; Garg and Jain, 2017 ). However,  these methods  are unable to han- 
dle the variations  beyond  the histogram  diﬀerences  such as the vari- 
ations in tissue texture and image noise. In addition,  data augmenta-  
tion can improve  the network’s  adaptability  to appearance  variations  
( Uzunova  et al., 2017 ; Zhao et al., 2019 ), but the generation  of syn- 
thetic data is time-consuming  and has to be carefully  designed  so that 
the synthetic  data could have realistic  appearance.  
Metamorphosis  is a concept  that can be applied  to image registra-  
tion. Traditional  metamorphosis  methods  jointly estimate  a space de- 
formation  and an appearance  change to construct  a spatio-temporal  tra- 
jectory that morphs  a source image to a target image, where appear-  
ance changes  are modeled  as transformation  variables  via image simi- 
larity metrices  ( Niethammer  et al., 2011 ; Richardson  and Younes,  2013 ). Recently,  François  et al. (2021) proposed  combining  metamorpho-  
sis and Large Deformation  Diﬀeomorphic  Metric Mapping  (LDDMM)  
for optimization-based  image registration.  Bône et al. (2020) intro- 
duced metamorphosis  into deep learning  and proposed  a metamor-  
phic auto-encoder  for shape analysis,  which jointly learns shape and 
appearance  representations.  Metamorphosis,  however,  has yet to be 
introduced  to DLRs. Although  we have mentioned  that some DLRs 
decoupled  registration  to some degree ( Hu et al., 2019 ; Mok and 
Chung, 2020 )( Section  2.1 ), few DLRs decouple  appearance  transforma-  
tions from image registration.  Our AAN follows  a similar concept  to 
metamorphosis,  where we model the appearance  transformations  be- 
tween the ﬁxed and moving  images to enhance  DLRs. It should be noted, 
nevertheless,  that we still focus on image registration  where moving  im- 
ages are warped  (not morphed)  into ﬁxed images.  Therefore,  the appear-  
ance transformations  (produced  by the AAN) are used only to reduce 
appearance  variations,  enabling  DLRs to obtain more accurate  spatial 
transformations,  but they are not used to transform  moving  images as 
ﬁnal registration  results.  
A similar architecture  of inserting  Image Transformer  Networks  
(ITNs) into Spatial Transformer  Networks  (STNs) was proposed  by 
Lee et al. (2019) . In their study, the ITNs extracted  Structures-of-  
Interests  (SoIs), such as segmentation  or landmarks,  and removed  un- 
labeled  regions,  thereby  markedly  narrowing  the registration  space for 
the STNs. Therefore,  the registration  performance  is reliant on the avail- 
ability of SoI labels. Our AAN, in contrast,  reduces  appearance  variations  
by adjusting  image appearance,  through  which we further leverage  the 
information  in image appearance  without  the need of supplementary  
information  oﬀered by anatomy  labels.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5511, 5514), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(15291, 15295), match=' \n3.'>"

activity,  and dietary practices  ( Virani et al., 2021 ). These risk factors are 
less a product  of sex than of socially  gendered  habits and experiences,  
as demonstrated  by Pelletier  et al. (2016) , who investigated  the asso- 
ciation using a novel composite  measure  of gender characteristics.  On 
average,  the risk of recurrent  premature  acute coronary  syndrome  (ACS) 
was no diﬀerent  between  males and females;  however,  higher feminine  
scores in both males and females  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with recurrent  
ACS, indicating  that gendered  attributes  are more predictive  of coronary  
outcomes  than binary sex. 
Brain-related  disorders  seem especially  likely to be inﬂuenced  by 
gendered  experience,  given the lifelong  plasticity  of neural structures  
and circuitry  ( Voss et al., 2017 ). Many psychiatric  diseases,  including  
anorexia  nervosa  ( Smink et al., 2012 ), depression  ( Martin et al., 2013 ; 
Belle & Doucet,  2003 ), anxiety  ( Ferlatte  et al., 2020 ), conduct  disor- 
der ( Helgeland  et al., 2005 ), and substance  use disorders  (Brady et al., 
1999 ), are shaped by cultural  and environmental  factors that diﬀer by 
gender ( Rosenﬁeld  & Mouzon,  2013 ). However,  studies of the brain have 
barely scratched  the surface in exploring  the impact of gender attributes  
on structural  and functional  measures.  An exception  is the growing  num- 
ber of studies comparing  the brains of transgender  and cisgender  partic- 
ipants, which we address  elsewhere  ( Fleres et al., 2021 ), but have the 
same limitation  of treating  gender as binary and are problematic  due to 
the unique minority  stressors  endured  by transgender  people ( Mueller  et 
al., 2017 ) and stigmatizing  assumptions  about this population  ( DuBois 
and Shattuck-Heidorn,  2021 ). 
To assess the state of this research,  we searched  the brain imaging  lit- 
erature  for studies that have used any type of non-binary  “gender  ”mea- 
sure as independent  variables  for testing brain/behavior  relationships.  
We uncovered  two distinct  approaches.  One involves  administering  gen- 
der self-assessment  surveys  to a mix of male and female participants,  
producing  measures  of gender expression  that are then used as indepen-  
dent variables  in image analyses.  The second has focused  on mapping  
brain measures  to one speciﬁc  axis of gender expression,  internalizing  
versus externalizing  behaviors.  Both approaches  have signiﬁcant  limita- 
tions but demonstrate  the feasibility  and promise  of including  gender,  
along with sex, when assessing  brain-behavior  relationships.  
Literature  search 
We performed  an initial PubMed  search to identify  the most com- 
monly used scales for operationalizing  “gender.  ”We identiﬁed  11 such 
inventories,  which we then used in combination  with brain imaging  
terms to conduct  a systematic  literature  search (Suppl.  Figure 1). Out of 
221 initial hits, we found eight studies that partitioned  brain MRI par- 
ticipants  using non-binary  measures  of gender as an independent  vari- 
able. Midway  through  this review,  we became  aware of a systematic  
survey ( Nielsen  et al., 2021 ) that identiﬁed  31 diﬀerent  instruments  for 
assessing  gender-related  traits, including  4 of our original  11. We sub- 
sequently  added these 27 additional  inventories  to our PubMed  search, 
which increased  the hits to 455 but uncovered  no additional  brain imag- 
ing studies.  
Of the 38 total gender inventories  in our search, we found six have 
been used in conjunction  with brain imaging  (Suppl.  Table 1). Most in- 
clude separate  “masculine  ”and “feminine  ”scales,  recognizing  that these 
are distinct  behavioral  clusters  and not poles of a single continuum.  Al- 
though several of these scales are decades  old and have not been vali- 
dated across diverse  populations,  we did not exclude  any from this pilot 
analysis.  Through  other literature  review,  we also found three recent 
imaging  studies taking a reverse  approach,  identifying  nonbinary  brain 
correlates  of gendered  behavior,  which we added as the second part of 
our analysis.  
Results  
Of the eight brain imaging  studies using non-binary  gender as 
an independent  variable,  four were focused  on structural  measures  ( Table 1A ) and four on functional  MRI ( Table 1B ). In the structural  set, 
two studies by Wood et al. found volume  correlates  with “femininity  ”in 
the straight  gyrus (SG) of the orbitofrontal  cortex. The ﬁrst, small study 
by Wood et al. (2008a)  found that larger SG size correlated  with higher 
identiﬁcation  with feminine  characteristics  and better performance  on 
a test of social cognition,  regardless  of sex, where gender attributes  
were collapsed  into a single masculine-feminine  continuum  using the 
Personal  Attributes  Questionnaire  (PAQ). In the second study, children  
aged 7-17 were similarly  assessed  on a single continuum  using the Chil- 
dren’s Sex Role Inventory  (CSRI),  and Wood et al. (2008b)  found that 
higher “femininity  ”was associated  with a smaller SG, but only in girls. 
(This opposite  ﬁnding  from adults was speculated  to reﬂect girls’ ear- 
lier entry into the pruning  phase of cortical  development.)  In the third 
study, Belﬁet al. (2014) also used the CSRI. They found that frontal lobe 
white matter correlated  with higher “masculinity  ”a n d temporal  lobe 
gray matter correlated  with higher “femininity  ”in all children  aged 7-17 
years. Most recently,  Pletzer (2019) reported  a correlation  between  self- 
reported  femininity  and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) volume  in men 
but not women.  However,  this study failed to ﬁnd a brain structural  rela- 
tionship  with the more comprehensive  Gender-Related  Attributes  Scale 
(GERAS)  in either sex. Taken together,  these four structural  MRI stud- 
ies provide  preliminary  evidence  that regional  cortical  volumes  can be 
modulated  by gender attributes,  especially  in the frontal lobe. 
Turning  to the four functional  MRI studies ( Table 1B ), one failed 
to ﬁnd a relationship  between  gender attributes  and brain activation,  
but the others reported  a moderating  or direct eﬀect of gender mea- 
sures on regional  activity  or connectivity.  The earliest  of these studies 
( Marchewka  et al., 2012 ) found no eﬀect of gender role, assessed  with 
a Polish version  of the widely-used  Bem Sex Role Inventory  (BSRI), 
on fMRI activation  to a task involving  deliberate  lying. By contrast,  
Lungu et al. (2015) found that both female sex and higher femininity  
(assessed  using the Feminine  Gender  Role Stress survey,  FGRS) were as- 
sociated  with lower connectivity  between  the right amygdala  and me- 
dial prefrontal  cortex during the processing  of negative  emotion,  with 
the eﬀect larger and more signiﬁcant  for measures  of gender than binary 
sex. More recently,  Compère  et al. (2021) looked at brain activation  dur- 
ing autobiographical  memory  tasks and found that BSRI-assessed  mas- 
culinity,  but not sex, was associated  with greater activity  in the left an- 
gular gyrus. Similarly,  Du et al. (2021) found no sex diﬀerence  in activity  
in a resting reward network  but did ﬁnd scattered  associations  between  
BSRI masculinity  and femininity  within this network  in both men and 
women.  While still quite preliminary,  these studies suggest  that non- 
binary gender measures  may explain  some of the individual  variance  in 
functional  brain circuits,  apart from or in addition  to binary sex eﬀects. 
During this review,  we became  aware of a complementary,  
discovery-science  approach  for incorporating  gender spectra  in the anal- 
ysis of brain imaging  data. In each of the three studies ( Table 2 ), multi- 
modal sex diﬀerences  were identiﬁed  within large imaging  databases  
and then used to construct  a continuous  spectrum  of sex-related  at- 
tributes.  This brain spectrum  was then mapped  to two dimensions  of 
masculine-feminine  psychological  diﬀerence,  internalizing  and exter- 
nalizing  behaviors.  Such behaviors  are of interest  because  they under- 
lie two clusters  of psychiatric  diagnoses  with opposing  gender preva- 
lence: internalizing  disorders,  including  depression  and anxiety,  are 
more prevalent  in females;  externalizing  disorders,  such as antisocial  
and substance  use disorders,  are more prevalent  in males ( Kramer  et al., 
2008 ). 
In the ﬁrst study to take this approach,  Phillips  et al. (2019) con- 
structed  a “continuous  brain sex diﬀerentiation  score ”b a s e d  on mul- 
timodal  structural  and diﬀusion  brain MRI measures  in 866 U.S. ado- 
lescents.  This composite  spectrum  was found to correlate  with exter- 
nalizing  behavior,  albeit only in the male cohort. In the next study, 
( Vosberg  et al., 2021 ) combined  48 diﬀerent  physiological  and anthro-  
pomorphic  measures  (including  several brain measures)  to calculate  
a “continuous  sex score ”a c r o s s  a population  of 1,029 Canadian  ado- 
lescents.  This continuous  score correlated  positively  with internalizing

Each study constructed  a sex/gender  continuum  based on composite  brain ± bodily measures  across a large population.  This continuum  was then correlated  with 
measures  of internalizing  and externalizing  behavior,  key dimensions  of psychological  gender diﬀerence.  
and negatively  with externalizing  behavior  in both males and females  
after puberty  and notably  explained  more of the variance  in inter- 
nalizing  and externalizing  behaviors  than binary sex. Most recently,  
Zhang et al. (2021) combined  fMRI connectivity  data from four interna-  
tional databases  (N = 9,620) to construct  a “brain gender continuum  ”of 
resting functional  networks.  They then tested this continuum  against  in- 
ternalizing  and externalizing  measures  available  in one of the databases  
(N = 719). They found that it best ﬁt in a U-shaped  curve to internalizing  
score, suggesting  that the lowest risk of anxiety  and depression  lies in 
the middle or androgynous  zone of the brain gender spectrum.  Together,  
these three “big data ”studies  demonstrate  that brain-behavior  relation-  
ships may be more fruitfully  uncovered  using non-binary  sex/gender  
measures  compared  to the simple separation  of subjects  by binary sex. 
Limitations  and future directions  
Given the complexity  of human gender,  brain diﬀerences  between  
males and females  are widely recognized  as more than a product  of bi- 
nary sex. But how can neuroimagers  address  this experimentally?  We 
identiﬁed  two complementary  approaches,  both still in their infancy,  
for using nonbinary  gender stratiﬁcation  to tackle this complexity  and 
possibly  bring greater precision  to brain-behavior  relationships.  Such approaches  are also important  for allowing  greater inclusion  of partici-  
pants with nonbinary  gender identities.  
Nonetheless,  there are serious limitations  among these preliminary  
studies that indicate  a more rigorous  approach  will be needed.  These in- 
clude the small size of studies in Table 1 and the heterogeneity  of gender 
assessment  tools and brain measures  that precluded  meta-analysis  or as- 
sessment  of publication  bias. As recent analyses  make clear, sample sizes 
need to be much larger to ﬁnd reproducible  brain-behavior  associations  
( Marek et al., 2022 ) and will have to incorporate  doubly multivariate  
measures  ( Genon et al., 2022 ) as opposed  to the univariate  approaches  
in Table 1 . Another  problem  is the age and generalizability  of existing  
gender assessment  tools (Suppl.  Table 1), which are overly simplistic  
in reducing  gender attributes  to one or two linear dimensions  of mas- 
culinity  and femininity  and must be updated  to address  modern  gender 
expression  and intersectionality.  
To overcome  these limitations  and to enhance  the rigor and repro- 
ducibility  of this approach  going forward,  we recommend  that neu- 
roimaging  researchers  operationalize  gender using a new multidimen-  
sional consensus  tool, Stanford  Gender-related  Variables  for Health Re- 
search (GVHR),  developed  and validated  by Nielsen  et al. (2021) af- 
ter a systematic  synthesis  of existing  instruments.  The GVHR avoids 
treating  gender as a simple bipolar  spectrum  and is instead  based on 
seven discrete  variables  (caregiver  strain, work strain, independence,

risk-taking,  emotional  intelligence,  social support,  and discrimination),  
only some of which may be pertinent  to a speciﬁc  outcome  measure  
(e.g., brain anatomy  or mental health).  Importantly,  the questionnaire  
is built around self-reported  behaviors  and experiences  as opposed  to self- 
perceived  attributes  and was designed  to minimize  acquiescence  bias 
and avoid cuing stereotypes.  Of course, this tool will have to be updated  
periodically,  and diﬀerent  populations  will likely require  tailored  gen- 
der instruments  depending  on the research  question  ( Horstmann  et al., 
2022 ). 
At the same time, research  based on gender identity  itself may also 
contribute  to this approach.  Gender  self-identity  (as man, woman,  non- 
binary, genderqueer,  gender ﬂuid, two-spirit,  etc.) is distinct  from gen- 
der roles and traits but also contributes  to individuals’  behavior  and 
lived experiences.  Hence, neuroimaging  utilizing  non-binary  measures  
of gender identity  ( Tadiri et al., 2021 ) may also prove fruitful,  pro- 
vided it avoids stigmatizing  trans and gender diverse  people ( DuBois 
and Shattuck-Heidorn,  2021 ). 
Complementing  the use of gender as an independent  variable  in 
neuroimaging  is the opportunity  to use “big data ”a n d artiﬁcial  intel- 
ligence approaches  for ﬁnding  neural correlates  of non-binary  gender-  
related behaviors  without  group divisions  of any kind. As we review,  
at least three groups have attempted  this, using a range of diﬀerent  
brain (and other corporeal)  measures  to uncover  gradients  of neural 
attributes  that map onto one speciﬁc  dimension  of gender-related  psy- 
chology,  the internalizing-externalizing  spectrum.  Similar  approaches  
could be extended  to other dimensions  of gendered  behavior,  such as 
the empathy-aggression  spectrum  ( Eliot, 2021 ) or people-vs.-things  vo- 
cational  choices  ( Tao et al., 2022 ). Combining  hypothesis-driven  and 
data-driven/artiﬁcial  intelligence  approaches  in an iterative  fashion  of- 
fers great promise  for reﬁning  our models and thereby,  our understand-  
ing of brain-behavior  relationships  (e.g., Koppe et al., 2021 ). Although  
many studies have now used machine  learning  methods  to discriminate  
brains by binary sex ( Sanchis-Segura  et al., 2022 ), such methods  are only 
beginning  to be applied  to uncovering  neural correlates  of gendered  be- 
havior and experience.  
Sex and gender are both integral  to neurobehavioral  health. Human  
brain imaging  studies cannot ignore either variable  but should seek to in- 
tegrate both toward achieving  a deeper understanding  of brain organiza-  
tion and pathology.  Indeed,  as neuroscientists  strive to incorporate  other 
sociocultural  determinants  such as education  and poverty  ( Farah, 2017 ) 
into analyses  of brain anatomy  and function,  gender can serve as a test 
case for analyzing  the modulation  of biology  by factors such as status 
hierarchy,  economic  independence,  discrimination,  and social support.  
Such broadening  is also overdue  at the research  policy level, where 
health agencies  are keenly focused  on addressing  gender health dispar- 
ities. The U.S. Oﬃce of Research  on Women’s  Health has recognized  
the contribution  of both sex- and gender-related  factors to male/female  
health disparities  ( U.S. Department  of Health and Human  Services,  n.d. ), 
but the U.S. National  Institutes  of Health has thus far implemented  
only a Sex as a Biological  Variable  (SABV)  policy for addressing  them. 
This stands in contrast  to national  health agencies  in Canada  and Eu- 
rope, whose policies  equally  embrace  sex- and gender-based  approaches  
( White et al., 2021 ). We therefore  urge neuroimaging  researchers  to 
lead the way and “break the binary ”b y integrating  modern,  multi- 
faceted  measures  of gender into traditional  sex-based  approaches  for 
understanding  brain variation  and gender-linked  psychopathologies.

2.1. Subjects  
Forty-two  healthy  subjects  were recruited  for this study. These indi- 
viduals  were contacted  and recruited  with online ﬂyer advertisements  at 
the University  Hospital  Zurich and Balgrist  University  Hospital,  Switzer-  
land. The inclusion  criteria  were: i) ages between  18 and 80 years old, 
ii) no history of neurological  or psychological  conditions,  iii) no pre- 
vious history of chronic  pain or pain during participation  and iv) not 
taking any psychoactive  medication.  All subjects  provided  written  in- 
formed  consent  prior to all assessments  and were reimbursed  for their 
participation.  All procedures  described  below were in accordance  with 
the Declaration  of Helsinki.  The study has been approved  by the lo- 
cal ethics board ‘Kantonale  Ethikkommission  Zürich,  KEK’ (EK-04/2006,  
PB_2016–02,051,  clinicaltrial.gov  number:  NCT02138344).  
2.2. Study design 
Prior to neuroimaging  and CPM, subjects  completed  two question-  
naires: the Pain Catastrophizing  Scale (PCS) ( Sullivan  et al., 1995 ) and 
Beck Depression  Inventory  version  II (BDI-II)  ( Dozois et al., 1998 ). In 
order to test for sensory  integrity  in the tested area, thermal  thresholds  
were assessed  according  to the quantitative  sensory  testing protocol  of 
the German  Research  Network  on Neuropathic  Pain ( Rolke et al., 2006 ). 
Warm detection  and heat pain thresholds  (WDT and HPT, respectively)  
measurements  were performed  with the PATHWAY  Pain & Sensory  Eval- 
uation system (Medoc  Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel) using a 3 cm x 3 cm 
square thermode  attached  at the volar forearm.  Subjects  were blinded  
from the operator  screen during the measurement.  Thermal  thresh- 
olds were determined  by averaging  three trials of individual  stimuli.  Safety temperatures  for WDT and HPT were set at 55 °C. After obtain- 
ing thermal  thresholds,  subjects  who understood  the instructions  clearly 
were familiarised  with one TS and were acquainted  with the instruc-  
tions of MRI acquisition  and CPM procedure  including  the pain rating 
process.

1.1. Problems  can be solved with insight or analysis  
Creative  problem  solving  involves  a wide range of cognitive  pro- 
cesses and neural substrates,  and can vary in outcomes.  People can solve 
problems  in (at least) two general  ways: with insight or with analysis.  
Insight is often characterized  by a sudden  reorganization  of a mental 
representation  of the problem  ( Sternberg  et al., 1995 ) while an analysis  
approaches  the solution  deliberately  and incrementally,  in a step-by-step  
manner  ( Webb et al., 2016 ). Although  these can somewhat  overlap  or 
both contribute  to solving  (especially  for diﬀerent  steps in solving  com- 
plex problems),  insight and analysis  reﬂect diﬀerent  search and evalua-  
tion strategies.  
Previous  work studying  physiological  correlates  of insight have 
mostly used predeﬁned  signal construction:  functional  magnetic  reso- 
nance imaging  (fMRI) signal, EEG activity,  or eye-tracking  measures  at 
a selected  time range, time-locked  to stimulus  onset or to participant  re- 
sponse,  to study important  processes  engaged  at speciﬁc  moments  of cre- 
ative problem  solving  ( Jung-Beeman  et al., 2004 ; Kounios  et al., 2006 ; 
Salvi et al., 2015 , 2020 ). 
While those studies have advanced  our knowledge  of brain mech- 
anisms of insight,  there are limitations.  If the spatiotemporal  scope of 
predeﬁned  signals is too narrow,  the methodology  risks missing  signiﬁ- 
cant markers.  Conversely,  deﬁning  the scope too liberally  risks diluting  
the statistical  power of the analysis.  
A wholistic  data-driven  approach  to EEG analysis  can potentially  un- 
cover relevant  signals from a wide range of spatial and frequency  dis- 
tribution.  Because  there are no behavioral  markers  for problem  solv- 
ing stages other than an onset and a response,  unsupervised  machine  
learning  techniques  can be particularly  suitable  for this purpose.  Un- 
supervised  learning  uncovers  patterns  in the data without  prespeciﬁed  
labels. In this paper, we use an HMM, which is among the simplest  and 
most-used  methods  in pattern  recognition.  
1.2. Hidden Markov  models (HMM)  
Hidden  Markov  models assume  that a dynamic  system is driven by 
a sequence  of discrete  states (see Rabiner  and Juang, 1986 , for the gen- 
eral theory)  called a Markov  chain. The states are mutually  exclusive,  
recurring,  and the probability  of each state depends  only on the prior 
state (i.e., state sequence  is Markovian  ). Each state is associated  with 
an emission  probability  , a distinct  distribution  of the observed  data. Cru- 
cially, the state sequence  is hidden and can only be inferred  from the 
observables  ( Fig. 1 ). A hidden Markov  model is fully speciﬁed  by an 
initial probability  of a hidden state at the beginning,  a transition  prob- 
ability matrix between  states, and a set of emission  probabilities.  An 
expectation-maximization  algorithm  is commonly  used to estimate  the 
unknown  parameters  in a hidden Markov  model. The sequence  of hid- 
den states can then be estimated  by maximizing  posterior  probability  based on the observables  via a dynamic  programming  algorithm  (see 
Methods).  
In neuroscience  applications,  HMM provides  a data-driven  method  
to detect structures  in high-dimensional  data. It has been used to ex- 
plore dynamic  functional  connectivity  from magnetoencephalography  
(MEG) data under task and resting states ( Baker et al., 2014 ; Quinn et al., 
2018 ; Seedat et al., 2020 ; Vidaurre  et al., 2018 ). In sleep studies,  this 
data-driven  method  not only matches  human experts  in classifying  sleep 
stages ( Doroshenkov  et al., 2007 ), but also uncovered  “a rich repertoire  
of brain dynamics  underpinning  the traditional  PSG (polysomnography)  
stages ”( Stevner  et al., 2019 ) 
HMMs have also been successfully  applied  to many Brain- 
Computer  Interface  (BCI) applications  for diﬀerentiating  task con- 
ditions ( Williams  et al., 2018 ) or motor planning  ( Lederman  and 
Tabrikian,  2012 ; Neuper  et al., 2001 ). Finally,  a potentially  proliﬁc  
paradigm  has emerged  to study population  diﬀerences  (e.g., with 
psychological  diagnoses)  using metrics  derived  from hidden states 
( Shappell  et al., 2021 ). 
Although  there have been successes  in using Hidden  Markov  type 
models in a range of applications,  to our knowledge  this approach  has 
not been applied  to decode a cognitive  process  like problem-solving  in 
which component  processes  unfold spontaneously  over time (with lim- 
ited exception  in animal work, Kemere  et al., 2008 ). 
HMM is both similar and dissimilar  to other classiﬁcation  ap- 
proaches.  In HMM, the dynamics  of the system are described  by tran- 
sitions between  states in the state-time  course. In contrast,  methods  
such as ICA ( Brookes  et al., 2011 ) and micro-state  analyses  ( Koenig 
et al., 2005 ; Lehmann  and Skrandies,  1984 ) seek to decompose  time- 
series into sets of clusters  without  incorporating  the temporal  structure  
during model ﬁtting. A comparison  of these methods  in the context  of 
classifying  EEG microstates  can be found elsewhere  ( Rukat et al., 2016 ).

Zhang 2017 ; Burt et al., 2018 ; Fukutomi  et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2019 ; 
Toschi et al., 2019 ; Gao et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 2020a ; Paquola  et al., 
2020 ); however,  additional  considerations  arise when using T1w/T2w  
myelin maps to address  such questions.  For example,  although  in the ab- 
sence of head motion there is an exact correction  of the spatially  varying  
radiofrequency  (RF) receive  ﬁeld (B1-) eﬀects after taking the ratio of 
T1w and T2w images (either from the head coil or from the body coil 
after vendor receive  ﬁeld correction),  this ratio leaves in RF transmit  
(B1 + ) ﬁeld eﬀects because  they diﬀer between  the T1w and T2w images 
( Glasser  and Van Essen 2011 , and as will be discussed  in Section  2.1 be- 
low). These B1 + eﬀects are particularly  noticeable  in the HCP Young 
Adult (HCP-YA)  dataset because  of design compromises  speciﬁc  to that 
scanner  1 . These B1 + eﬀects in the T1w/T2w  myelin maps are most eas- 
ily appreciated  as correlated  cross-hemisphere  asymmetries  in the cor- 
tical T1w/T2w  ratio and B1 + maps (as will be noted in the results,  e.g., 
Figure 5 ). Because  such correlated  asymmetries  are not expected  neu- 
robiologically,  are not present  in alternative  myelin mapping  methods  
after B1 + correction  (e.g., Carey et al., 2018 ), and were much smaller  
in the original  Siemens  3T Trio datasets  (Conte69  from Glasser  and Van 
Essen 2011 ), an ad hoc correction  method  was initially  developed  to 
minimize  them for HCP-YA  data. This approach  entailed  subtracting  
the heavily  surface-smoothed  diﬀerence  between  a left/right  symmet-  
ric group average  Siemens  3T Trio T1w/T2w  myelin map and each in- 
dividual’s  T1w/T2w  myelin map, resulting  in the “bias-corrected  (BC) ”
MyelinMap  (MyelinMap_BC)  results produced  by the HCP Pipelines  and 
released  by the HCP ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ; see Figure 18 therein).  
Although  this “MyelinMap_BC  ” approach  works well for localizing  
cortical  areas in individual  participants,  as the sharp transitions  in cor- 
tical myelin content  at areal boundaries  are not aﬀected  by low spatial 
frequency  B1 + transmit  ﬁeld biases ( Glasser  et al., 2016a ), it was never 
intended  for cross-participant  statistical  analyses  of the sort mentioned  
above, as it removes  both artifactual  and genuine  cross-participant  
T1w/T2w  myelin map diﬀerences.  Further,  although  the Siemens  3T 
Trio-based  maps have reduced  B1 + eﬀects relative  to the customized  
HCP-YA  scanner,  these remaining  transmit  eﬀects are not zero, and are 
expected  to be present  on other scanner  platforms  as well. As a result, all 
prior T1w/T2w  myelin maps contain  at least some biases, as biases along 
the anterior-posterior  and superior-inferior  axes cannot be removed  by 
symmetrization  (such as a symmetric  center versus periphery  bias). Fi- 
nally, the actual B1 + transmit  ﬁeld is modulated  by the loading  of the 
body coil by both the participant’s  head and body, meaning  that ge- 
ometric  variables  such as head size and body size, and compositional  
variables  such as weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), will have spuri- 
ous correlations  with uncorrected  T1w/T2w  myelin maps across partic- 
ipants. Such B1 + eﬀects may correlate  with other variables  of interest,  
such as age or sex ( MacLennan  et al., 2021 ). To achieve  the same ﬂip 
angle in a particular  location  in the brain 2 , the scanner  transmit  ref- 
erence voltage  setting is calibrated  higher for larger heads and bodies, 
compensating  for the higher coil loading  (as will be shown in Table 1 ). 
Further,  the upper bodies of the participants  induce asymmetries  in the 
B1 + transmit  ﬁeld due to the circularly  polarized  transmit  coil, and these 
asymmetries  increase  when the subjects  bodies are larger ( Glover et al., 
1985 ; Sled and Pike 1998 ; Ibrahim  et al., 2001 ; as will be shown in the 
results when comparing  Figures  9 for children  with smaller  bodies on 
average  and 12 for adults with larger ones obtained  using the same se- 
1 The B1 + eﬀects are stronger  in HCP-YA  data because of the smaller 
56cm body transmit  coil needed to accommodate  the stronger  HCP-SC72  gra- 
dients (100 mT/m) of the customized  Siemens  3T ‘ConnectomS’  platform  
( U ğurbil et al., 2013 ). Additionally,  these design compromises  resulted  in the 
participants’  heads lying 5cm above the magnetic  ﬁeld isocenter  and also oﬀ- 
center, relative to the body transmit  coil, resulting  in reduced  B1 + uniformity  
through  the head.

polarized  body transmit  coils are used. 
Because  the HCP consortium  was aware of these limitations,  an Ac- 
tual Flip angle Imaging  (AFI) scan ( Yarnykh  2007 ), which measures  
the eﬀect of the non-uniform  B1 + transmit  ﬁeld on the ﬂip angle ob- 
tained in every voxel, was acquired  in most of the HCP-YA  partici-  
pants during the same imaging  session as the T1w and T2w structural  
images.  However,  use of these AFI scans to improve  the T1w/T2w  
myelin maps has remained  unexplored  until now. Additionally,  sub- 
sequent  HCP projects  including  the Human  Connectome  Development  
project (HCD) and Human  Connectome  Aging project (HCA) required  
shorter protocols  than the HCP-YA  project,  necessitating  removal  of 
the AFI scans and creation  of an alternative  approach  to B1 + transmit  
ﬁeld mapping  based on the images that were acquired.  Finally,  we ap- 
ply the B1 + correction  of T1w/T2w  myelin maps to a non-human  pri- 
mate study, the Non-Human  Primate  Neuroimaging  and Neuroanatomy  
Project (NHP_NNP),  as T1w/T2w  myelin maps are useful in cross-species  
comparisons  ( Glasser  et al., 2014 ; Mars et al., 2018 ; Autio et al., 2020 ; 
Hayashi  et al., 2021 ). 
Here, we demonstrate  a novel set of B1 + transmit  ﬁeld correction  
methods  of T1w/T2w  myelin maps using actual and “pseudo  ”m e a - 
sures of the B1 + transmit  ﬁeld (i.e., enabling  correction  even when a 
B1 + map was not obtained).  We ﬁt corrections  of the T1w/T2w  myelin 
maps at the group level, relying on (1) the hemispheric  asymmetry  of 
B1 + transmit  ﬁeld eﬀects, and (2) the neuroanatomically  grounded  as- 
sumption  that asymmetries  in cortical  myelin content  should not be 
correlated  with asymmetries  in the B1 + transmit  ﬁeld at the group 
level to bootstrap  corrected  reference  templates  for a given species.  We 
show that this correction  removes  not only the hemispheric  asymme-  
tries, but also additional  symmetric  biases. We then use these refer- 
ence templates  to correct individuals  T1w/T2w  myelin maps for B1 + 
transmit  ﬁeld eﬀects without  explicitly  relying on hemispheric  asym- 
metries.  We show that this correction  reduces  B1 + correlated  hemi- 
spheric  asymmetries,  symmetric  biases, and spurious  results in statistical  
comparisons  of basic biological  parameters  of interest  such as age, sex, 
or BMI across three independent  human datasets.  Finally,  we compare  
the transmit  and pseudo-transmit  correction  methods  in the more chal- 
lenging  macaque  dataset where the eﬀect is much smaller  and closer 
to the noise ﬂoor due to a smaller  brain size. The methods  and re- 
sults are organized  as follows:  Methods  section 2.1 discusses  the the- 
ory underlying  the T1w/T2w  approach  and our new correction  meth- 
ods; Methods  sections  2.2 - 2.6 present  the four datasets,  HCP-YA,  HCD, 
HCA, and NHP_NNP,  used in this study and the general  preprocess-

plementation  of the real and pseudo-transmit  correction  methods,  in- 
cluding  speciﬁc  issues pertaining  to each dataset’s  correction;  Meth- 
ods section 2.9 discusses  speciﬁc  issues related to transmit  and pseudo-  
transmit  ﬁeld correction  of macaques;  Methods  sections  2.10 - 2.13 ad-

improved  maps for neuroanatomical  use cases, and applying  the cor-

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119536,"2. What does fMRI measure?  
Early fMRI studies exposed  rodents  to global physiological  stimula-  
tion and showed  that blood oxygenation  can be used as an endogenous  
contrast  agent for MRI ( Ogawa et al., 1990a , 1990b ). This suggested  that 
fMRI might be used to indirectly  measure  neural activity.  However,  un- 
til experiments  were conducted  in humans  with sensory  stimulation,  it 
was unknown  exactly how neural activity  would aﬀect the BOLD signal. 
In fact, Ogawa and Colleagues  (1990a)  speculated  that the BOLD signal 
might decrease  during heightened  neural activity:  "" When some region in 
a brain is much more active than other regions,  the active region could show 
darker lines in the image because  of the increased  level of deoxyhemoglobin  
resulting  from higher oxygen consumption  "". 
Within a couple of years, human fMRI measurements  were made 
with visual ( Kwong et al., 1992 ; Ogawa et al., 1992 ) and motor 
( Bandettini  et al., 1992 ) stimulation  and the opposite  was found: Stim- 
ulation caused the fMRI signal to increase,  consistent  with foundational  
work from the 1980s showing  that neural activity  can lead to an increase

in the supply of oxygenated  blood outstripping  the consumption  of oxy- 
gen ( Fox and Raichle,  1986 ). Ogawa et al. (1992) found that visual stim- 
ulation increased  the water proton signal in primary  visual cortex (V1). 
Importantly,  they found that the proton signal in the tissue nearby (out- 
side of) small vessels increased,  and that this signal could be followed  
in time with the fMRI measurement.  Shortening  the echo time reduced  
the fMRI signal contrast,  indicating  that signal changes  are caused by a 
change in T 2 ∗ relaxation.  This was the ﬁrst human study to show that a 
stimulus  drives an intrinsic  contrast  agent (changes  in the concentration  
of deoxyhemoglobin  in cerebral  blood) and that this is what BOLD mea- 
sures. This study used visual stimulation  because  the researchers  knew 
precisely  where in the cortex to look for responses  and because  they 
knew that a visual stimulus  would produce  strong neural activity  that 
could be easily controlled.  It would have made little sense to attempt  to 
make new discoveries  about the neural basis of perception  while simul- 
taneously  trying to learn how fMRI works. 
As implied  from the initial fMRI work, the BOLD signal depends  on 
a complex  interplay  of changes  in oxygen  consumption,  blood ﬂow, and 
blood volume.  Vision science  has been used to understand  the interplay  
of these processes  and how they are reﬂected  in the fMRI response.  In 
particular,  much foundational  work on the biological  contributions  to 
the BOLD signal have depended  on experiments  with visual stimulation,  
including  fundamental  work on glucose  ( Fox et al., 1988 ) and oxidative  
metabolism  ( Hoge et al., 1999 ; Thompson  et al., 2004 , 2003 ) in the hu- 
man brain; on calibrated  fMRI ( Blockley  et al., 2013 ; Davis et al., 1998 ); 
on the contribution  of cerebral  metabolic  rate of oxygen  consumption,  
blood ﬂow and volume  to the BOLD response  ( Buxton et al., 2004 ; 
Kwong et al., 1992 ; Lu et al., 2003 ; Ogawa et al., 1993 ) and on the spa- 
tial localization  of these components  ( Duong et al., 2001 ; Malonek  and 
Grinvald,  1996 ; Vanzetta  and Grinvald,  1999 ; Zhao et al., 2006 ). These 
studies used visual stimulation  because  it provided  a speciﬁc  cortical  
target (calcarine  sulcus),  it enabled  precise temporal  control of neural 
activity,  and it induced  large, sustained  neural activity  as long as the 
stimulus  is present  (for review see Hillman  2014 ). 
These key studies linked blood oxygenation  to the fMRI response;  
however,  they did not address  what kinds of neural activity  might cause 
changes  in blood oxygenation.  It is likely that many facets of neural ac- 
tivity inﬂuence  the BOLD signal and there is not a single, simple an- 
swer to this question  (and we do not attempt  to answer it here). For re- 
views targeting  this question,  see Drew (2019) , Logothetis  (2003) , and 
Logothetis  and Wandell  (2004) . However,  vision science  found a useful 
way to reframe  and address  this question  by using known properties  of 
the visual system in speciﬁc  brain areas and well-oiled  stimulus  regimes.  
Visual neurophysiology  experiments  in animal models have de- 
scribed  neural responses  to systematic  variations  in fundamental  visual 
properties,  such as image contrast  and motion coherence,  well before the 
advent of fMRI. Researchers  were able to take advantage  of these neural 
responses  to better understand  the underlying  neural signal that fMRI 
measures.  Here, we focus on examples  of research  linking the fMRI sig- 
nal to stimulus  manipulations  for which the neural response  was known 
prior to the fMRI experiments.  Work from Rees et al. (2000) used vi- 
sual area hMT + to explore  the neural basis of the fMRI signal. The 
signal in hMT + increased  linearly  with stimulus  motion coherence  (cf. 
Birman  and Gardner  2018 ), as did prior measurements  of average  single 
neuron ﬁring rates in monkey  MT, linking the two signals together.  Sup- 
port came from a follow-up  from Heeger et al. (2000) who compared  the 
fMRI signal in human V1 with electrophysiological  recordings  of neural 
ﬁring from monkey  V1. Both measurements  were driven by stimuli that 
systematically  varied in contrast.  Moreover,  there was a proportional  
relationship  between  fMRI signal and the ﬁring rate of V1 neurons.  This 
link between  the contrast  response  measured  with electrophysiological  
and fMRI signals has been strengthened  by experiments  showing  that 
characteristics  such as adaptation  ( Gardner  et al., 2005 ) and satura- 
tion ( Vinke et al., 2022 ) can be reliably  measured  with fMRI. Moreover,  
simultaneous  measurements  of contrast  response  have shown a linear 
( Cardoso  et al., 2012 ) or threshold-linear  ( Logothetis  et al., 2001 ) re- lationship  between  the fMRI and electrophysiological  signal, thereby  
forming  a foundation  for the linkage  of these measured  fMRI signals to 
behavioral  measurements  ( Boynton  et al., 1999 ). 
Winawer  et al. (2013) investigated  the relation  between  the fMRI 
BOLD signal and electrocorticographic  (ECoG)  responses  in visual cor- 
tex in the spatial domain.  BOLD and broadband  ECoG responses  had the 
same sub-additive  spatial summation,  whereas  stimulus  locked ECoG re- 
sponses  did not. They concluded  that asynchronous  broadband  signals 
(closely  correlated  with spiking)  are an important  contributing  factor 
to the BOLD signal. Other work has used carefully  controlled  stimuli 
and a neural model to conﬁrm  that the broadband  response  in ECoG 
is well matched  to the BOLD signal, but that additional  variance  in 
the BOLD signal is related to the power of low frequency  oscillations  
( Hermes  et al., 2019 ). This supports  the claim that the BOLD signal is 
inﬂuenced  by neural signals other than spiking  ( Logothetis  and Wan- 
dell, 2004 ). 
It was not necessary  to complete  simultaneous  measurements  in 
these studies because  a quantitative  link was enabled  by matching  stim- 
ulus parameters  and recording  locations.  These studies shed light on the 
neural basis of the fMRI signal not by directly  comparing  the fMRI re- 
sponse to neural activity  (as the two are measured  in diﬀerent  units, 
time scales, and spatial extents)  but by comparing  each of them with 
reference  to parametric  variations  in the visual stimulus  ( Fig. 1 ). Three 
advantages  of this model-based,  or ’stimulus-referred’  method  over a 
correlation  method  are that: (1) it is robust to variation  in signal-to-  
noise across measurement  modalities;  (2) it ensures  a large dynamic  
range in the responses;  and (3) it captures  responses  to stimulus  prop- 
erties that are presumed  to be important  for information  encoding.  Fi- 
nally, these stimulus-referred  approaches  have recently  been expanded  
to ’image computable’  approaches  ( Kay et al., 2008 ) that can provide  
deeper understanding  of how responses  at the neural level translate  to 
population  responses  measured  by fMRI ( Gardner  and Merriam,  2021 ).",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(3992, 3996), match='\n2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8810, 8814), match=' \n3.'>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118824,"2. Massively  univariate  tests in general  linear model 
In the simplest  cases, we want to test the diﬀerence  between  exper- 
imental  conditions  on 𝑚 dependent  variables.  These 𝑚 dependent  vari- 
ables are distributed  in time and/or in space. The present  article focusses  
only on one-dimensional  signals (e.g., one EEG channel),  so the 𝑚 de- 
pendent  variables  are the responses  for the 𝑚 time points. We write the 
models as follows:  
𝑌 𝑠 = 𝑋𝛽𝑠 + 𝜖𝑠 ∀𝑠 ∈{ 1 , …, 𝑚 } (1) 
where 𝑌 𝑠 is the response  variable  vector for time point 𝑠 , 𝑋is the design 
matrix shared by the 𝑚 time points, 𝛽𝑠 is the parameter  vector of inter- 
ests of length 𝑞and, ﬁnally, 𝜖𝑠 the error terms. We assume  that each 𝜖𝑠 
follows  an unknown,  exchangeable  distribution.  Importantly,  𝜖𝑠 may be 
correlated  across the 𝑚 tests. Equation  (1) encompasses  models for anal- 
yses like regression,  𝑡 -test or one-way  ANOVA.  In all these models,  the 
tests of interest  can usually  be viewed  as testing simultaneously  𝑞 − 1 
contrasts:  
𝐻 0∶ 𝑠 ∶ 𝐺𝛽𝑠 = 0 , (2) 
where 𝐺is a 𝑞 − 1 ×𝑞contrast  matrix.  The 𝐹 or 𝑡 statistic  are typi- 
cal choices  as the univariate  test statistic  for each 𝑚 time point, but 
the procedures  can accept any statistic.  Let 𝐹 𝑠 be the statistic  at time

on the (unknown)  joint distribution  of the statistics  [ 𝐹 1 …𝐹 𝑚 ] ⊤.

Fig. 1. Schematic  of mouse hippocampus.  
a. Shows the hippocampus  in the mouse brain in red, extending  in a C-shape 
along a long (dorso-ventral;  d–v) axis, from the midline of the brain to the in- 
cipient temporal  lobe (a and p denote the anterior-to-posterior  axis). b. Shows 
a coronal slice of the mouse brain where the hippocampus  is labelled  red. c. 
Shows a cross section of the hippocampus  where the dentate gyrus (DG), and 
cornu ammonis  (CA) subﬁelds  are labelled.  Red arrows denote the proximal-to-  
distal axis, followed  clockwise  here, of the hippocampal  subﬁelds.  
and ventral-to-dorsal  in rodents  (see Fig. 1 for a schematic  overview  of 
the mouse hippocampus).  
A traditional  view has been that function  along the long axis of 
the hippocampus  is clearly segregated  into dorsal and ventral compart-  
ments, such that the ventral hippocampus  is associated  with emotion  
and fear, based on denser reciprocal  connectivity  with the amygdala  
and hypothalamus  ( Strange  et al., 2014 ), while the dorsal hippocam-  
pus is associated  with spatial navigation  and memory,  based partly on 
stronger  input from the sensory  cortices  ( Moser and Moser, 1998 ). A 
recent fMRI-based  parcellation  of the subcortex  divided  the hippocam-  
pus into anterior  and posterior  compartments  at ﬁner scales of par- 
cellation  ( Tian et al., 2020 ). Gene expression  (GE) studies in rodents  
similarly  characterise  the genomic  anatomy  of the hippocampus  as par- 
cellated,  such that the hippocampal  subﬁelds  are subdivided  along the 
long axis into distinct  molecular  domains  ( Bienkowski  et al., 2018 ; 
Dong et al., 2009 ; Fanselow  and Dong, 2010 ; Floriou-Servou  et al., 2018 ; 
Thompson  et al., 2008 ). Complicating  this picture,  the subﬁelds  appear 
to diﬀer in genomic  anatomy,  so that the diﬀerence  in GE along the 
long axis of CA1 is smaller  or more graded compared  to CA3, which is 
composed  into discrete  molecular  domains  ( Cembrowski  et al., 2016 ; 
Dong et al., 2009 ). 
Anatomical  tract tracing studies examining  structural  connectivity  
in rodents  provide  further support  for gradual  organisational  varia- 
tion along the long axis. These studies suggest  a topographical  gradient  
such that projections  from the hippocampus  to cortical  and subcortical  
structures,  such as the cingulate  cortex, nucleus  accumbens,  and amyg- 
dala, change gradually  along the hippocampal  long axis ( Kishi et al., 
2006 ; Strange  et al., 2014 ). Even more recent studies suggest  that the 
boundary-or-gradient  question  may be misconceived  and that a nu- 
anced picture of hippocampal  organisation  is needed.  For example,  a 
recent rodent study combining  GE and anatomical  tracing found that 
while discrete  molecular  domains  of the hippocampus  were connected  
to independent  brain-wide  networks,  there was also evidence  of dis- 
tributed  hippocampal  contributions,  with the latter likely supporting  the integration  of information  across distinct  hippocampal  networks  
( Bienkowski  et al., 2018 ). 
Here, we applied  gradient  analysis  to shed further light on the com- 
plex organisation  of the hippocampus.  Gradient  analysis  characterises  
the main axes of variance  in numerical  data in a location-dependent  
pattern;  in doing so, it can capture  both sharp and gradual  changes  
within a structure  and can tease out overlapping  principles  of organ- 
isation ( Prze ź dzik et al., 2019 ). Previous  studies have found that gra- 
dient analysis  captures  known variation  in microstructure,  structural  
connectivity,  GE maps, and task based fMRI results,  and can extend 
ﬁndings  from previous  studies ( Fulcher  et al., 2019 ; Haak et al., 2018 ; 
Huntenburg  et al., 2018 ; Margulies  et al., 2016 ; Marquand  et al., 2017 ; 
Paquola  et al., 2019 ). 
In humans,  gradient  analyses  of the hippocampus  have uncovered  
a principal  gradient  of organisation  such that FC changes  in a gradual  
manner  along the hippocampus  long axis ( Vos de Wael et al., 2018 ; 
Prze ź dzik et al., 2019 ). These studies reported  stronger  connectivity  of 
the anterior  hippocampus  to regions  associated  with higher-order  cog- 
nition and emotion  (e.g., default network)  and of posterior  regions  to 
visual and sensory  networks  regions.  Vos de Wael et al. (2018) addi- 
tionally  uncovered  a second medial-to-lateral  gradient,  which followed  
hippocampal  infolding,  and was correlated  with surface-based  markers  
of intracortical  microstructure,  indicating  interactions  between  tissue 
microstructure  and function.  
We set out to further advance  our understanding  of hippocampal  
functional  organisation  using the gradient  analysis  framework  proposed  
by Haak et al. (2018) to map the main axes of variation  in patterns  
of functional  connectivity  between  the hippocampus  and the rest of 
the brain, based on rsfMRI data collected  from lightly anaesthetized  
mice. Our analysis  applied  precisely  the same methods  to the mouse 
data as are used for human data, thus facilitating  direct comparison  
between  principles  of functional  organisation  across species.  Capitalis-  
ing on this translational  approach,  we applied  the same gradient  anal- 
ysis to hippocampal  gene coexpression  (GCE) data obtained  using the 
Anatomic  Gene Expression  Atlas (AGEA)  to compare  the main organ- 
isational  principles  of hippocampal  FC to patterns  of GCE ( Ng et al., 
2009 ). Previous  studies examining  diﬀerentially  expressed  genes within 
the hippocampus  have found strongly  represented  functional  categories  
that could be important  for the establishment  and maintenance  of 
FC ( Thompson  et al., 2008 ) Bienkowski  et al. (2018) . found distinct  
anatomical  connectivity  for distinct  hippocampal  GE domains  in ro- 
dents. Additionally,  a recent study by Vogel et al. (2020) found a strong 
relationship  (r 2 = 0.40) between  a human hippocampal  FC gradient  and 
the predicted  location  of hippocampal  tissue samples  based on GE pat- 
terns. We hypothesized  that these analyses  would uncover  a gradual  
long axis FC gradient  of mouse hippocampal  FC, analogous  to the gra- 
dients described  in humans  ( Vos de Wael et al., 2018 ; Prze ź dzik et al., 
2019 ). We expected  to ﬁnd corresponding  long axis variation  in GCE as 
well, demonstrating  a role for genomic  anatomy  in setting FC topogra-  
phy. 
2. Methods  and materials  
2.1. Animals,  rsfMRI preparation  
A pre-existing  dataset comprising  rsfMRI acquired  scans from 50 
lightly anesthetized  C57Bl6/J  and wild type mice was used in this study 
( Filipello  et al., 2018 ; Zerbi et al., 2015 ). All mice were adults (age: 
14 + /-4 weeks; bodyweight:  25.1 + /-3 g; 39/11 male/female).  The ex- 
periments  were performed  in accordance  with the Swiss federal guide- 
lines for the use of animals  in research,  and under licensing  from the 
Zürich Cantonal  veterinary  oﬃce. 
The mice were prepared  for rsfMRI using established  protocols  
( Chelini  et al., 2019 ; Grandjean  et al., 2014 ; Zerbi et al., 2015 ). Anaes- 
thesia was induced  with 4% isoﬂurane  and the animals  were endotra-  
cheally  intubated  and the tail vein cannulated.  The mice were positioned  
2  B. Gunnarsdóttir,  V. Zerbi and C. Kelly NeuroImage  253 (2022) 119082 
on an MRI-compatible  cradle, and artiﬁcially  ventilated  at 80 breaths  
per minute with a 1:4 O 2. to air ratio, and a 1.8 ml/h ﬂow (CWE, Ard- 
more, USA). A bolus injection  of pancuronium  bromide  (0.2 mg/kg),  a 
muscle relaxant,  was administered,  and isoﬂurane  was reduced  to 1%. 
Throughout  the experiment,  the mice received  a continuous  infusion  of 
pancuronium  bromide  (0.4 mg/kg/h).  Body temperature  was monitored  
using a rectal thermometer  probe, and maintained  at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. 
2.2. rsfMRI 
Data was acquired  using a Biospec  70/16 small animal MR system 
(Bruker  Biospin  MRI, Ettlingen,  Germany)  equipped  with a cryogenic  
quadrature  surface coil for signal detection  (Bruker  BioSpin  AG, Fällan- 
den, Switzerland).  Standard  adjustments  included  the calibration  of the 
reference  frequency  power and the shim gradients  using MapShim  (Par- 
avision  v6.1). A standard  gradient-echo  echo planar imaging  sequence  
(GE-EPI,  repetition  time TR = 1 s, echo time TE = 15 ms, in-plane  reso- 
lution RES = 0.22 ×0.2 mm 2 , number  of slice NS = 20, slice thickness  
ST = 0.4 mm, slice gap = 0.1 mm) was used to acquire  900 volumes  in 
15 min.

multiple  comparisons  across sources  are required  4) possibly  more re- 
sources  are needed  to be spent on the acquisition  of individual  anatomi-  
cal magnetic  resonance  imaging  data. However,  despite the relative  ease 
with which sensor space analysis  can be performed,  it may potentially  
obfuscate  any ﬁne degree of spatial speciﬁcity  of neuronal  rhythms  to 
behavior,  especially  for EEG studies.  Therefore,  it is of interest  to assess 
in more detail how analysis  in sensor space may blur contributions  of 
diﬀerent  types of rhythms.  
The methodological  validity  of measures  derived  from sensor space 
data is especially  relevant  for studies involving  EEG recordings  with 
a small number  of electrodes.  For instance,  in a clinical  setting,  time 
constraints  often limit the number  of electrodes  which can be placed 
on a patient.  For instance,  Light et al. (2015) used 1-electrode  EEG to 
study a large cohort of patients  with schizophrenia.  In neurofeedback  
studies,  typically  participants  receive  feedback  in the form of oscilla- 
tory power of a single/limited  number  of sensors.  In closed-loop  EEG 
studies ( Schaworonkow  et al., 2019; Zrenner  et al., 2018 ), where mag- 
netic stimulation  is given dependent  on features  of EEG rhythms,  only 
a small number  of EEG electrodes  is used for the extraction  of features  
of interest  to be robust against  experimental  noise. If only a small num- 
ber of sensors  is to be used, the sensitivity  of measures  for this speciﬁc  
recording  setup has to be considered  in order to reliably  detect the phe- 
nomena  of interest.  
In this article, we illustrate  the impact of spatial mixing on neu- 
ronal rhythms  on the sensor space level compared  to the source-level.  
A number  of studies has evaluated  consistency  and sensitivity  of mea- 
sures in sensor vs source space in the realm of connectivity  metrics  
with respect to volume  conduction  and linear mixing ( Lai et al., 2018; 
Mahjoory  et al., 2017 ). But here we focus on univariate  properties  of 
neuronal  rhythms,  mainly band-power  of rhythms  in the alpha-band.  
While many previous  studies acknowledge  the problem  of volume  con- 
duction  for the EEG/MEG  analysis  in sensor space in general,  to the 
best of our knowledge  there are no reports directly  showing  how in- 
dividual  components/sources  are actually  mixed at the level of sen- 
sors. We do so in this paper using speciﬁcally  alpha rhythms,  while the 
main conclusions  can be generalized  to other oscillations  and evoked  
responses.  
The main contribution  of the following  article is the quantiﬁcation  
of spatial mixing of rhythms  on the sensor space level. First, we dis- 
cuss an easy-to-use  method  for assessing  origin and spatial spread of 
extracted  rhythms  given a standard  sensor scheme  via the calculation  
of spatial patterns  and demonstrate  practical  applications.  We then use 
spatial patterns  to assess spatial mixing of neuronal  rhythms  on the sen- 
sor space level compared  to source level by using simulations  in a real- 
istic head model and a large dataset of EEG resting-state  rhythms.  Here, 
we illustrate  constituent  band-power  contributions  of diﬀerent  rhythms  
in the alpha-band  in single sensors.  Additionally,  we show how spatial 
mixing is even more problematic  when using ratio-measures  of oscil- 
lations,  due to the dynamic  nature of oscillations,  with high varying  
amplitude  modulation  of neuronal  rhythms,  aﬀecting  relative  contribu-  
tions of speciﬁc  rhythms.  We hope that our illustrations  provide  intu- 
itions for basic and clinical  researchers,  in order to evaluate  whether  
sensor space analysis  may or may not be appropriate  for their use 
case. 
2. Materials  and methods  
The analysis  was performed  using python and MNE version  0.23 
( Gramfort  et al., 2013 ) for the empirical  analysis.  The analysis  code 
needed  to reproduce  the analysis  and ﬁgures is available  here: https: 
//github.com/nschawor/meg-  eeg- leadﬁeld-  mixing . While we show ex- 
amples for single participants  in the following,  it is possible  to gen- 
erate these types of plots for all other participants  with the provided  
code. 2.1. Experimental  recordings  
For the empirical  data analysis,  we analyzed  EEG data which was 
previously  collected  in the project “Leipzig  Cohort for Mind-Body-  
Emotion  Interactions  ”(LEMON).  We summarize  participant  details and 
EEG data acquisition  brieﬂy in the following.  A more extensive  descrip-  
tion of the dataset of all study components  can be found in the original  
publication  ( Babayan  et al., 2019 ). Additionally,  we analyzed  the resting 
data portion  of an open MEG data set ( Schoﬀelen  et al., 2019 ). 
2.1.1. Participants  
EEG data was collected  from 216 volunteers  who did not have a 
history of neurological  disease  or usage of drugs that target the central 
nervous  system.  The study protocol  was approved  by the ethics commit-  
tee at the medical  faculty at the University  of Leipzig  (reference  num- 
ber 154/13-ﬀ)  and conformed  to the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Written  
informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants  prior to the ex- 
periment.  Data from 13 participants  were excluded  because  the ﬁles 
lacked event information,  had a diﬀerent  sampling  rate, mismatched  
header ﬁles or insuﬃcient  data quality.  In addition,  the data from 18 
participants  was excluded  because  of a low signal-to-noise  ratio in the 
alpha-band  as indicated  by a 1/f-corrected  spectral  peak in the alpha- 
band below 5 dB (see Spectral  analysis  section for exact procedure).  
One participant  was excluded  because  of suspected  wrong ordering  of 
channel  names, resulting  in corrupted  spatial patterns.  This resulted  
in datasets  from 181 participants  (117 male, 64 female,  age range: 
20–77 years). 
MEG data was collected  from 204 volunteers  with no history of neu- 
rological  disease.  The study protocol  was approved  by the ethics com- 
mittee (CMO - the local ‘Committee  on Research  Involving  Human  Sub- 
jects’ in the Arnhem-Nijmegen  region)  and conformed  to the declaration  
of Helsinki.  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants  
prior to the experiment.  For 6 participants,  resting state data was not 
available.  In addition,  the data from 57 participants  was excluded  be- 
cause of a low signal-to-noise  ratio in the alpha-band  as indicated  by a 
1/f-corrected  spectral  peak in the alpha-band  below 5 dB. This resulted  
in datasets  from 141 participants  (75 male, 66 female,  age range: 18–29 
years). 
2.1.2. Recording  setup 
Scalp EEG was recorded  from a 62-channel  active electrode  cap (Ac- 
tiCAP, Brain Products  GmbH, Germany).  In this conﬁguration,  61 elec- 
trodes were in the international  10–20 system arrangement,  and one 
additional  electrode  below the right eye was used to monitor  vertical  
eye movements.  The reference  electrode  was located  at FCz, and the 
ground  electrode  at the sternum.  The impedance  for all electrodes  was 
kept below 5 k Ω. Data was acquired  with a BrainAmp  MR plus am- 
pliﬁer (Brain Products  GmbH, Germany)  at an amplitude  resolution  of 
0.1 𝜇V with an online band-pass  ﬁlter between  0.015 Hz and 1 kHz 
and with a sample rate of 2500 Hz. Recordings  were made in a sound- 
attenuated  EEG booth. In the experimental  session,  a total of 16 blocks 
were recorded,  each lasting 60 s. Two conditions  were interleaved,  eyes 
closed and eyes open, starting  in the eyes closed condition.  During eyes 
open blocks, participants  were instructed  to ﬁxate on a digital ﬁxation  
cross. Changes  between  conditions  were announced  with the software  
Presentation  (v16.5,  Neurobehavioral  Systems  Inc., USA). 
MEG data was recorded  using a 275-channel  axial gradiometer  sys- 
tem (CTF). Additionally,  three bipolar  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  measured  
horizontal  and vertical  electro-oculogram  and the electrocardiogram.  
Three head localizer  coils were positioned  on the participant’s  head (na- 
sion, left and right ear canals),  head position  was continuously  moni- 
tored. Data was acquired  with a sampling  rate of 1200 Hz. For the rest- 
ing state measurements,  participants  were instructed  to think of nothing  
speciﬁc  while focusing  on the ﬁxation  cross at the center of the screen 
for 5 min.

Fig. 1. Analysis  pipeline  for quantifying  the contributions  of independent  rhythms  on sensor activity.  A. The two datasets  consisted  of 62-channel  resting- 
state EEG recordings  for eyes open and eyes closed conditions  and 275-channel  resting state MEG recordings  with eyes open. B. Spatial ﬁlters and patterns  were 
calculated  with spatio-spectral  decomposition  (SSD) using narrow-band  data in the individual  spectral peak in the alpha frequency-band.  C. The entries of the spatial 
patterns  for each sensor were extracted  and normalized,  the absolute  value was taken to calculate  the sensor complexity  for each sensor. 
2.2. Data analysis  
2.2.1. Preprocessing  
We used the available  preprocessed  data of the LEMON  dataset,  with 
the preprocessing  as applied  by the data creators.  The preprocessing  is 
described  brieﬂy in the following:  Raw data was downsampled  from 
2500 Hz to 250 Hz and band-pass  ﬁltered  in the frequency  range 1–
45 Hz with a Butterworth  ﬁlter, with ﬁlter order 4. Raw activity  traces 
were visually  inspected  and outlier electrodes  with frequency  shifts in 
voltage  and of poor signal quality were excluded.  Data was inspected  
for intervals  with extreme  peak-to-peak  deﬂections  and large bursts of 
high-frequency  activity  and these intervals  were discarded.  In order to 
reduce the dimensionality  of EEG signals,  principal  component  analysis  
was used to keep principal  components  that explain  95% of the total data 
variance.  Next, independent  component  analysis  based on the Extended  
Infomax  algorithm  was performed  (step size: 0.00065/log(number  of 
electrodes),  annealing  policy: weight change > 0.000001,  learning  rate 
is multiplied  by 0.98, stopping  criterion:  maximum  number  of iterations  
512 or weight change < 0.000001).  Any component  that reﬂected  eye 
movements,  eye blinks, muscle activity  or heartbeat  related activity  was 
removed,  as evaluated  by visual inspection.  The remaining  independent  
components  (mean number:  21.4, range: 14–28) were projected  back 
to sensor space. Importantly,  components  with alpha peaks were typ- 
ically not removed.  Therefore,  the remaining  components  represent  a 
vast amount  of alpha-related  activity.  
2.2.2. Spectral  analysis  
As the focus here is oscillatory  activity  in the alpha frequency-band,  
we included  only participants  which exceeded  a signal-to-noise  ratio 
in the alpha frequency-band.  For this, we used a criterion  of > 5 dB 
as in our previous  work ( Schaworonkow  and Nikulin,  2019 ). To deter- 
mine the signal-to-noise  ratio in the alpha band, the frequency  spectrum  was computed  with Welch’s  method  (Hann window,  2 s window  length, 
50% overlap).  To subtract  the 1/f-contribution  from the spectrum,  we 
used spectral  parametrization  ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ). The settings  used 
were: maximum  number  of peaks = 5; aperiodic  mode = ﬁxed, peak 
width limits = (0.5, 12), minimum  peak height = 0; peak threshold  = 2, 
frequency  range of ﬁt = 2–35 Hz. Participants  were included  if at least 
one electrode  on the midline  displayed  an oscillatory  peak > 5 dB in the 
alpha band, as evaluated  over the whole recording  length.

2019 ). In addition,  inter-individual  diﬀerences  have shown to not nec- 
essarily  be in line with results obtained  via the group comparison  ap- 
proach ( Wolfers  et al., 2019 ). Such heterogeneity  has been considered  
a potential  cause for the lack of diﬀerences  between  clinical  groups and 
controls  within the standard  group comparison  approach  ( Feczko et al., 
2019 ) and the failure to replicate  ﬁndings  between  studies ( Fried, 2017 ). 
As a consequence,  there has been a shift in focus towards  taking into ac- 
count variation  at the individual  level ( Marquand  et al., 2019 ). This is in 
line with a trend towards  personalized  medicine  or ”precision  medicine  ”
( Mirnezami  et al., 2012 ), where characteristics  of an individual  are used 
to guide the treatment  of mental disorders.  
This shift has been accompanied  by a trend towards  approaches  that 
go beyond  comparing  averages  of distinctly  labeled  groups ( Insel et al., 
2010; Insel, 2014 ). Among  them, normative  modeling  has been success-  
fully used to capture  inter-individual  variability  and make predictions  at 
the individual  level. The strength  of normative  modeling  lies within the 
ability to map variation  across one or more biological  response  variables  
(e.g., brain volume)  onto one or more covariates  or predictor  variables  
(e.g., age), redeﬁning  the variation  in the ﬁrst dimension  as explained  
by this new covariate(s)  of interest.  Normative  modeling  maps the nor- 
mative variation,  thus the range containing  e.g., 95% of all individuals,  
as a function  of the covariates.  As a consequence,  each individual’s  score 
is considered  in relation  to the variation  in the reference  group deﬁned  
by the covariates,  allowing  to calculate  a z-score of deviation  from the 
norm at the level of the individual.  The concept  is similar to the use 
of growth  charts in pediatric  medicine,  in which height and weight are 
expressed  as a function  of age. Hence, in such setting,  an individual’s  
height or weight is not considered  by its absolute  value, but expressed  
as a percentile  score of deviation  ﬂuctuating  with age, with the median  
line corresponding  to the 50% percentile  and deﬁning  the norm, or av- 
erage, height. 
In neuroimaging,  normative  models have been applied  to clinical  and 
non-clinical  problems  using various  covariates,  statistical  modeling  ap- 
proaches  (for an overview  see ( Marquand  et al., 2019; 2016 )) and target- 
ing a variety of response  variables.  In general,  any variable  can be used 
as a covariate  in a normative  model targeting  neuroimaging  measures,  
as long as the variation  along the co-varying  dimension  is not zero. How- 
ever, normative  models with age and sex as covariates  and brain volume  
as response  variable  are currently  more frequently  found in the literature  
( Kessler et al., 2016; Wolfers  et al., 2020; 2018b; Zabihi et al., 2019b ). 
These implement  the growth  charting  idea applied  to high dimensional  
brain imaging  data. To give an example  of a use case, a normative  model 
of a brain structure  with age can be created  based on the variation  of in- 
dividuals  in population  based cohorts.  The estimated  norm can be used 
to infer where individuals  with clinical  symptoms  can be placed with 
respect to the reference  deﬁned  by the normative  model. This has been 
the recipe of many recently  published  studies using the normative  mod- 
eling framework  ( Bethlehem  et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2020; Wolfers  et al., 
2019; 2020 ). As outlined  before, these individually  derived  patterns  of 
deviation  can uncover  associations  to clinical/behavioral  variables  that 
would be obscured  by averaging  across groups of individuals.  
The amount  of data, however,  necessary  to create normative  
models poses a challenge  to normative  modeling  in neuroimag-  
ing, as the cost and time factor associated  with neuroimaging  data 
impedes  the collection  of large neuroimaging  samples  in a har- 
monized  way. One exceptional  example,  where large scale data 
collection  succeeded  and included  both harmonized  scanners  and 
scanning  protocols,  is the UK Biobank  initiative.  When launched  
in 2006, it aimed to scan 100,000  individuals  at four diﬀer- 
ent scanning  locations  [ https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/explore-your-  
participation/contribute-further/imaging-study  ]( Miller et al., 2016 ). 
Other neuroimaging  initiatives  have also taken on the challenge  to col- 
lect neuroimaging  data in large scale quantities  and have relied on har- 
monized  scanning  protocols,  but did not collect the data using harmo-  
nized scanners  (i.e., ADNI ( Mueller  et al., 2005 ) and the ABCD study 
( Volkow  et al., 2018 )). Nonetheless,  the restricted  age ranges (e.g., 40–69 years in UK Biobank  ( Miller et al., 2016 )), or focus on a particu-  
lar (clinical)  cohort (e.g., Alzheimer’s  in ADNI, ( Mueller  et al., 2005 )) 
limit their applied  and clinical  utility for estimating  normative  mod- 
els mapping  the normative  association  between,  for example,  age and 
brain structure  or function  (although  normative  modeling  is possible  on 
restricted  data sets from a purely technical  perspective,  as demonstrated  
in the current  manuscript).  
An alternative  way to obtain large neuroimaging  data sets and as- 
sess data from a large number  of subjects  is by pooling  or sharing  data 
that has already  been collected.  One example  is the Enhancing  Neu- 
roImaging  and Genetics  through  Meta-Analysis  (ENIGMA)  consortium  
( Thompson  et al., 2020 ). ENIGMA  succeeded  in pooling  neuroimaging  
and genetics  data of thousands  of individuals,  including  healthy  indi- 
viduals  and individuals  with psychiatric  or neurological  disorders.  The 
strategy  of data sharing  initiatives  like ENIGMA  is to collect already  
collected  data from diﬀerent  cohorts  and diﬀerent  scanning  sites and 
harmonize  preprocessing  and statistical  analysis  with standardized  pro- 
tocols. However,  a major disadvantage  is the presence  of confounding  
”scanner  eﬀects ”( Fortin et al., 2018; 2017 ) (e.g., diﬀerences  in ﬁeld 
strength,  scanner  manufacturer  etc. ( Han et al., 2006 ))). These con- 
founding  eﬀects present  as site correlated  biases that cannot be ex- 
plained  by biological  heterogeneity  between  samples.  An example  of 
those eﬀects on derived  measures  of cortical  thickness  can be found in 
Fig. 1 a. They result from a potentially  complex  interaction  between  site 
and variables  of interest,  manifesting  in biases on lower and higher order 
properties  of the distribution  of interest,  such as diﬀerences  in mean and 
standard  deviations,  skewness  and spatial biases Fig. ( 1 a, 1 b), and can- 
not be explained  by e.g., diﬀerences  in age or sex Fig. ( 1 c). As the origin 
of these eﬀects might not only be related to the scanner  per se , but extend 
to various  factors related to a single acquisition  site ( Gronenschild  et al., 
2012 ), we will refer to them as site eﬀects from here on. 
As outlined  in the previous  paragraph,  the eﬀort to create large sam- 
ples to capture  between  subject variability  often induces  site-driven  vari- 
ability. This issue of site-driven  variability  in shared neuroimaging  data 
has been acknowledged  and has led to the development  of harmoniza-  
tion methods  at a statistical  level. A common  approach  to deal with 
site eﬀects is through  ”harmonizing  ”by, e.g., confound  regression.  One 
example  of this approach  is a set of algorithms  summarized  under the 
name ”ComBat  ”( Fortin et al., 2017 ). The method  had originally  been 
developed  by Johnson  et al. (2007) , who used empirical  Bayes to esti- 
mate ”batch eﬀects ”, referring  to non-biological  variation  in micro-array  
experiments  for gene expression  data. Fortin and colleagues  adapted  
the framework  to apply to neuroimaging  data ( Fortin et al., 2017 ). In 
ComBat,  additive  and multiplicative  site eﬀects on a particular  target 
unit (e.g., a particular  brain voxel for one participant)  are estimated  
using empirical  Bayes and by placing  a prior distribution  over those 
estimates  for these units. The estimate  of the scanner  eﬀect is then 
used to adjust the prediction.  Newer versions  also allow to preserve  
variance  of interest  in the model, for example  for age, sex or diag- 
nosis ( Fortin et al., 2018; 2017 ) and to model non-linear  associations  
between  the predictor/covariate  and the target variable,  for example  
ComBat  Gam Pomponio  et al. (2020) . ComBat  has been applied  to sev- 
eral types of neuroimaging  data, including  diﬀusion  tensor imaging  data 
(DTI, ( Fortin et al., 2017 )) and structural  magnetic  resonance  imaging  
data, in particular  measures  of cortical  thickness  ( Fortin et al., 2018 ). 
The estimation  and interpretation  of site eﬀects is relatively  straight-  
forward  if site eﬀects are orthogonal  to the eﬀect of interest  and uncor- 
related with other covariates  in the model. In those cases, site is just an 
additive  eﬀect that can be easily estimated  and removed  without  aﬀect- 
ing other variables  ( Chen et al., 2014 ). However,  this is often not the 
case in neuroimaging  cohorts  containing  data pooled from several sites. 
For example,  many individual  neuroimaging  samples  are restricted  to a 
speciﬁc  age range, leading  to age being correlated  with site eﬀects. In 
those scenarios,  removing  an estimate  of the scanner  eﬀect can also re- 
move (biological)  variation  that would be of interest.  This is undesirable  
from the point of view of normative  modeling,  where analysis  focuses  on

deviations  from a reference  model because  the deviations  from a model 
where scanner  eﬀects have been regressed  out in a two stage procedure  
may be diﬀerent  from a model that integrates  site information  in a sin- 
gle regression.  Data harmonization  also has other features  that make it 
sub-optimal  from the view point of normative  modeling:  ﬁrst, many im- 
plementations  pool estimates  over voxels or parcels,  which means that 
the centiles  of population  variation  at a particular  brain region are in- 
ﬂuenced  by other regions.  This leads to the interdependence  of spatially  
and anatomically  independent  regions  and structures  (e.g., cortical  and 
sub-cortical  measures)  and to a loss biologically  meaningful  variation  
due to a forced shared homoscedastic  variance  term. Second,  a prob- 
lem that is not widely appreciated  in the neuroimaging  ﬁeld is that data 
harmonization  strategies  can yield overly optimistic  inferences  in down- 
stream analyses  due to an under-estimation  of the uncertainty  of model 
coeﬃcients  Nygaard  et al. (2016) .) In contrast,  normative  modeling  ap- 
proaches  can be thought  of as transforming  the data to a set of refer- 
ence centiles  across the population  (e.g. in terms of age and sex) which 
also account  for site eﬀects. In the hierarchical  Bayesian  framework  we 
present,  this can capitalize  on correlations  between  site and covariates  
of interest  to obtain more precise estimates  of higher-level  parameters  
that describe  the distribution  of data from diﬀerent  sites. This is in turn 
reﬂected  in more precise estimates  of the centiles  themselves.  
For these reasons,  we suggest  an alternative  approach  to harmoniza-  
tion to deal with site eﬀects in neuroimaging  data. While we focus in 
particular  on structural  neuroimaging,  our approach  can be also applied  
to other neuroimaging  data analysis  scenarios.  We propose  a hierarchi-  
cal Bayesian  approach  in which we include  site as a random  eﬀect in 
the normative  model. This step avoids the exclusion  of meaningful  vari- 
ance correlated  with site by predicting  site eﬀects as part of the model 
instead  of removing  them from the data. 
This approach  is similar to the approach  by Kia et al. (2020) , who 
used hierarchical  Bayesian  regression  (HBR) in a similar way for multi- 
site normative  modeling  in a pooled neuroimaging  data set, which con- 
tained 7499 participants  who were scanned  on 33 diﬀerent  scanners.  
Kia et al. (2020) ’s estimate  of site variation  is based on a partial pool- ing approach,  in which the variation  between  site-speciﬁc  parameters  
is bound by a shared prior. The approach  showed  better performance  
when evaluated  with respect to metrics  accounting  for the quality of 
the predictive  mean and variance  compared  to a complete  pooling  of 
site parameters  and to ComBat  harmonization,  and similar performance  
to a no-pooling  approach,  with the beneﬁt of reduced  risk of over-ﬁtting  
due to the shared site variance.  Moreover,  Kia et al. (2020) also showed  
that the posterior  distribution  of site parameters  from the training  set 
can also be used as an informed  prior to make predictions  in an un- 
seen, new, test set, outperforming  predictions  from complete  pooling  
and uninformed  priors. The method  was also able to preserve  and parse 
heterogeneity  between  individuals  with varying  clinical  diagnoses  in as- 
sociated  brain regions  of 1017 clinical  patients  of the study. 
The present  paper is a replication  and extension  of the approach  by 
Kia et al. (2020) . Based on several successful  attempts  of using Gaussian  
Process  Regression  to map non-linearity  in normative  models ( Kia and 
Marquand,  2018; Marquand  et al., 2014; 2016 ), we extend the norma-  
tive model with the capacity  to account  for site eﬀects and by adding a 
Gaussian  process  to model non-linear  eﬀects between  age and the brain 
structure.  In addition,  our model is fully Bayesian  and entails a hier- 
archical  structure,  including  priors and hyper-priors  for each parame-  
ter. In present  paper, we ﬁrst use the healthy  control sample from the 
ABIDE (autism  brain imaging  data exchange,  http://www.preprocessed-  
connectomes-project.org/abide/  ) ( Di Martino  et al., 2014 ) data set to 
compare  a non-linear,  Gaussian  process  version  of the normative  model, 
to a linear hierarchical  Bayesian  version  accounting  for site eﬀects that 
does not include  the Gaussian  Process  term. We then show that the hi- 
erarchical  Bayesian  models including  a site parameter  perform  better 
than existing  methods  for dealing  with additive  and multiplicative  (non- 
linear) site eﬀects, including  ComBat,  ComBat  Gam Fortin et al. (2018, 
2017) ; Pomponio  et al. (2020) and regressing  out site. Subsequently,  
we validate  the hierarchical  Bayesian  models in the autism sample of 
the ABIDE data set and test their ability to retain clinically  useful vari- 
ance while correcting  for site eﬀects. We ﬁnally discuss the normative  
hierarchical  Bayesian  methods  with regard to their implications  for neu-

roimaging  data-sharing  initiatives  and their use as general  technique  to 
correct for site eﬀects. 
2. Methods  
In this section,  we will introduce  the data used in this study and the 
pre-processing  steps applied,  followed  by a conceptual  and mathemati-  
cal description  of our approach  to include  site as covariate  in a norma-  
tive hierarchical  Bayesian  model. We will also illustrate  other methods  
and models (than including  site as covariate)  to accommodate  for site 
eﬀects. Those will be used to validate  our approach  against.  Lastly, we 
will outline which measures  will be used for comparing  our method  of 
including  site in a hierarchical  Bayesian  Model to those other methods.  
2.1. Data 
The following  sub-section  aims to give a description  of the ABIDE 
data set, including  a study on the scope of site eﬀects in the data. 
2.1.1. ABIDE Data set 
The ABIDE consortium  ( http://www.preprocessed-connectomes-  
project.org/abide/  ) was founded  to facilitate  research  and collabora-  
tion on autism spectrum  disorders  by data aggregation  and sharing.  The 
consortium  provides  a publicly  available  structural  magnetic  resonance  
imaging  (MRI) data set and corresponding  phenotype  information  of 
1051 individuals,  which comprise  539 individuals  with autism spectrum  
disorder  (ASD) and 573 age-matched  typical controls.  
For the present  study, we reduced  the number  of individuals  in the 
data set to 569 healthy  controls  (470 male) and 482 individuals  with 
autism (430 male). This reduction  in participant  numbers  was a con- 
sequence  of the exclusion  of all participants  with more than 10% or 
data points (or three ROIS) missing,  which aﬀected  4 healthy  controls  
and 57 individuals  with autism.  The data were processed  using a stan- 
dardized  protocol  ( Craddock  et al., 2013 ) of the FreeSurfer  standard  
pipeline  (Desikan-Kiliany  Atlas) as part of the Preprocessed  Connectomes  
Project ( Craddock  et al., 2013 ) and have been made available  for down- 
load on the preprocessed  section of the ABIDE initiative.  For the current  
study, we focused  on cortical  thickness  measures  of the 34 bilateral  re- 
gions (averaged  between  left and right hemisphere)  of the Desikian  Kil- 
liany atlas parcellation  ( Desikan  et al., 2006 ) as a part of the FreeSurfer  
( Fischl et al., 2004 ) output and the average  cortical  thickness  across 
measure  all 34 regions.  We chose to include  only cortical  thickness  mea- 
sures since they show a strong (negative)  association  with age (unlike 
measures  of surface area, which remain more stable across the lifespan  
( Storsve  et al., 2014 )). 
2.1.2. Site eﬀects in the ABIDE data set 
The ABIDE data set has been obtained  by aggregating  data from 
20 independent  samples  collected  at 17 diﬀerent  scanning  locations  
( Di Martino  et al., 2014 ). Although  all data have been collected  with 3 
Tesla scanners  and preprocessed  in a harmonized  way ( Craddock  et al., 
2013 ), sequence  parameters  for anatomical  and functional  data, as well 
as type of scanner  vary across sites ( Di Martino  et al., 2014 ). In addi- 
tion, sites diﬀer in distribution  of age and sex and in sample size. An 
overview  of site-speciﬁc  data is provided  in Table 1 and in ( Di Martino  
et al., 2014 ). 
The ABIDE data set is aﬀected  by site speciﬁc  eﬀects that are un- 
likely to be explained  by biological  variation.  They manifest  as linear 
and non-linear  interactions  between  scanning  site, covariates  (for ex- 
ample age and sex), and cortical  measures.  Similar  to batch eﬀects in 
genomics  ( Leek et al., 2010 ), those eﬀects lead to a clustering  of the 
data caused by external  factors related to the scanning  and analysis  pro- 
cess. With the aim to estimate  to which extent the ABIDE data set is 
aﬀected  by site eﬀects, we calculated  an ANCOVA  with age as covari- 
ate in the healthy  control sample of the data set. It revealed  that aver- 
age cortical  thickness  diﬀered  between  site (main eﬀect site: F(19, 516) = 4.4, p < 0 . 1 ×10 −8 , sum contrast.  partial 𝜂2 for site between  0.51- 
0.58 for raw data, see supplementary  material  Table 1.). In addition  we 
tested for diﬀerences  in variance  between  sites. Bartlett’s  sphericity  test 
Bartlett  (1937) showed  a diﬀerence  in variance  between  sites even af- 
ter regressing  out variance  that could be explained  by age and sex (p < 
0.001).  The site eﬀects in the healthy  control sample of the ABIDE data 
set are visualized  in Fig. 1 . 
2.2. Pre-processing  of the ABIDE data set 
Measures  of cortical  thickness  were extracted  from the arpac.stats  
ﬁles as part of the Freesurfer  output of 1051 individuals  in the ABIDE 
data set, separately  for the left and right hemisphere.  As a ﬁrst step, the 
measures  were scanned  for outliers.  A value was marked  as outlier if it 
fell above or beyond  2 inter quartile  ranges from the mean of all values 
for that region and hemisphere.  This quite liberal criterion  was applied  
with the aim to detect not outliers  in a mathematical  sense (+/- 95% 
conﬁdence  interval),  but to detect impossible  values. This led to the 
removal  of 1055 out of 36,785 data points (0.03%)  of all values. The 
number  of 36,785 data points results from 35 Freesurfer  measures  (34 
cortical  regions  and one full hemisphere,  for left and right hemisphere  
each), times 1051 subjects.  After this step, the values of right and left 
hemisphere  for each region were averaged  (in case the value of one 
hemisphere  was missing,  the value of the remaining  hemisphere  was 
considered  to be the average.)  This procedure  was performed  including  
all participants  (control  sample and autism sample,  per region).

1. Introduction  
The mammalian  brain, even in the absence  of explicit  task, operates  
through  the continuous  integration  and segregation  of signals from dif- 
ferent brain areas. Since the landmark  work from Fox and colleagues  in 
2005 ( Fox et al., 2005 ), functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) 
performed  at rest has become  one of the most prominent  methods  to 
investigate  intrinsic  brain activity  and its relationship  with behavior  
or psychopathology  ( Van Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; 
Bolton et al., 2020 ). These task-free  resting-state  paradigms  could poten- 
tially be advantageous  to measure  pathological  brain changes,  as they 
can be readily deployed,  even with patients  unable to match control 
performance  due to motor and cognitive  impairment  ( Krakauer,  2004 ; 
Krakauer,  2007 ). 
Analysis  of resting-state  fMRI (rs-fMRI)  has so far mostly relied 
on measuring  inter-regional  (or voxel- or vertex-level)  connectivity  by 
means of Pearson  correlation  between  time-series  from a set of pre- 
deﬁned  regions  of interest  (a.k.a. static functional  connectivity).  In 
these studies,  information  exchange  between  neuronal  populations  of 
diﬀerent  regions  is assumed  to engender  stronger  statistical  depen- 
dency stationary  over time. Nevertheless,  the human brain is a dy- 
namic system that ﬂuctuates  at the time scale of milliseconds  ( Van Den 
Heuvel and Pol, 2010 ). Therefore,  static connectivity  approaches,  de- 
spite their methodological  simplicity  and ease, may miss features  re- 
ﬂecting  the inherent  dynamic  nature of the brain. In the last decade,  
several time-resolved  approaches  have thus been proposed  to investigate  
the so-called  dynamic  functional  connectivity  (dFC) (see ( Preti et al., 
2017 ) for a review).  They have been demonstrated  to provide  ben- 
eﬁts over static methods,  notably  to study cognition  and psychiatric  
disorders  ( Preti et al., 2017 ; Cohen, 2018 ; Karahano  ğlu and Van De 
Ville, 2017 ; Hutchison  et al., 2013 ). Besides,  deeming  non-stationarity  
enables  a more accurate  description  of the modular  interactions  occur- 
ring between  brain functional  networks  and their anatomical  substrate  
( Bullmore  and Sporns,  2009 ). 
Stroke is one of the major neurological  disorders  in Western  soci- 
eties and a leading  cause of long-term  disabilities.  Ranging  from motor 
to cognitive  deﬁcits,  these disabilities  arise from both focal structural  
changes  (tied to the injury) and widespread  functional  alterations  in 
inter-regional  connectivity  ( Siegel et al., 2016 ; Salvalaggio  et al., 2020 ), 
as theorized  under the concept  of connectional  diaschisis  ( Carrera  and 
Tononi,  2014 ). Structural  and functional  abnormalities  combine  in an 
interdependent  manner  to generate  both deﬁcits  and recovery  processes.  
Considering  the complexity  of these interactions,  time-resolved  FC ap- 
proaches,  which capture  spatial and temporal  properties  of brain net- 
works, could help unravel  the intertwine  between  structural  disrup- 
tions and lesion-induced  dynamic  changes  in large-scale  functional  net- 
works. Coupled  to behavioral  and clinical  assessments,  these methods  
could further elucidate  the nature of pathological  changes  occurring  af- 
ter stroke, possibly  supporting  our understanding  of recovery  processes.  
However,  while moving  from stationary  to dynamic  functional  connec-  
tivity estimates  is an important  methodological  endeavor,  it faces addi- 
tional challenges  such as test-retest  reliability,  which appears  to be even 
more critical for time-tailored  than for classical  methods  ( Cohen, 2018 ; 
Zhang et al., 2018 ). Lack of test-retest  reliability  of fMRI measures  chal- 
lenges the interpretability  of the current  clinical  ﬁndings,  particularly  
with regard to changes  over time. 
Previously,  a handful  of studies have employed  time-tailored  meth- 
ods to explore  the neural correlates  of stroke ( Bonkhoﬀ et  al., 2020 ; 
A.K. Bonkhoﬀet  al., 2021 ; A.K. Bonkhoﬀet  al., 2021 ; Hu et al., 2018 ; 
Obando  et al., 2019 ; Duncan  and Small, 2018 ; Chen et al., 2018 ) show- 
ing evidence  in favor of a dynamic  reconﬁguration  of brain networks  fol- 
lowing stroke. However,  they relied on small sample sizes and focused  
solely on speciﬁc  neurological  symptoms  (i.e., mostly motor deﬁcits),  
limiting  the generalizability  of their ﬁndings  ( Woo et al., 2017 ). Be- 
sides, they relied on a priori selection  of brain regions,  which limits the 
identiﬁcation  of alternative  areas that may be recruited  into a network  ( Carter et al., 2012 ), and on time-windowed  estimates,  which conﬁne  
the investigation  to slow changes  in connectivity  ( Preti et al., 2017 ). 
Here, we leveraged  a recent dynamic  FC framework,  i.e., 
the innovation-driven  coactivation  patterns  (iCAP) framework  
( Karahano  ğlu and Van De Ville, 2015 ; A. Tarun et al., 2020 ; Zöller et al., 
2019 ; D.M. Zöller et al., 2018 ; Zoeller et al., 2019 ; Piguet et al., 2021 ), 
to overcome  these limitations  and investigate  whether  spatial and 
temporal  properties  of large-scale  brain networks  following  stroke cor- 
relate with anatomical  damage  and behavioral  recovery.  Importantly,  
the iCAP method  relies on a data-driven  approach  that employs  single 
frames without  a priori selection  of regions  of interest.  In addition,  it 
includes  a hemodynamic-informed  deconvolution  step, which confers  
to this framework  the unique potential  of identifying  large-scale  brain 
networks  that can be spatially  and temporally  overlapping.  These 
procedures  were previously  demonstrated  to allow disentangling  
the spatiotemporal  organization  of brain ( Karahano  ğlu and Van De 
Ville, 2015 ) and spinal cord activity  ( Kinany et al., 2020 ; Kinany et al., 
2022 ) with a ﬁner level of detail, which is beneﬁcial  to capture  
spatial and temporal  properties  of brain networks.  We applied  the 
iCAP framework  to an extensive  dataset including  healthy  controls  
( n = 19) scanned  in two sessions  at three months  apart and stroke 
patients  ( n = 103) scanned  at diﬀerent  points in time after-lesion  
(i.e., 1–2 weeks, 3 months  and 1 year) and with diﬀerent  neurological  
syndromes  (i.e., ranging  from motor to cognitive  deﬁcits).  Part of the 
data were already  presented  in previous  publications  demonstrating  
the validity  of the dataset ( Siegel et al., 2016 ; Salvalaggio  et al., 2020 ; 
Siegel et al., 2018 ; Griﬃs et al., 2020 ; Griﬃs et al., 2019 ; Corbetta  et al., 
2015 ; Ramsey  et al., 2017 ). We ﬁrst assessed  test-retest  reliability  of 
spatial and temporal  properties  of the extracted  brain networks  in 
the healthy  subjects,  so as to conﬁrm  the robustness  of the metrics  of 
interest.  Building  upon these results,  we then compared  these control 
values with those derived  from the brain networks  of stroke patients.  
While the spatial patterns  of the obtained  large-scale  functional  brain 
networks  were preserved  after stroke, lesions disrupted  their temporal  
durations,  emphasizing  the prospects  of exploiting  time-resolved  fMRI 
methods.  Importantly,  these altered durations  were i) proportional  
to the percentage  of disrupted  white matter ﬁbers; ii) speciﬁc  to the 
neuropsychological  deﬁcit; iii) correlated  with functional  improve-  
ments; and iv) restored  over time proportionally  to the recovery  of 
deﬁcits.  
This is the ﬁrst time that a time-resolved  approach  is deployed  in 
a large cohort of stroke patients,  which were evaluated  longitudinally  
with a comprehensive  set of multi-domain  clinical  assessments.  Using 
the iCAP framework,  we revealed  important  aspects  of post-lesional  re- 
organization  of functional  dynamics,  in relation  to anatomy  and to be- 
havioral  changes.  We posit that understanding  the nature of this rela- 
tionship  is pivotal to grasp the multifaceted  reorganization  mechanisms  
that occur following  stroke, and that are directly  involved  in recovery  
( Woo et al., 2017 ; Haller et al., 2014 ; Allali et al., 2018 ; Ward, 2015 ; 
Guggisberg  et al., 2019 ). 
2. Material  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
All participants  gave their written  informed  consent  to participate  
in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and the study was ap- 
proved by the Institutional  Review  Board at Washington  University  in 
St. Louis. The complete  data collection  protocol  is described  in detail 
elsewhere  ( Corbetta  et al., 2015 ). Part of the data were used in previous  
publications  ( Siegel et al., 2016 ; Salvalaggio  et al., 2020 ; Siegel et al., 
2018 ; Griﬃs et al., 2020 ; Griﬃs et al., 2019 ; Corbetta  et al., 2015 ; 
Ramsey  et al., 2017 ). Data from 127 ﬁrst-time  stroke patients  with 
clinical  evidence  of impairment  and data from 21 demographically  
matched  healthy  controls  were considered  for inclusion  in the analyses  
2  E. Pirondini,  N. Kinany, C.L. Sueur et al. NeuroImage  255 (2022) 119201 
( Table S1 ). Healthy  adults matched  the stroke population  by age, gen- 
der, handedness,  and level of education  (see ( Siegel et al., 2016 ) for de- 
tails in inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  for the two population  groups).  
From the initial sample of 148 subjects,  n = 24 patients  and n = 2 
healthy  subjects  were excluded  from the analysis  because  of excessive  
motion ( > 60% of volumes  with a framewise  displacement  of more 
than 0.5 mm ( Power et al., 2012 )) or because  of a low number  of sig- 
niﬁcant  innovation  frames ( < 131 signiﬁcant  innovation  frames over 
a total of 808 vol). Importantly,  patients  and controls  had compara-  
ble head movements  (mean frame displacement:  0.28 ± 0.009 mm for 
patients  and 0.32 ± 0.03 mm for healthy  subjects,  respectively,  non- 
signiﬁcant  Wilcoxon  Ranksum  Test; and percentage  of volumes  with 
framewise  displacement  of more than 0.5 mm ± STD: 16.11 ± 16.09%  
and 16.55 ± 15.04%,  for patients  and healthy  subjects,  respectively,  
non-signiﬁcant  Wilcoxon  Ranksum  Test). This conﬁrms  that the diﬀer- 
ences found in the iCAP characteristics  are not resulting  from diﬀerences  
in head movement  between  the two groups.  
2.2. Experimental  protocol  
Patients  underwent  a maximum  of three testing sessions  ( Table S1 ): 
within 1–2 weeks ( n = 103), 3 months  ( n = 72), and 12 months  ( n = 54) 
after the lesion (see ( Siegel et al., 2018 ) for motivations  and percent-  
ages of patients  lost over the three time points).  Healthy  control sub- 
jects participated  in two testing sessions  three months  apart in order 
to assess test-retest  reliability  of the extracted  measures.  Each testing 
session consisted  of seven resting state fMRI runs, each including  128 
vol (30 min total) and a neuropsychological  assessment.  Imaging  and 
behavioral  testing sessions  were usually  performed  on the same day.

( Oliviero  et al., 2005 ; Tsang et al., 2014 ). SAI arises in M1-HAND,  be- 
cause the SAI conditioning-test  paradigm  results in a suppression  of 
late TMS-evoked  I-waves  ( Tokimura  et al., 2000 ). The magnitude  of 
SAI displays  somatotopy.  “Homotopic  ”aﬀerent  stimulation  that secures  
spatial correspondence  between  the peripherally  stimulated  aﬀerents  
and the trans-cranially  stimulated  hand muscle results in stronger  SAI 
than “heterotopic  ”a ﬀ e r e n t  stimulation  with a somatotopic  mismatch  
between  the stimulated  aﬀerents  and hand muscle ( Classen  et al., 2000 ; 
Dubbioso  et al., 2017 ; Tamburin  et al., 2001 ). Over the past two decades  
SAI has been used as a tool to explore  and advance  the understanding  
of sensorimotor  integration  at the level of the sensorimotor  cortex. SAI 
has also been widely used to investigate  altered signaling  and probe 
changes  in sensorimotor  function  in neurodegenerative  diseases  such as 
Parkinson´s  disease  ( Dubbioso  et al., 2019 ). 
SAI is commonly  expressed  as the ratio between  MEP amplitudes  
evoked  by conditioned  and unconditioned  TMS pulses, allowing  for 
comparisons  between  diﬀerent  states and groups with unequal  corti- 
comotor  excitability.  Reports  of SAI measured  from the ﬁrst dorsal in- 
terosseus  (FDI) in healthy  humans  range from 20-60%  inhibition  de- 
spite obtained  with comparable  parameter  settings  ( Turco et al., 2018 ). 
The varying  magnitude  of SAI may reﬂect intrinsic  ﬂuctuations  in sen- 
sorimotor  excitability  and may be inﬂuenced  by how conditioned  and 
unconditioned  responses  are intermixed.  This notion is corroborated  by 
previous  studies demonstrating  that single-pulse  MEP amplitudes  are 
modulated  by interstimulus  intervals  suggestive  of long lasting eﬀects 
of previous  stimulation  in the order of seconds  ( Julkunen  et al., 2012 ; 
Pellicciari  et al., 2016 ). Furthermore,  previous  ﬁndings  show that SAI 
interacts  with other excitatory  and inhibitory  intracortical  circuitries  
( Cash et al., 2015 ; Udupa et al., 2014 ), suggesting  that the inhibitory  
eﬀect of aﬀerent  inputs to M1-HAND  may depend  on the “excitabil-  
ity state ”o f other cortical  but possibly  also spinal circuits  that con- 
trol corticomotor  output.  In this study, we tested the hypothesis  that 
the relative  magnitude  of SAI is inﬂuenced  by the way in which af- 
ferent conditioned  and unconditioned  stimulation  are intermixed.  To 
this end, we manipulated  the sensorimotor  context  by delivering  homo- 
and heterotopically  conditioned  and unconditioned  TMS stimuli either 
randomly  intermixed  or repeatedly  in blocks of ﬁve or ten identical  
stimuli.

matrix from sensory  epithelia  or motor pathways.  There is also evidence  
that functions  performed  by ﬁrst-order  relay nuclei are modulated  as a 
function  of the nature of the sensorimotor  information  being processed  
(e.g., Mihai et al., 2021 ; O’Connor  et al., 2002 ). In contrast,  neurons  
in higher-order  relay nuclei are mainly driven by the cerebral  cortex 
and project back to it. Their axons typically  show branched,  point-to-  
multipoint  motifs; creating  circuits  suitable  for signal broadcasting  and 
synchronization  of separate  cortical  regions,  such as those involved  in 
attention,  cognitive  control,  and short-term  memory  ( Aru et al., 2020 ; 
Clascá, 2022 ; Halassa,  2020 ; Mukherjee  et al., 2021 ). In turn, each tha- 
lamic nucleus  receives  reciprocal  connections  from the cortical  areas it 
innervates  ( Briggs, 2020 ; Nieuwenhuys  et al., 2008 ). These corticothala-  
mic pathways  are massive;  about an order of magnitude  more numerous  
that the ascending  thalamocortical  axons. Both axonal systems  remain 
tightly intermingled  as they extend along the internal  capsule  and the so-called  thalamic  radiations  of the cerebral  white matter ( Jones 2007a ; 
Nieuwenhuys  et al., 2008 ). 
Their well-known  and orderly  layout, robust myelination  and lim- 
ited divergence  make the ﬁrst-order  relay nuclei input and output tracts 
ideal subjects  for developing  and testing a reproducible  protocol  to se- 
lectively  obtain and measure  thalamic  white matter pathways.  Here, 
we set out to investigate  the reciprocal  thalamocortical/corticothalamic  
ﬁber tracts originating  in four separate  ﬁrst-order  relay nuclei; namely,  
the ﬁbers from the lateral geniculate  (known  as the optic radiation,  OR; 
Fig. 1 A), from the medial geniculate  (acoustic  radiation,  AR, Fig. 1 B), 
from the ventral posterior  nucleus  (which is part of the superior  tha- 
lamic radiation  and here referred  to as “somatosensory  radiation  ”, SR; 
Fig. 1 C), from the ventral lateral nucleus  (likewise  part of the supe- 
rior thalamic  radiation  and here referred  to as the “motor radiation  ”, 
MR; Fig. 1 D), as well as the main subcortical  input tract of the ventral 
2  M. Liu, G. Lerma-Usabiaga,  F. Clascáet al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119558 
lateral posterior  nucleus,  which originates  in the dentate  nucleus  of the 
cerebellum  (known  as the dentatothalamic  tract, DT; Fig. 1 D). 
Thalamocortical  axons exiting the lateral geniculate  nucleus  (LGN) 
target the primary  (striate)  visual cortex along the banks and lips of the 
calcarine  sulcus, on the medial surface of the occipital  lobe and occipital  
pole ( Fig. 1 A). After leaving  LGN from its rostral aspect, the ﬁbers cross 
the retro- and infralenticular  portions  of the internal  capsule  to pass over 
the roof of the lateral ventricle  temporal  horn and then turn inferolater-  
ally towards  the pole of the temporal  lobe. The inferior  ﬁbers of the OR 
make a sharp loop around the tip of the lateral ventricle  temporal  horn 
and atrium to return posteromedially  forming  what is called Meyer’s  
loop ( Dayan et al., 2015 ; Ebeling  & Reulen,  1988 ; Meyer, 1907 ; Wahler-  
liiek et al., 1991 ). Along their paths, OR ﬁbers preserve  the retinotopic  
ordering  present  in the LGN. Fibers carrying  signals from both eyes re- 
lated to the lower contralateral  visual ﬁeld quadrant  radiate along a 
dorsal and more direct route to terminate  in the upper lip of the cal- 
carine ﬁssure,  with the fovea located  at the occipital  end of the ﬁssure.  
Meanwhile,  the ﬁbers carrying  inputs form the upper quadrant  radiate 
more inferiorly  and take increasingly  looped trajectories,  Axons with 
peripheral  upper quadrant  inputs take the longest  and most anterior  
loop; lesion of these anterior  ﬁbers results in superior  quadrantanopia  
(see Barton et al. 2005 , for a review).  Corticothalamic  axons from V1 
reciprocate  these pathways  in strict topographic  order ( Briggs, 2020 ). 
Axons traveling  from the ventral division  of the medial geniculate  
nucleus  (MGN) to the ipsilateral  primary  auditory  cortex (A1, BA 41, 
and partly 42 in the ﬁrst straight  (Heschl’s)  gyrus of the temporal  op- 
erculum)  form the AR ( Fig. 1 B). These ﬁbers exit from the rostral pole 
of the ventral MGN, turn laterally  to cross the intralenticular  portion  
of the internal  capsule  and ﬁnally fan dorsally  to reach A1. The layout 
of these ﬁbers preserves  the orderly  segregation  present  in the ventral 
MGN of signals related to the predominant  excitation  of speciﬁc  regions  
of the cochlea  ( “tonotopy  ”, see Cherches  2016 ). Functionally,  the AR 
is the gateway  for auditory  information  to the cerebral  cortex; as such, 
these ﬁbers are required  for conscious  sound perception  and for the dis- 
crimination  of speech signals ( Ojemann,  1991 ). 
Neurons  in the ventroposterior  thalamic  complex  (VP) innervate  the 
somatosensory  areas in the posterior  banks and lips of the central sul- 
cus (Brodmann  areas 3, 1 and 2, referred  to collectively  as primary  so- 
matosensory  cortex, S1) in a highly topographic  fashion  ( Fig. 1 C). These 
pathways  convey a diverse  array of tactile, thermal,  nociceptive  and 
proprioceptive  inputs, and each of these sensory  submodalities  is pref- 
erentially  directed  to one of the above areas ( Jones & Friedman,  1982 ). 
Axons from cells in the medial VP subnucleus  relay trigeminal  infor- 
mation from the face and mouth and target the lateral and opercular  
portions  of S1, whereas  axons originating  in the lateral subnucleus  carry 
information  from the hands, arms, trunk and lower limbs and target dor- 
solateral  and medial regions  of S1 (reviewed  in Jones 2007b ). The VP 
axons travel through  the posterior  limb of the internal  capsule  and the 
superior  thalamic  radiation  in close vicinity  to the axons of the ventro-  
lateral (VL) nucleus.  The descending  corticothalamic  axons originating  
in S1 innervate  VP in the same topographic  order ( Nieuwenhuys  et al., 
2008 ). 
The posterior  division  of the ventral lateral nucleus  (VLN) relays in- 
puts from deep cerebellar  nuclei, mainly the dentate  nucleus,  to the pri- 
mary motor cortex (M1, BA4) via the MR ( Ilinsky & Kultas-Ilinsky,  2002 ; 
Fig. 1 D). The order of projections  preserves  the muscular  somatotopy  
present  in each of the deep cerebellar  nuclei ( Jones, 2007b ). Neurons  in 
the medial and ventral part of VLN innervate  the opercular  region of M1 
controlling  mouth and face muscles,  while more latero-dorsally  located  
neurons  innervate  progressively  more dorsal and medial regions  of M1 
controlling  the contralateral  hand and trunk and lower limb muscles  
( Kelly & Strick, 2003 ). 
Inputs from the deep cerebellar  nuclei to the VLN travel via the 
DT ( Fig. 1 D). This ﬁber bundle originates  mainly in the dentate  nu- 
cleus, with smaller  contributions  from the interpositus  and fastigial  
( Jones, 2007b ; Middleton  & Strick, 1997 ; not shown in Fig. 1 D). This ﬁber tract exits the cerebellum  in the superior  peduncle  ( brachium  con- 
junctivum  ) and decussates  to the contralateral  mesencephalic  tegmen-  
tum to ascend medially  to the red nucleus,  where it issues numerous  
short collateral  branches.  The DT ﬁbers ﬁnally enter the VLN from its 
inferolateral  aspect ( Coenen  et al., 2014 ; Kwon et al., 2011 ; Pelzer et al., 
2017 ). At the functional  level, the DT, VLN and MR together  pro- 
vide a low-convergence  and fast-conduction  pathway  that is believed  
to feed M1 high-resolution  error signals about the execution  of mo- 
tor commands.  Such signals are crucial for learning  and ﬂexible  adjust- 
ment of skilled motor behaviors,  including  speech ( Kawai et al., 2015 ; 
Ojemann,  1975 ). Lesions  to the DT can produce  abnormal  movement,  
including  ataxia, tremor,  and dystonia  ( Kwon et al., 2011 ). 
Previous  studies have tried to reconstruct  ﬁrst-order  relay thala- 
mic tracts from in vivo diﬀusion  data using diﬀerent  parameters  for 
the OR (e.g., Bassi et al., 2008 ; Behrens  et al., 2003 ; Benjamin  et al., 
2014 ; Müller-Axt  et al., 2017 ; Sherbondy  et al., 2008 ), for the AR (e.g., 
Behrens  et al., 2007 ; Berman  et al., 2013 ; Javad et al., 2014 ; Maﬀei et al., 
2018 , 2019; Profant  et al., 2014 ; Tschentscher  et al., 2019 ), for the SR 
(e.g., Berman  et al., 2005 ; Kamali et al., 2009 ; Rutland  et al., 2020 ; 
Staudt et al., 2006 ; Sudhyadhom  et al., 2013 ), and for the MR and the DT 
(e.g., Coenen  et al., 2014 ; Hyam et al., 2012 ; Ji et al., 2019 ; Kwon et al., 
2011 ; Meola et al., 2016 ; Nowacki  et al., 2019 ; Sammartino  et al., 2016 ; 
Vo et al., 2015 ). However,  to the best of our knowledge,  no single study 
has tried to reconstruct  all of these ﬁrst-order  relay thalamic  tracts. In 
addition,  as summarized  below, these previous  studies diﬀered  in their 
aims, methodologies  and populations  and have some important  limita- 
tions. 
Several  studies have reported  successful  reconstruction  of OR with 
diﬀusion  data with a variety of approaches  ( Bassi et al., 2008 ; 
Behrens  et al., 2003 ; Benjamin  et al., 2014 ; Sherbondy  et al., 2008 ). 
The reconstruction  methods  and parameters  adopted  in these studies 
diﬀer in several ways, such as the seeding  strategy,  fractional  anisotropy  
threshold,  streamline  length and angle restriction.  Studies  trying to iden- 
tify the AR have encountered  diﬃculties  when using a single ﬁber trac- 
tography  model because  the AR ﬁber group crosses with other ﬁber 
groups,  which results in multiple-orientation  signals in voxels. . For in- 
stance, Behrens  et al’s (2007) study deﬁned  the MGN as a cuboid me- 
dial to the LGN and started tracking  from there to the primary  auditory  
cortex using a probabilistic  algorithm.  In this study they failed to recon- 
struct the AR with single-ﬁber  tractography,  and only succeeded  in do- 
ing so when they used multi-ﬁber  tractography.  In a more recent study, 
Maﬀei et al. (2019) explored  how the DWI acquisition  and tracking  pa- 
rameters  can aﬀect the reconstruction  of the AR. They found that higher 
b-values  and more gradient  directions  increased  the accuracy  of recon- 
struction  for both probabilistic  and deterministic  tracking  algorithms,  
but with low b-values  ( ≤ 3000 s/mm 2 ) only the probabilistic  algorithm  
was able to successfully  reconstruct  the AR. 
The existing  tractography  studies on the SR have mainly focused  
on clinical  and special populations,  such as Parkinson  patients  with 
essential  tremor ( Sudhyadhom  et al., 2013 ), patients  with brain le- 
sions ( Staudt et al., 2006 ), patients  with trigeminal  neuralgia  ( Rutland  
et al., 2020 ) or preterm  born infants ( Berman  et al., 2005 ). Similarly,  
most studies investigating  the MR have focused  on clinical  populations,  
and often on patients  undergoing  deep brain stimulation  (DBS) surgery  
( Andrade  et al., 2020 ; Pouratian  et al., 2011 ; Riskin-Jones  et al., 2021 ; 
Sammartino  et al., 2016 ). These studies reconstructed  only parts of the 
MR depending  on the pathological  conditions  of those patients.  For ex- 
ample, Andrade  et al’s (2020) study reconstructed  part of the MR, using 
the ventral oralis internus  nucleus  as the seed, in patients  who under- 
went DBS surgery  due to Tourette  syndrome.  As the DT travels through  
deep and small nuclei it is diﬃcult  to identify  with DWI techniques.  
There are only a handful  of studies that have successfully  reconstructed  
the DT from DWI data in healthy  ( Kwon et al., 2011 ; Meola et al., 2016 ) 
or clinical  populations  ( Coenen  et al., 2011 , 2014 ; Nowacki  et al., 2019 ). 
Nowacki  et al’s (2019) study tested four diﬀerent  tracking  protocols  to 
identify  the DT, which led to divergent  results.  All four methods  were 
3  M. Liu, G. Lerma-Usabiaga,  F. Clascáet al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119558 
based on deterministic  algorithms,  but no probabilistic  algorithms  were 
tested. Some studies have also reconstructed  the DT and MR as one sin- 
gle tract ( Ji et al., 2019 ; Vo et al., 2015 ). 
The present  study aimed to develop  and test a reproducible  protocol  
for obtaining  all of these ﬁve ﬁrst-order  relay thalamic  input and output 
white-matter  tracts. The novelty  of this protocol  capitalizes  on 4 aspects:  
(1) It is focused  on well-known  white-matter  tracts constituted  by myeli- 
nated axons that originate  and/or target the ﬁrst order relay nuclei of 
the thalamus,  testing them within the same study, and using similar 
methods  and reconstruction  procedures  across them. 2) Diﬀerent  from 
most previous  studies,  here we speciﬁcally  investigated  in a large dataset 
the reliability  of the protocol  in terms of both computational  and test- 
retest reproducibility.  3) The present  protocol  uses state-of-the-art  MRI 
protocols  (multiband,  multi-shell)  and tractography  methods  with the 
aim of developing  an advanced  protocol  that can be applied  to current  
ongoing  studies and future research.  4) The protocol  is designed  to be 
reproducible,  easy to use and automatized,  which unfortunately  has not 
been the norm in the past. Also, it builds on previous  well-validated  tools 
including  the ﬁrst probabilistic  atlas of the thalamus  based on combin-  
ing high-resolution  ex vivo MRI and histology  ( Iglesias  et al., 2018 ) and 
the reproducible-tract-proﬁles  (RTP2) containerized  tool which is based 
on state-of-the-art  techniques  implemented  on top of Vistasoft’s  code, 
which have been tested and used in many publications  over the last 
15 years ( https://www.github.com/vistalab/vistasoft  ; Lerma-Usabiaga  
et al., 2022 ). The ultimate  goal of this work was to provide  a reliable  
protocol  for obtaining  and estimating  ﬁrst-order  relay thalamic  path- 
ways for basic research  and clinical  studies.  
To this end, we ﬁrst deﬁned  multiple  parameters  to optimally  recon- 
struct the above-mentioned  ﬁve thalamic  pathways  (i.e., OR, AR, SR, 
MR and DT; Fig. 1 ) in left and right hemispheres.  Second,  we tested 
the computational  and test-retest  reproducibility  of our protocol  by ex- 
amining  a range of white-matter  proxies  related to the microstructural  
and macrostructural  properties  of these tracts. To examine  the relia- 
bility of the protocol  we obtained  tracts from diﬀusion-weighted  im- 
ages of 113 normal  adults. The protocol  consisted  of three components:  
Deﬁning  the regions-of-interest  (ROI); preprocessing  diﬀusion-weighted  
images (DWI) data; modeling  white-matter  tracts and tractometry.  Re- 
producibility  was tested using two approaches:  1) Computational  repro- 
ducibility  , tested by identifying  each tract using the same parameters  10 
independent  times for all 113 subjects,  and 2) Test-retest  reproducibility  , 
tested by re-scanning  a subset of 24 participants  using the same MRI 
protocol  twice within an average  interval  of 15 days. Our hypothesis  
was that we would obtain a high degree of reproducibility  for the mi- 
crostructural  and macrostructural  properties  of these tracts. However,  
we expected  some variability  in speciﬁc  tracts, and hypothesized  that 
this variability  would be higher for test-retest  than for computational  
reproducibility.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
A total of 113 healthy  volunteers  (mean age = 24.5 years, SD = 4.33 
years; 65 females)  participated  in the study. Twenty-four  of the vol- 
unteers  (mean age = 24.7 years, SD = 4.06 years; 13 females)  re- 
turned for a second session in which they were scanned  using exactly 
the same MRI protocol  (mean interval  = 15 days, SD = 21.82 days, 
range: 7-104 days). All participants  were right-handed  and had nor- 
mal or corrected-to-normal  vision. No participant  had a history of ma- 
jor medical,  neurological,  or psychiatric  disorders.  The study protocol  
was approved  by the Ethics Committee  of the Basque Center on Cogni- 
tion, Brain and Language  (BCBL) and was carried out in accordance  
with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical  Association  (Declara-  
tion of Helsinki)  for experiments  involving  human participants.  Prior 
to their inclusion  in the study, all participants  provided  informed  writ- ten consent.  Participants  received  monetary  compensation  for their 
participation.  
2.2. Data acquisition  
Whole-brain  MRI data acquisition  was conducted  on a 3-T Siemens  
Prisma Fit whole-body  MRI scanner  (Siemens  Medical  Solutions)  using 
a 64-channel  whole-head  coil. The MRI acquisition  included  one T1- 
weighted  structural  image (T1w) and DWI sequences.  High-resolution  
MPRAGE  T1-weighted  structural  images were collected  with the fol- 
lowing parameters:  time-to-repetition  (TR) = 2530 ms, time-to-echo  
(TE) = 2.36 ms, ﬂip angle (FA) = 7°, ﬁeld of view (FoV) = 256 mm, voxel 
size = 1 mm isotropic,  176 slices. In total 100 diﬀusion-weighted  images 
were acquired  with the anterior  to posterior  phase-encoding  direction  
and 50 isotropically  distributed  diﬀusion-encoding  gradient  directions.  
The 100 diﬀusion  weighted  images included  50 images with b-value  of 
1000 s/mm 2 and 50 images with b-value  of 2000 s/mm 2 . Twelve  images 
with no diﬀusion  weighting  (b-value  of 0 s/mm 2 ) were obtained  for mo- 
tion correction  and geometrical  distortion  correction,  which comprised  
ﬁve images with the same phase-encoding  direction  as the DWI images 
and seven images with the reversed  phase-encoding  direction  (posterior  
to anterior).  Both DWIs and b0 images shared the following  parameters:  
TR = 3600 ms, TE = 73 ms, FA = 78°, voxel size = 2 isotropic,  72 slices 
with no gap and a multiband  acceleration  factor of",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5488, 5491), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(18902, 18905), match=' 3.'>"

movements  come to be performed  eﬀortlessly  as a unitary  sequence  
through  repeated  practice.  Ample evidence  indicates  that MSL (a form 
of procedural  memory)  takes place over diﬀerent  phases (e.g., fast [min- 
utes to hours] and slow [hours to days]), with diﬀerent  patterns  of cere- 
bral neuroplasticity  associated  with each (e.g., ( Dayan and Cohen, 2011 ; 
Doyon and Benali, 2005 ; Doyon et al., 2018 ; Lohse et al., 2014 )). Specif- 
ically, changes  in neuronal  activity  in the cortico-cerebellar  and cortico-  
striatal circuits  (in conjunction  with hippocampus)  have been observed  
from the fast to the slow phase as the motor sequence  is being acquired  
and consolidated  ( Lohse et al., 2014 ; Doyon et al., 2009 ; Doyon et al., 
2003 ; Lehericy  et al., 2005 ). 
Yet, an important  question,  largely overlooked  by the neuroimaging  
community  so far, is whether  MSL relies on brain plasticity  alone, or it 
involves  other parts of the central nervous  system (CNS), such as the 
spinal cord. Traditionally,  the spinal cord has been viewed  as a mere 
pathway  for relaying  signals from higher-order  brain regions  to the pe- 
ripheral  eﬀectors,  and from the sensory  cells back to the brain, with a 
limited role in information  processing  ( Bizzi et al., 2000 ). Yet, a large 
body of evidence,  primarily  from animal neurophysiology  research  us- 
ing traditional  learning  paradigms  and lesions studies,  has revealed  that 
spinal neurons  do support  habituation  and sensitization  learning  mecha-  
nisms, as well as Pavlovian  and instrumental  conditioning;  all represent-  
ing proxies  of spinal cord neuroplasticity  ( Grau, 2014 ; Wolpaw,  2007 ). 
Similarly,  there is also accumulating  evidence  from human electrophysi-  
ology studies showing  that spinal motoneurons  excitability  (as measured  
via the Hoﬀmann  H-reﬂex)  can change following  a single motor skill 
training  session,  hence supporting  the hypothesis  that intrinsic  spinal 
cord plastic changes  can be observed  during this form of motor learn- 
ing ( Albuquerque  et al., 2018 ; Meunier  et al., 2007 ; Lungu et al., 2010 ; 
Roche et al., 2011 ; Christiansen  et al., 2017 ). Indeed,  the ﬁrst direct ev- 
idence that MSL relies on neuroplasticity  at diﬀerent  levels of the CNS, 
and that the spinal cord contributes  uniquely  to this process,  has been 
provided  by our group ( Vahdat  et al., 2015 ). In the latter study, we used 
an innovative  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) protocol,  
during which we scanned  the brain and cervical  spinal cord simultane-  
ously, while participants  performed  an MSL task ( Vahdat  et al., 2015 ). 
This simultaneous  brain-spinal  cord fMRI protocol  allowed  us to assess, 
in vivo , the MSL-related  activity  at multiple  CNS levels, and to probe the 
functional  interactions  that develop  between  the spinal and supraspinal  
levels during motor learning.  Importantly,  the results from this study, 
not only revealed  an increase  in blood oxygenation  level dependent  
(BOLD)  spinal cord activity  in C6-C8 spinal segments,  when compar-  
ing the execution  of a complex  vs. simple sequence  of movements,  but 
also for the ﬁrst time, to demonstrate  that this functional  change was in- 
dependent  from that of supraspinal  sensorimotor  structures  known to be 
anatomically  connected  to the spinal cord or involved  in MSL. Finally,  
our ﬁndings  also showed  that the initially  strong functional  connectiv-  
ity between  the spinal cord and sensorimotor  cortices  diminish  with 
learning,  while the connectivity  between  the spinal cord and cerebel-  
lum increase  over the course of the acquisition  process  ( Vahdat  et al., 
2015 ). Altogether,  our results strongly  suggested  that during the fast 
MSL learning  phase, the spinal cord contributes  distinctively  from the 
brain to the motor learning  process.  
In addition  to its role during the early motor skill learning  phase, 
there is evidence  that the spinal cord may also contribute  to the ac- 
quisition  of a more proﬁcient  motor program,  following  additional  
practice  during the slow learning  phase. Several  animal-model  stud- 
ies have indeed provided  direct support  to this long-term  spinal cord 
plasticity  hypothesis  ( Wolpaw,  2007 ; Levine et al., 2012 ; Peters et al., 
2017 ; Ueno et al., 2018 ). In humans,  indirect  evidence  of long-term  
spinal or corticospinal  plasticity  has also been provided  through  sev- 
eral neurophysiological  studies that revealed  a decrease  of amplitude  
in the H-reﬂex  and motor evoked  potentials  in motor skill experts  like 
athletes  and dancers  ( Mynark  and Koceja,  1997 ; Nielsen  et al., 1993 ; 
Ryder et al., 2010 ; Taube et al., 2007 ; Earles et al., 2002 ; Monda et al., 
2017 ; F. Moscatelli  et al., 2016 ; F. Moscatelli  et al., 2016 ). Yet, despite these results,  there is a lack of conclusive  and direct evidence  in hu- 
mans that the spinal cord is involved  in the slow learning  phase of a 
new motor skill due primarily  to the fact that testing using these electro-  
physiological  paradigms  is done oﬄine, and not while subjects  are per- 
forming  the skilled motor behavior  of interest.  Moreover,  unlike fMRI, 
these electrophysiological  techniques  do not provide  a precise localiza-  
tion of the changes  in spinal activity,  nor an assessment  of these changes  
and their interaction  on a large scale at both spinal and supraspinal  
levels. 
To ﬁll this knowledge  gap, we thus employed  our pioneering  simul- 
taneous  brain/spinal  cord fMRI data acquisition  approach  ( Vahdat  et al., 
2015 ; Cohen-Adad  et al., 2010 ; Finsterbusch  et al., 2013 ; Vahdat  et al., 
2020 ) in young healthy  subjects  in order to: ( Dayan and Cohen, 2011 ) 
test the hypothesis  that the spinal cord plays an active role in the slow 
acquisition  phase of a novel sequence  of movements,  and ( Doyon and 
Benali, 2005 ) assess changes  in the spinal cord –brain  functional  con- 
nectivity  occurring  during the early and late phases of motor sequence  
learning.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Thirty young, healthy  subjects  were recruited  to participate  in this 
study. We included  only right-handed  individuals  and excluded  those 
with a history of neurological  or psychiatric  disease,  motor-system  com- 
plications,  use of neurological  medication  or with any MRI-incompatible  
object or material  in their body. We also excluded  individuals  who previ- 
ously participated  in motor-learning  experiments,  as well as those with 
previous  training  in playing  an instrument  for more than three consec-  
utive years in the last ﬁve years. Of the participants  fulﬁlling  all the 
inclusion  and none of the exclusion  criteria,  we subsequently  excluded  
the data from two subjects  who did not come for the training  sessions  
following  the ﬁrst day of scanning,  and from another  subject who had ex- 
cessive movements  (more than 7 mm in plane) during the neuroimaging  
session while executing  the motor task, hence resulting  in failed motion 
correction.  Thus, the ﬁnal sample considered  for analysis  consisted  of 27 
participants  (14 females,  mean ± SD age = 24.85 ± 2.98 years old). The 
ethics committee  at the centre de Recherche  de l’Institut  Universitaire  
de gériatrie  de Montréal  (CRIUGM)  reviewed  and approved  the study 
(protocol  number:  CMER-RNQ  15–16–06).  All participants  gave written  
informed  consent  at the beginning  of the experiment  and were debriefed  
and compensated  for their participation  after having completed  the ex- 
periment.  
2.2. General  procedure  
The study consisted  of 6 testing sessions,  which occurred  daily over 
a period of 6 days. Participants  were scanned  twice; at the beginning  
and at the end of a 6-days motor skill learning  regimen.  On Day 1, par- 
ticipants  were acquainted  with the set-up by practicing  the MSL task 
inside a mock MRI scanner.  The sequence  of movements  practiced  in 
the mock scanner  was diﬀerent  from the other sequence  used during 
the actual experiment.  Following  the participant’s  habituation  with the 
experimental  set-up and task, they were then moved into the actual",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5056, 5059), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8588, 8591), match=' 3.'>"

demonstrated  age-related  changes  in dendritic  length ( Dickstein  et al., 
2013 ), spine number  and type ( Dickstein  et al., 2013 ), synaptic  dy- 
namics ( Mostany  et al., 2013 ), as well as short ( Ou et al., 1997 ) and 
long term synaptic  plasticity  ( Shankar  et al., 1998 ). White matter tracts 
also decline  with age. Fiber tractography  reveals that white matter 
tract integrity  peaks in midlife before gradually  diminishing  with age 
( Yeatman  et al., 2014 ; Hasan et al., 2009 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). 
The mechanisms  by which the observed  synaptic,  neuronal,  and 
white matter tract changes  seen with aging lead to functional  declines  
in behavior  are poorly understood.  One likely consequence  of age- 
associated  synaptic  changes  is disruption  of neuronal  network  activity.  
Deterioration  of large-scale  cortical  networks  with aging may bridge 
the cellular  and molecular  changes  of aging with the behavioral  de- 
cline observed  in aging. Network  level synchronous  brain activity  is 
hypothesized  to coordinate  information  transfer  and contribute  to sen- 
sory and cognitive  functions  ( Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ; Ward, 2003 ). 
Previous  human studies have shown that aging is associated  with sig- 
niﬁcant  changes  to brain spontaneous  activity  and these changes  may 
be indicators  of cognitive  performance  ( Klimesch,  1999 ). Perhaps  most 
compelling,  normal  aging is associated  with a signiﬁcant  and linear de- 
cline in resting state spontaneous  cerebral  activity  in slower frequency  
ranges (0.5–6.5  Hz) and slow wave power in older individuals  is a sig- 
niﬁcant  predictor  of cognitive  performance  ( Vlahou  et al., 2014 ). 
Functional  connectivity  across brain networks  may oﬀer another  im- 
portant  link between  age-related  synaptic  changes  and behavioral  de- 
clines. fMRI-based  resting state functional  connectivity  (FC) studies have 
demonstrated  signiﬁcant  eﬀects of aging on network  connectivity  (re- 
viewed  by Damoiseaux  JS ( Damoiseaux,  2017 )). Among  other changes,  
aging is signiﬁcantly  associated  with decreased  connectivity  in both 
the anterior  and posterior  components  of the default mode network  
( Wu et al., 2011 ). Grady et al. further demonstrated  reduced  connec-  
tivity in the default mode network  as well as increased  inter-network  
connections  for the frontoparietal  control and dorsal attention  networks  
in aged individuals  during tasks ( Grady et al., 2016 ). These and other 
studies strongly  suggest  that normal  aging is associated  with regional  
reorganization  of network  functional  connectivity.  Additionally,  age re- 
lated changes  in FC have been shown to correlate  with behavioral  and 
cognitive  changes  in several domains.  These include  age-related  changes  
in somatomotor  integration  ( Yoshimura  et al., 2020 ), motor learning  
( Mary et al., 2017 ), and memory  ( Sala-Llonch  et al., 2014 ). 
Prior studies of cortical  network  activity  and connectivity  have typ- 
ically utilized  either EEG or fMRI. While EEG studies have relatively  
high temporal  resolution,  they have signiﬁcantly  limited spatial resolu- 
tion ( Burle et al., 2015 ). The EEG signal is limited by nature in recording  
brain-derived  ﬁeld potentials  through  scalp and skull tissue which acts 
to smooth  the recording  and limit spatial resolution  ( Srinivasan  et al., 
1996 ). This limitation  is further exacerbated  by variability  in head size, 
skull thickness,  tissue type, and body temperature  ( McCann  et al., 2019 ). 
Conversely,  fMRI oﬀers better spatial resolution,  but has limited tempo- 
ral range with observations  restricted  to activity  in the infraslow  spectra  
( < 0.08 Hz) ( Anderson,  2008 ). Furthermore,  the BOLD signal measured  
in fMRI studies represents  a vascular,  indirect  measure  of neuronal  ac- 
tivity ( Logothetis  and Wandell,  2004 ). This is an important  confound  
because  numerous  studies have demonstrated  age-related  deteriorations  
in neurovascular  coupling  ( Fabiani  et al., 2014 ; Park et al., 2007 ). 
Here, we seek to address  these limitations  by characterizing  age- 
related changes  in the cortical  network  activity  and connectivity  by 
performing  direct mesoscale  (whole cortex) imaging  of neuronal  net- 
work activity  in young and aged Thy1 -GCaMP6f  transgenic  mice. Pro- 
jection neurons  within these mice produce  a robust ﬂuorescent  signal 
with fast activation  and deactivation  and high signal to noise ratio in 
association  with suprathreshold  neuronal  activity  ( Chen et al., 2012 ; 
Dana et al., 2014 ; Xiao et al., 2017 ). Use of this technique  allows di- 
rect characterization  of age-related  neuronal  network  changes  with high 
temporal  and spatial resolution  ( Brier et al., 2019 ; Wright et al., 2017 ). 
We chose to examine  cortical  networks  via several measures  including  evoked  and spontaneous  activity.  We examined  network  connectivity  
using seed-based  and homotopic  correlations  as well as whole-cortex  
node degree.  While we ﬁrst observed  a global decline  in cortical  spectral  
power, our observations  of functional  connectivity  revealed  a signiﬁcant  
visual and somatomotor  component,  so we quantiﬁed  spontaneous  be- 
havior in aged and young animals  and correlated  these levels to whole- 
cortex spontaneous  activity  and network  connectivity.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Animals  
A total of 33 transgenic  Thy1 -GCaMP6f  mice (Jackson  Laboratories  
C57BL/6J-Tg  (Thy1-GCaMP6f)GP5.5Dkim/J;  Stock Number  024,276)  
were used in this study. 16 (7 female and 9 male) young mice aged (2–3 
months)  and 17 (8 female and 9 male) aged mice (17–18 months)  were 
included  in the study. Ages were chosen as representative  correlates  for 
early adulthood  (approximately  20 years old) and older age (approx-  
imately  60 years) ( Fox, 2007 ). Healthy  aging is associated  with some 
motor ( Studenski  et al., 2011 ) and cognitive  declines  ( Salthouse,  1998 ) 
in the 7th decade of life, so mice correlating  to this age were chosen 
for the aged group. Mice were housed in standard  cages with ad libitum  
access to food and water in a dedicated  animal facility under a 12 hour 
light/12  hour dark cycle. All experimental  protocols  were approved  by 
the Animal  Studies  Committee  at Washington  University  and all stud- 
ies were conducted  in accordance  with the US Public Health Service’s  
Policy on Humane  Care and Use of laboratory  animals.  
2.2. Extracranial  window  placement  
Mice were anesthetized  with inhalation  isoﬂurane  (4.0% induction,  
1.5% maintenance)  and placed into a stereotaxic  head ﬁxation  frame 
(Kopf Instruments,  Tujunga,  CA, USA). Each mouse was placed on a 
heating  pad and temperature  was maintained  at 37 °C via feedback  
from a rectal probe (mTCII Cell Microcontrols,  Norfolk,  VA, USA). The 
head was thoroughly  shaved and cleaned  and a midline  incision  was per- 
formed  as previously  described  ( Brier et al., 2019 ; Wright et al., 2017 ; 
Rosenthal  et al., 2020 ). The scalp was retracted,  and a custom-made  
clear Plexiglas  window  was aﬃxed directly  to the skull using dental ce- 
ment (C & B Metabond,  Parkell,  Edgewood,  NY, USA). Mice were mon- 
itored daily after window  placement.

fects direction  encoding  in the human brain and tested this idea using 
a double-blind  placebo  controlled  intervention  design. Speciﬁcally,  we 
predicted  that oral administration  of L-DOPA,  a dopamine  precursor,  
would inﬂuence  how accurately  walking  direction  can be decoded  from 
multi-voxel  fMRI patterns  in the above named ROIs. 
Next to its role in spatial navigation,  DA has also received  much at- 
tention  in the context  of aging, where reduced  DA functions  are preva- 
lent and are thought  to underlie  age-related  cognitive  declines  ( Bäckman  
et al., 2006; Chowdhury  et al., 2013; Li et al., 2010; Volkow  et al., 
1998 ). Computational  models have shown that declining  neuromodu-  
latory eﬀects of DA lead to losses in the signal-to-noise  ratio of neural 
responses  ( Cohen and Servan-Schreiber,  1992; Servan-Schreiber  et al., 
1990 ), which in the aging brain can lead to neural representations  that 
are less speciﬁc  or “dediﬀerentiated  ”( Li et al., 2001; Li and Rieckmann,  
2014 ). In line with these models,  dediﬀerentiation  has repeatedly  been 
observed  in older adults (OA) at the behavioral  and neural levels ( Carp 
et al., 2011a,b;  Koch et al., 2020; Li et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004 ). 
Neural dediﬀerentiation,  in turn, has been linked to decreased  memory  
performance  ( Koen et al., 2019; Sommer  et al., 2019; St-Laurent  et al., 
2014 ), establishing  an explanatory  link between  DA, neural representa-  
tions and cognitive  aging. 
These roles of DA in spatial navigation  and aging might contribute  
to the pronounced  decline  in spatial cognition  with age ( Lester et al., 
2017; Moﬀat,  2009; Schuck et al., 2015; Wolbers  et al., 2014 ), and to 
the neural dediﬀerentiation  of direction-selective  ( Koch et al., 2020 ) and 
hippocampal  signals ( Schuck et al., 2015 ) in the aging brain. Moreover,  
since the sharp decline  of DA with age should lead to lower baseline  
availability  of DA in OA, the eﬀects of DA might be stronger  in OA rel- 
ative to younger  adults (YA) –reﬂecting  DA’s inverted-U-shape  relation  
to cognitive  performance  ( Cools and D’Esposito,  2011; Li et al., 2010; 
2013; Vijayraghavan  et al., 2007 ). Indeed,  one previous  study found age- 
related eﬀects of the DA receptor  agonist  bromocriptine  on dediﬀeren-  
tiation in the HC ( Abdulrahman  et al., 2017 ). Moreover,  HC-dependent  
episodic  memory,  spatial navigation,  and learning  have been found to 
be aﬀected  by genetic  polymorphisms  related to dopamine  D2 receptor  
availability  (COMT  Val158Met,  C957T CC; Li et al., 2013; Papenberg  
et al., 2014 ) or hippocampal  function  (KIBRA  SNP rs17070145;  Schuck 
et al., 2013; Schuck et al., 2018 ) in OA, but not YA. Based on these 
ﬁndings,  we therefore  also tested whether  L-DOPA  eﬀects on walking  
direction  decoding  would be stronger  in OA relative  to YA. 
Finally,  we expected  that DA could also inﬂuence  the shape of 
population-based  tuning functions  of direction.  Although  direction-  
sensitive  cells often have a preferred  direction,  they also ﬁre in re- 
sponse to non-preferred  directions  in proportion  to their similarity  to 
the preferred  direction  ( Taube, 2007 ). Hence, encoding  of direction  in- 
formation  seems to follow a Gaussian  tuning function,  in particular  on a 
population  level ( Averbeck  et al., 2006 ). Research  has also shown that 
age-related  neural dediﬀerentiation  results in increased  width of such 
tuning functions  with age ( Leventhal  et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2010; 
Schmolesky  et al., 2000 ), which we too have reported  previously  us- 
ing fMRI ( Koch et al., 2020 ). We therefore  also investigated  whether  
L-DOPA  has eﬀects on the precision  of fMRI-derived  tuning functions  of 
direction  information  and whether  such eﬀects may interact  with age. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
This study was part of a larger project in which the same participants  
performed  multiple  tasks, including  a sequential  decision  making  task 
and a virtual reality spatial memory  task inside the scanner  and other 
decision  tasks outside  of the scanner.  
Here, we only report results from the MRI analysis  of the VR 
task described  below. Speciﬁcally,  following  our previous  publication  
( Koch et al., 2020 ), our analyses  were speciﬁc  to neural representations  
of direction  signals during the spatial memory  task performed  while un- dergoing  fMRI. Other data from the same participants  was not within 
the purview  of this study and was therefore  not investigated.  Data of 
102 participants  which were recruited  for two MRI sessions  and ran- 
domly assigned  to one of the two drug intervention  groups (i.e., L-DOPA  
–Placebo  or Placebo  –L-DOPA)  was available  for investigating  our re- 
search question.  Eighty-eight  of these participants  (43 OA, 45 YA) suc- 
cessfully  completed  both sessions  without  technical  errors. Four addi- 
tional OA were excluded  from further analyses  because  they did not 
respond  in at least a third of the trials in at least one of the two ses- 
sions. Decoding  analyses  of the L-DOPA  eﬀects introduced  additional  
requirements  for the distribution  of walking  direction  (see Materials  and 
Methods)  that were not met for four participants  (2 OA, 2 YA). Thus, the 
ﬁnal eﬀective  sample for these analyses  also excluded  these participants  
and comprise  of a total of 37 OA (age 65–75, 6 female)  and 43 YA (age 
26–35, 16 female).  
Note that the relatively  low number  of female OA reﬂects  diﬃculties  
in recruitment  after the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic.  
2.2. Virtual reality task 
During each session of fMRI data collection  participants  had to com- 
plete a similar variant of a spatial memory  task that was used in previous  
studies ( Schuck et al., 2015; Thurm et al., 2016 ). Analyses  of the present  
work are mainly concerned  with directional  signals obtained  during free 
navigation,  and hence focus on the corresponding  task phases.  Specif- 
ically, to avoid eﬀects of changed  environmental  cues on directional  
signals (e.g. Taube et al., 1990 ) or initial learning,  we considered  only 
data from the feedback  phase for this study (see below).  On average,  the 
included  data reﬂected  a period of 17.36 min from free navigation  per 
session.  
Brieﬂy,  participants  were placed in a virtual,  circular  arena in which 
they could move around freely using a custom-made  MRI-compatible  
joystick.  The arena consisted  of a circular  grass plane surrounded  by a 
wall. Participants  could also see distal cues (mountains,  clouds)  as well 
as a local cue (traﬃc cone) to aid orientation  (see Fig. 1 ). We asked par- 
ticipants  to remember  the location  of ﬁve objects within the 360 ◦arena. 
First, an initial encoding  phase took place in which participants  could 
see and walk to the locations  of all objects appearing  one after the other. 
Learning  of object location  then continued  in a feedback  phase: partici-  
pants were placed close to the center of the arena with a random  heading  
direction.  After the brief presentation  of a grey screen and ﬁxation  cross, 
a picture of the ﬁrst object was shown. Participants  were asked to navi- 
gate as closely as possible  to the location  of this object and indicate  their 
ﬁnal position  with a button press within a maximum  of 60 s. To provide  
feedback,  the true object location  was shown to participants  following  
their response,  and they were then asked to navigate  to and walk over 
the shown location.  After the feedback,  participants  were shown an- 
other object and the procedure  repeated  without  placing  the player in 
the center of the arena until all ﬁve objects were completed.  The order 
in which the ﬁve objects were shown was pseudo-randomized.  Once all 
ﬁve objects were completed,  participants  were again placed close to the 
arena’s center and had to navigate  to all ﬁve objects in the same manner  
for a total of six repetitions  (i.e., 5 ×6 = 30 feedback  trials). In a ﬁnal 
transfer  phase of the task (data not analyzed  in this study, see above),  
either the arena size or the location  of the traﬃc cone were altered,  and 
participants‘  object location  memory  was tested again as above. For the 
second session participants  had to learn the location  of ﬁve diﬀerent  
objects,  but the trial structure  and procedures  were identical  otherwise.  
Completing  one session took participants  between  14 and 49 min.

acoustic  perceptive  cortex, and project to increasingly  developed  corti- 
cal regions  via dorsal and ventral anatomical  routes, which correspond  
to two processing  pathways:  a dorsal ‘where/  when’ pathway  versus 
a ventral ‘what’ pathway  ( Macko et al., 1982 ; Romanski  et al., 1999 ). 
However,  it is the combination  of these two cognitive  processes  in dor- 
sal and ventral systems  that permits  integration  of meaning  with se- 
quences.  “When presented  with sets of strings,  humans  have both a ca- 
pacity and proclivity  to infer hierarchical  structures  whenever  possible  ”
( Fitch, 2014 ,restating  George Miller’s  conclusion  as the Supra-Regular  
hypothesis  for human cognition),  even when the sensory  input is se- 
quentially  presented  or the output is a sequence  of actions.  It has indeed 
been observed  that humans  do not simply associate  each successive  item 
with the next one with a particular  delay, but they also grasp abstract  
multi-item  sequential  structures  ( Dehaene  et al., 2015 ). The faculty to 
combine  sequences  with abstract  content  is labelled  syntax (from the 
ancient  Greek words ‘syn’ (together)  and ‘taxis’ (order)).  
Existing  cognitive  models for auditory  or language  processing  de- 
scribe two parallel  streams  for reciprocal  exchange  between  frontal 
cortex and the back of the brain ( Rauschecker  and Scott, 2009 ; 
Hickok and Poeppel,  2004 ). Such dual stream models are also pro- 
posed in various  other domains  as action and tool use ( Binkofski  and 
Buxbaum,  2013 ; Vry et al., 2015 ), arithmetic  ( Willmes  et al., 2014 ) or 
music ( Belin and Zatorre,  2000 ; Musso et al., 2015 ). They are also found 
in the right hemisphere  ( Corbetta  and Shulman,  2002 ; Umarova  et al., 
2010 ; Oechslin  et al., 2018 ). We suggest  that various  cognitive  do- 
mains may resort to similar computational  abilities  of the two systems  
( Weiller  et al., 2011 ; Rijntjes  et al., 2012 ). Thus, we propose  a dual- 
loop model comprising  two bidirectional  loops that interact  with each 
other in anterior  and posterior  parts of the brain, and serve as the neural 
substrate  for the regulation  of syntax in all cognitive  domains  by pop- 
ulating sequences  with content  ( Dehaene  et al., 2015 ). Our dual-loop  
model is based on neuroanatomy  and deﬁned  by those dorsal and ven- 
tral tracts that converge  on pre- and post-rolandic  hubs, giving rise to 
a closed loop within the brain. A closed-loop  allows the internal  inter- 
action of the two processing  streams,  categories  in the ventral system 
and sequences  in the dorsal system,  in the perceptive  cortex located  in 
the posterior  part of the brain as well as in the execution-related  frontal 
cortex. Such a loop enables  prospection  and planning  by simulating  the 
eﬀects of eﬀectors,  without  overt behaviour  or external  feedback.  
That is why we chose to focus on these particular  large tract sys- 
tems that connect  the pre- and post-rolandic  cortices.  The cortical  in- 
teraction  sites of two such large, integrating,  segregated  brain systems  may be described  as ‘hubs’. In the computational  neuroscience  ﬁeld, 
hubs are deﬁned  numerically  as network  nodes with a high number  of 
connections  (and features  like path length or centrality)  ( Bullmore  and 
Sporns,  2012 ). More generally,  ‘hubs’ are described  as brain regions  that 
have a central role in supporting  integrated  brain function  ( Oldham  and 
Fornito,  2019 ). The present  study used connectivity  analyses  to identify  
the anatomical  locations  where this interaction  takes place. 
Testing  the dual-loop  model requires  a conceptually  diﬀerent  
experimental  approach.  A good brain model should take into ac- 
count coordinates,  which are invariant  and independent  of defor- 
mations,  and organize  units across rostro-caudal  and dorso-ventral  
axes ( Nieuwenhuys  and Puelles,  2016 ). Modern  comparative  geno- 
architecture,  single cell- mRNA sequencing  and transcriptomic-based  
brain architecture  models adhere to this axiom ( Medina  et al., 2021 ; 
Colquitt  et al., 2021 ). The dual-loop  model refers to the two most in- 
variant anatomical  coordinates  of the brain, namely  (i) the trajectory  of 
the central sulcus, which forms a rostro-caudal  axis by separating  the 
cerebral  cortex into anterior  (frontal  lobe) and posterior  (parietal,  tem- 
poral and occipital  lobes) parts, and, (ii) the lateral (Sylvian)  ﬁssure,  
which establishes  the dorso-ventral  axis by dividing  the cortex into dor- 
sal and ventral parts ( Fig. 1 ). Distributed  brain systems  comprise  cor- 
tical regions  and connecting  ﬁbre tracts. The integrating  regions  must 
be cortical,  since processing  cannot be carried out by the tracts per se ; 
therefore,  we searched  for tracts as candidates  for segregation.  In their 
decades-long  studies in rhesus monkeys,  Pandya  and co-workers  deﬁned  
long association  tracts and attributed  them to either dorsal or ventral 
trends ( Pandya  et al., 2015 ). AF (arcuate  fascicle)  and SLF (superior  
longitudinal  fascicles)  are classiﬁed  as belonging  to the dorsal trend, 
as both travel above the Sylvian  ﬁssure (‘dorsal’).  Tracts through  the 
extreme  capsule,  i.e., UF (uncinate  fascicle),  ECF (extreme  capsule  fas- 
cicle) and IFOF (inferior  fronto-occipital  fascicle)  belong to the ventral 
trend ( Weiller  et al., 2021 ). We only looked for tracts that connect  the 
frontal lobe with the posterior  lobes in line with the rostro-caudal  axis, 
and because  integration  of information  from perceptive  brain regions  
(posterior)  has to be combined  with that from executive  (anterior)  parts 
to form complete  loops. We thus ﬁrst identiﬁed  the separate,  composite  
dorsal and ventral association  tract streamlines  using advanced  diﬀusion  
MRI (dMRI)  based ﬁbre tracking.  We explicitly  chose a strategy  which 
deviates  from the prevailing  reductionist  approach  to increasingly  ﬁnely 
structured  individual  tracts. As a second new feature we introduced  a 
conjunction  analysis  of streamlines  of the two diﬀerent  tract systems.  
This allowed  us to determine  the cortical  termination  maps of conju- 
Fig. 1. Deﬁnition  of dorsal and ventral streamlines.  Two bottlenecks  containing  anterior/posterior  traversals  of streamlines  (green in RGB mode) on coronal slices 
at the level of the central sulcus of unrestricted  global tracking  were used to deﬁne ROIs. Annotation  to dorsal or ventral occurred  with respect to the horizontal  
Sylvian ﬁssure (s.f.). Ventral streamlines  (left) are best deﬁned at the anterior/inferior  part of the extreme  capsule (left and middle picture: spherical  ROI in red with 
radius 1mm at MNI coordinates  (+-31,3,-10))(Weiller  et al., 2021). For the dorsal streamlines  (blue) a manually  deﬁned triangular  white matter ROI (blue) was 
used (middle and right).

gated dorsal and ventral streamlines.  The results led to the identiﬁca-  
tion of hubs, which are cortical  regions  connected  with each other along 
both the dorsal and ventral streamlines,  constituting  a closed-loop  in the 
brain.

that movement  artifacts  can contaminate  intracranial  LFP recordings  ac- 
quired to study the neural control of speech production.  
Neural activity  in the high gamma  frequency  band (60–200  Hz) 
tracks speciﬁc  features  of speech perception  and production.  For ex- 
ample, increased  power in the high gamma  frequency  range has been 
observed  in the superior  temporal  gyrus in response  to auditory  stimuli 
( Crone et al., 2001 ; Hamilton  et al., 2018 ; Mesgarani  et al., 2014 ), and 
in Broca’s  and motor cortices  during speech production  ( Edwards  et al., 
2010 ; Flinker et al., 2015 ; Mugler et al., 2018 ). High gamma  activity  
recorded  from the Rolandic  cortex (pre and postcentral  gyri) has been 
shown to track articulatory  and/or acoustic  features  of speech sounds 
( Bouchard  et al., 2013 ; Cheung  et al., 2016 ; Chrabaszcz  et al., 2019 ; 
Conant  et al., 2018 ). Some recent advances  have even made it possible  
to reconstruct  speech from the brain’s activity  in the high gamma  band 
( Anumanchipalli  et al., 2019 ; Martin et al., 2019 ; Moses et al 2021 ), 
pointing  at its potential  utility for brain-computer  interfaces  to develop  
speech prostheses.  Contamination  of the neural signal with audio acous- 
tics therefore  is a potential  barrier to decoding  the true electrophysio-  
logical correlates  of speech production.  
Given the impact that speech dysfunction  can have in patients  with 
movement  disorders,  and the fact that the role of subcortical  regions  
in speech production  are not well understood,  we recently  developed  a 
strategy  to simultaneously  record from the cortex and the subcortical  
implantation  target during DBS surgery.  With the patient’s  consent,  it is 
possible  to temporally  place an electrocorticography  (ECoG)  electrode  
strip on the surface of the brain, a technique  that has been used safely in 
over 500 patients  ( Panov et al., 2017 ; Sisterson  et al., 2021 ). Here, we re- 
port the systematic  identiﬁcation  and quantiﬁcation  of speech-induced  
artifacts  in several types of intracranial  electrophysiological  recordings  
obtained  using a speech production  task performed  during DBS implan-  
tation surgery.  We show that this artifact  is caused by mechanical  vi- 
brations  induced  by the produced  speech,  and that it can also be found 
in a ’blank’ headstage  pin not connected  to any electrode.  The results 
presented  in this study encourage  careful assessment  of possible  audio- 
induced  artifacts  in intracranial  recordings  obtained  during speech pro- 
duction  research.  Additionally,  we provide  suggestions  for data collec- 
tion and analysis  that may reduce the potential  for false discoveries.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Participants  were English-speaking  patients  with Parkinson’s  disease  
(21 M/8F, age: 65.6 ± 7.1 years, duration  of disease:  6.1 ± 4.1 years) un- 
dergoing  awake stereotactic  neurosurgery  for implantation  of DBS elec- 
trodes in the subthalamic  nucleus  (STN). Dopaminergic  medication  was 
withdrawn  the night before surgery.  All procedures  were approved  by 
the University  of Pittsburgh  Institutional  Review  Board (IRB Protocol  
#PRO13110420).  All patients  provided  informed  consent  to participate  
in the study. 
2.2. Behavioral  task 
Participants  performed  a syllable  triplet repetition  task intraoper-  
atively,  repeating  aloud sequences  of CV syllables  presented  audito- 
rily through  earphones.  Triplets  were presented  at either low ( ∼50 dB 
SPL) or high ( ∼70 dB SPL) volume  and participants  were instructed  to 
produced  them at matching  volume.  Phonetic  coding of the produced  
speech audio was done manually  for all participants.  See supplemen-  
tary materials  for details.

a predeﬁned  set of viable image types and do not properly  adapt to 
inputs outside  this set. For example,  skull-stripping  tools developed  for 
near-isotropic,  adult brain images may perform  poorly when applied  to 
infant subjects  or clinical  scans with thick slices, such as stacks of 2D 
fast spin-echo  (FSE) acquisitions.  
When a suitable  brain extraction  method  is not available  for a par- 
ticular scan type, a common  workaround  involves  skull-stripping  a 
compatible  image of the same subject and computing  a co-registration  
to propagate  the extracted  brain mask to the target image of inter- 
est ( Iglesias  et al., 2011 ). Unfortunately,  an accurate  intra-subject  align- 
ment can require  signiﬁcant  manual  tuning because  the target image still 
includes  extra-cerebral  matter that may impede  linear registration  qual- 
ity ( Reuter et al., 2010 ). Crucially,  this procedure  also requires  the exis- 
tence of an additional,  strip-able  image, often a high-resolution  isotropic  
T1w or T2-weighted  (T2w) scan, which is rare, for example,  in clini- 
cal screening  protocols,  introducing  a barrier to the clinical  adoption  of 
analysis  tools. 
While classical  algorithms  for skull-stripping  are limited by their 
assumptions  about the spatial features  and intensity  distributions  in 
the input images,  supervised  deep-learning  approaches,  which leverage  
convolutional  neural networks  (CNNs),  can, in principle,  learn to ex- 
tract a region of interest  from any image type given suﬃcient  anatom-  
ical contrast  and resolution.  In practice,  these networks  achieve  high 
accuracy  for data types observed  during training,  but their perfor- 
mance often deteriorates  on images with characteristics  unseen during 
training  ( Hendrycks  et al., 2021; Hoﬀmann  et al., 2021b; Jog et al., 
2019; Karani et al., 2018 ). In consequence,  robust, supervised  learning-  
based approaches  depend  on the availability  of a representative  training  
dataset that contains  accurate  ground-truth  annotations  and exposes  the 
network  to a landscape  of image types. While numerous  public datasets  
provide  access to widely used MRI acquisitions  for which target brain 
masks can be easily derived  with classical  methods,  curating  a diverse  
training  dataset with uncommon  sequences  and suﬃcient  anatomical  
variability  is a challenging  task that requires  substantial  human eﬀort. 
As a result, current  deep-learning  skull-stripping  methods  are trained  
with few diﬀerent  data types and deliver state-of-the-art  results only for 
particular  subsets of image characteristics  ( Hwang et al., 2019; Kleesiek  
et al., 2016; Salehi et al., 2017 ). 
Recently,  a novel learning  strategy  alleviates  the requirement  for 
representative  acquired  training  data by optimizing  networks  with a 
wide array of synthetic  images,  each generated  directly  from a pre- 
computed  label map ( Billot et al., 2020; Hoﬀmann  et al., 2021b ). 
This synthesis  scheme  enables  networks  to accurately  carry out tasks 
on any image type at evaluation-time  without  ever sampling  real tar- 
get acquisitions  during training,  and it has been eﬀectively  employed  
for segmentation  ( Billot et al., 2020 ) and deformable  image registra-  
tion ( Hoﬀmann  et al., 2021b ). To build on deep-learning  methods  for 
brain extraction  while addressing  their shortcomings,  we adapt the syn- 
thesis technique  and introduce  SynthStrip,  a ﬂexible  brain-extraction  
tool that can be deployed  universally  on a variety of brain images.  By 
exposing  a CNN to an arbitrary  and deliberately  unrealistic  range of 
anatomies,  contrasts,  and artifacts,  we obtain a model that is agnostic  
to acquisition  speciﬁcs,  as it never samples  any real data during train- 
ing. Consequently,  this scheme  enables  SynthStrip  to extract the brain 
from a wide array of neuroimaging  data types, and we demonstrate  its 
viability  and improvement  over popular  baselines  using a varied test 
set that spans both research  scans and clinical  exams ( Fig. 1 ). The test 
set includes  T1w, T2w, T2w ﬂuid attenuated  inversion  recovery  (T2- 
FLAIR),  and proton-density  (PDw) contrasts  as well as clinical  FSE scans 
with slices and high in-plane  resolution,  and low-resolution  EPI, ranging  
across age and pathology.  We demonstrate  the ability of SynthStrip  to 
generalize  beyond  structural  MRI, to MR angiography  (MRA),  diﬀusion-  
weighted  imaging  (DWI), ﬂuorodeoxyglucose  positron  emission  tomog- 
raphy (FDG-PET),  and even computed  tomography  (CT). We make our 
validation  set publicly  available  to promote  further development  and 
evaluation  of brain-extraction  tools. 2. Related  work 
In this section,  we brieﬂy review the automated  brain-extraction  
techniques  that we use as baseline  methods.  We include  both classi- 
cal and deep-learning  baselines  introduced  over the last two decades,  
focusing  in particular  on those with high eﬃcacy  and popularity  in the 
research  domain.  For an exhaustive  overview  of skull-stripping  meth- 
ods, see Fatima et al., 2020 . 
2.1. Classical  skull-stripping  
Classical,  or traditional,  algorithms  that remove  non-brain  image sig- 
nal vary substantially  in their implementation  ( Cox, 1996; Eskildsen  
et al., 2012; Iglesias  et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2017; Ségonne  et al., 2004; 
Shattuck  et al., 2001; Smith, 2002 ). One common  class of approaches  
leverages  a deformable  mesh model to reconstruct  a smooth  boundary  
of the brain matter surface.  The widely-used  Brain Extraction  Tool (BET; 
Smith, 2002 ), distributed  as part of the FSL package  ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ), utilizes  this technique  by initializing  a spherical  mesh at the 
barycenter  of the brain and projecting  mesh vertices  outwards  to model 
the brain border.  Since BET uses locally adaptive  intensity  thresholds  
to distinguish  brain and non-brain  voxels, it generalizes  to a variety of 
contrasts,  such as T1w, T2w, and PDw. To prevent  surface leaks beyond  
the brain boundary,  3dSkullStrip,  a component  of AFNI ( Cox, 1996 ), 
extends  the BET strategy  by considering  information  on the surface ex- 
terior, accounting  for eyes, ventricles,  and skull. 
The popular  hybrid approach  ( Ségonne  et al., 2004 ) available  in 
FreeSurfer  also leverages  a deformable  surface paradigm,  combing  it 
with a watershed  algorithm  and statistical  atlas to improve  robustness.  
First, the watershed  establishes  an estimate  of the white-matter  mask, 
which is then reﬁned to the brain boundary  using a surface mesh expan- 
sion. A probabilistic  atlas of intensity  distributions  helps prevent  out- 
liers during mesh ﬁtting, and erroneous  brain mask voxels are removed  
during post-processing  via a graph cuts algorithm  ( Greig et al., 1989; 
Sadananthan  et al., 2010 ) that thresholds  the cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF). 
While eﬀective,  this technique  is optimized  only for images with T1w 
contrast,  since it relies on the underlying  assumption  that white matter 
is surrounded  by darker gray matter and CSF. Another  hybrid approach,  
ROBEX  ( Iglesias  et al., 2011 ), exploits  a joint generative-discriminative  
model. A Random  Forest classiﬁcation  ( Breiman,  2001 ) detects the brain 
contour,  which is used to ﬁt a point-distribution  model to the brain tar- 
get. The skull-stripping  tool BEaST ( Eskildsen  et al., 2012 ) builds on 
patch-based,  non-local  segmentation  techniques  ( Coupé et  al., 2010; 
2011; Roy et al., 2017 ) and assigns a label to each voxel by compar-  
ing its local neighborhood  to patches  in a reference  set with prior la- 
bels. With the exception  of BET and 3dSkullStrip,  all of these tools were 
speciﬁcally  developed  for T1w images.  
2.2. Deep-learning  approaches  
Innovations  in deep-learning  have gained popularity  as method-  
ological  building  blocks for an array of tasks in medical  image analy- 
sis, including  skull-stripping.  Various  learning-based  extraction  meth- 
ods have been proposed,  demonstrating  accuracy  and speed that often 
out-perform  their classical  counterparts.  These models are optimized  in 
a supervised  fashion,  using a set of acquired  training  images with cor- 
responding  ground-truth  brain masks, derived  through  classical  meth- 
ods or manual  segmentation.  An early, cross-contrast  approach,  Deep 
MRI Brain Extraction  (DMBE)  ( Kleesiek  et al., 2016 ), trains a 3D CNN 
on combinations  of T1w, T2w, and FLAIR contrasts  and matches  the 
accuracy  of classical  baselines  for several datasets,  including  clinical  
scans with brain tumors.  Conversely,  Auto-Net  ( Salehi et al., 2017 ) in- 
troduces  two separate  2.5D architectures  that skull-strip  volumes  by in- 
dividually  segmenting  sagittal,  coronal,  and transverse  views of same 
image and fusing the predictions  with an auto-context  algorithm  ( Tu and

Fig. 1. Examples  of SynthStrip  brain extractions  (bottom)  for a wide range of image acquisitions  and modalities  (top). Powered  by a strategy  for synthesizing  diverse 
training  data, SynthStrip  learns to skull-strip  brain images of any type. 
Bai, 2009 ). The ﬁrst architecture  leverages  convolutions  on single- 
resolution  voxel-wise  patches,  while the second utilizes  a scale-space  
U-Net architecture  ( Ronneberger  et al., 2015 ) to predict the brain mask. 
Auto-Net  is eﬀective  for both adult and neonatal  brain scans but only 
trained  with T1w images.  CONSNet  ( Lucena et al., 2019 ) similarly  lever- 
ages a 2D U-Net, applied  across image slices in each plane, to strip 3D 
T1w images.  More recently,  implementations  using full 3D U-Nets ( Hsu 
et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2019 ) have robustly  matched  or exceeded  
start-of-the-art  brain-extraction  performance.

Recently,  brain age has emerged  as a concept  for estimating  bi- 
ological  aging in the general  population  ( Cole and Franke 2017 ; 
Liem et al. 2017 ; Dosenbach  et al. 2010 ). Biological  aging can be 
inferred  from the genome  via telomere  length, mitochondrial  func- 
tion, epigenetics  and other cellular  features  ( Ferrucci  et al. 2020 ; 
Mather  et al. 2011 ). Yet, the age of a person is only a noisy mea- 
sure of these cellular  processes  (people  of the same chronological  age 
can have diﬀerent  biological  ages). At the same time, biological  ag- 
ing aﬀects brain structure  and function,  inducing  loss of brain volume  
( Driscoll  et al. 2009 ; Scahill et al. 2003 ) and characteristic  changes  
in neuronal  activity  ( Cabeza  et al. 2002 ; Damoiseaux  et al. 2008 ; 
Babiloni  et al. 2006 ). A proxy of biological  aging can, thus, be obtained  
by mapping  chronological  age to brain data from large populations  of 
subjects  using machine  learning  ( Liem et al. 2017 ; Dadi et al. 2021 ). The 
resulting  models can be used to compute  an expectation  of a person’s  
age given her brain data. This is achieved  by quantitatively  comparing  
that person’s  brain data to the distribution  of brain data across diﬀer- 
ent ages within the general  population.  This statistical  expectation  can 
tell how old (or young) a brain “looks ”( Spiegelhalter  2016 ), hence, pre- 
dicting the risk of neurological  complications  potentially  more precisely  
than the chronological  age. 
This empirical  measure  of biological  aging derived  from the general  
population  has proven a useful marker  of neurodegeneration  and cogni- 
tive decline  in clinical  populations  ( Cole et al. 2018 ; Raﬀel et al. 2017 ; 
Denissen  et al. 2021 ; Gonneaud  et al. 2021 ). In these cohorts,  pa- 
tients typically  appear to have older brains than their chronological  
age would suggest.  Importantly,  similar trends emerge  when evaluat-  
ing brain age in the general  population  where elevated  brain age, com- 
pared to chronological  age, has been associated  with lower cognitive  
capacity,  well-being,  and general  health ( Dadi et al. 2021 ; Cole 2020 ; 
Wrigglesworth  et al. 2021 ). Yet, so far, this approach  has mainly been 
based on anatomical  brain scans and hemodynamic  signals obtained  
from magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI). This limits the broad utility of 
brain age for public health, as cerebral  MRI scans are usually  collected  
when there is an indication,  which can be too late. Even when people 
from the general  population  are motivated  to participate  in brain re- 
search, this only concerns  a small fraction  of society:  MRI devices  and 
neuroscientiﬁc  studies are not equally  accessible  in all regions  of the 
world and do not attract all people equally  from within society,  poten- 
tially leading  to selection  bias ( Fry et al. 2017 ). 
New hope to generalize  this approach  has been sparked  by ad- 
vances in large-scale  modeling  of biomedical  outcomes  from non- 
invasive  electrophysiological  data including  magnetoencephalogra-  
phy (MEG) and electroencephalography  (EEG) ( Gaubert  et al. 2019 ; 
Engemann  et al. 2018 ). This line of research  in clinical  neurology  
may help develop  assessments  of brain health in many additional  
contexts  in which MRI cannot be applied.  First MEG-based  brain- 
age models have allowed  to validate  MEG-derived  brain age against  
MRI-derived  brain age. Results from several studies have shown that 
the MEG- and MRI-derived  brain-age  estimates  are statistically  re- 
lated ( Engemann  et al. 2020 ; David Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ; Xifra- 
Porxas et al. 2021 ). This overlap  can be explained  by electromag-  
netic ﬁeld spread,  independently  of neuronal  activity:  As brain struc- 
ture changes  due to aging, cortical  activity,  even if unchanged,  will 
project diﬀerently  onto the M/EEG  sensor array, making  age indirectly  
decodable  ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ). Importantly,  multiple  articles  have 
found that neuronal  activity  captured  by MEG adds speciﬁc  informa-  
tion not present  in MRI-derived  brain age ( Engemann  et al. 2020 ; Xifra- 
Porxas et al. 2021 ), leading  to improved  prediction  performance  and 
richer neurocognitive  characterization  ( Engemann  et al. 2020 ). 
While MEG can provide  an important  discovery  context,  it is un- 
likely to be the right instrument  for addressing  the availability  issues 
of MRI-based  brain age as MEG scanners  are even rarer than MRI 
scanners.  In this context,  EEG can make a true diﬀerence  as EEG is 
economical  and allows for ﬂexible  instrumentation  for neural assess- 
ments in a wide range of clinical  and real-world  situations  including  at- home assessments.  First evidence  suggests  that MEG-based  strategies  for 
brain-age  modeling  can be translated  to EEG. In an earlier publication  
( Engemann  et al. 2020 ) we found that among many alternative  features  
of varying  data-processing  complexity,  the spatial distribution  of corti- 
cal power spectra  in the beta (13-30Hz)  and alpha (8-13Hz)  frequency  
band explained  most of the MEG’s performance  as brain-age  regressor.  
This type of information  can be well accessed  without  source localiza-  
tion from the sensor-space  covariance  using spatial ﬁltering  approaches  
or Riemannian  geometry  ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ; Sabbagh  et al. 2019 ), 
which has led to successful  translation  of this MEG-derived  strategy  
to clinical  EEG with around 20 electrodes  ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ). In 
clinical  and real-world  contexts  in which EEG is frequently  collected,  
ﬁne-grained  spatial information  may not be present  as only a few elec- 
trodes are used. This has favored  alternative  EEG-derived  brain-age  
models focusing  on a wealth of spectral  and temporal  features  ( Al Zoubi 
et al. 2018 ) which may perform  better on sparse EEG-montages  and has 
enabled  sleep-based  brain age measures  ( Sun et al. 2019 ; Ye et al. 2020 ). 
These results provide  a sense of the ﬂexibility  and future potential  
of EEG-based  brain age as a widely applicable  real-world  measure  of 
brain health. Yet, to fully develop  this research  program,  more and 
richer evidence  is desirable.  At this point, comparisons  between  dif- 
ferent machine  learning  strategies  are diﬃcult.  Most models were not 
only developed  and validated  in one speciﬁc  context,  but their imple- 
mentations  and data-processing  routines  are dataset-speciﬁc.  Moreover,  
general  machine  learning  approaches  successful  at pathology  decoding  
should be well-suited  for brain age modeling  too, yet they have never 
been tested for that purpose  ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ; Banville  et al. 2020 ; 
Engemann  et al. 2018 ). This makes it hard to know whether  any strat- 
egy is globally  optimal  and where speciﬁc  strategies  have their preferred  
niche. As a result, uncertainty  is added to comparisons  between  MEG, 
EEG and MRI, slowing  down eﬀorts of validating  M/EEG-based  brain 
age. Finally,  to mitigate  the impact of selection  bias concerning  the 
subjects  investigated,  it will be crucial to analyze  many, socially  and 
culturally  diverse  M/EEG  datasets  and ﬁnd representations  that are in- 
variant to confounding  eﬀects that can raise issues of fairness  and racial 
bias if remaining  unaddressed  ( Choy, Baker, and Stavropoulos  2021 ). 
To develop  the next generation  of M/EEG-derived  brain age models,  to 
facilitate  processing  of larger numbers  of diverse  M/EEG-data  resources  
and to avoid fragmentation  of research  eﬀorts, standardized  software  
and reusable  benchmarks  are needed.  
In this paper we wish to make a ﬁrst step in that direction.  We pro- 
vide reusable  brain-age-prediction  benchmarks  for diﬀerent  machine  
learning  strategies  validated  on multiple  M/EEG  datasets  from diﬀerent  
countries.  Our benchmarks  come in the form of readily usable, yet, easily 
adaptable  Python scripts for computing  brain age models and comparing  
their results.  These scripts should not be taken as fully developed  soft- 
ware but as practical  templates  for kick-starting  future studies on brain 
age and biomarker  learning  on new datasets  beyond  the ones covered  
in this study. To facilitate  reproducibility  and usability,  the benchmarks  
are built on top of well documented  open-source  software  (MNE, PyRie- 
mann, braindecode,  scikit-learn)  and The benchmarks  are built on top 
of highly standardized  dataset-agnostic  code enabled  by the BIDS stan- 
dard ( Gorgolewski  et al. 2016 ; Niso et al. 2018 ; Appelhoﬀet  al. 2019 ). 
This makes the benchmarks  easy to extend in the future for additional  
datasets.  The paper is organized  as follows.  The method  section mo- 
tivates the choice of the diﬀerent  machine  learning  benchmarks.  The 
general  data processing  approach  and software  developed  for this con- 
tribution  are presented  in the context  of the benchmark.  The selec- 
tion of datasets  is motivated,  and datasets  are then described  in detail 
and compared  regarding  key ﬁgures that could provoke  diﬀerences  be- 
tween benchmarks.  Dataset-speciﬁc  processing  steps and peculiarities  
are highlighted.  Then a model validation  strategy  is developed.  The 
results section presents  benchmarks  on prediction  performance  across 
machine  learning  models and datasets  and diﬀerent  performance  met- 
rics. The discussion  inspects  diﬀerences  between  models,  modalities,  
and datasets,  identifying  unique niches, safe bets as well as unresolved

challenges.  The work concludes  with practical  suggestions  on additional  
benchmarks  that can be readily explored  and extended  by the commu-  
nity in future studies using the proposed  tools and resources.  The scripts 
and library code for this benchmark  are publicly  available  on GithHub  1 
and latest benchmark  results (updated  in real time) next to the conﬁg 
ﬁles specifying  the analysis  can be inspected  on a dedicated  website  2 . 
Methods  
Brain age benchmarks  
Many diﬀerent  approaches  exist for ML in neuroscience,  and it can be 
hard to select among them. The following  categorization  may help ori- 
ent practical  reasoning  and study design. What varies in the taxonomy  
of methods  discussed  below is how much M/EEG  data are statistically  
summarized  before being presented  to the learning  algorithm.  In other 
words, ML methods  vary with respect to the extent to which compres-  
sion and summary  of the M/EEG  signals is performed  by the learning  
algorithm  vs. feature-deﬁning  procedures  performed  before and inde- 
pendently  of the machine  learning  algorithm.  
A-priori  deﬁned,  a.k.a. handcrafted,  features  
The ﬁrst category  represents  approaches  in which features  are in- 
spired by theoretical  and empirical  results in neuroscience  or neu- 
ral engineering.  Here, M/EEG  is summarized  in a rigid fashion  by 
global aggregation  across sensors,  time, and frequencies  or by visit- 
ing speciﬁc  regions  of interest  ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ; Sitt et al. 2014 ; 
Engemann  et al. 2018 ). A meaningful  composition  of features  requires  
prior knowledge  of the (clinical)  neuroscience  literature,  especially  
when interpretation  of the model is a priority.  In practice,  it is con- 
venient  to extract all or the most relevant  features  discussed  in a given 
ﬁeld, apply multiple  spatial and temporal  aggregation  strategies,  and 
then bet on the capacity  of the learning  algorithm  to ignore irrelevant  
features  ( Sitt et al. 2014 ). This motivates  the use of tree-based  algo- 
rithms like random  forests ( Breiman  2001 ) that are easy to tune, can 
ﬁt nonlinear  functions  (higher-order  interaction  eﬀects),  and are rela- 
tively robust to the presence  of uninformative  features.  As local methods  
that can be seen as adaptive  nearest  neighbors  ( Hastie et al. 2005 ), the 
predictions  of random  forests and related methods  are bounded  by the 
minimum  and maximum  of the outcome  in the training  distribution.  
For clinical  neuroscience  applications,  this has proven to yield robust 
oﬀ-the-shelf  prediction  models that are relatively  unaﬀected  by noise in 
the data and in the outcome  ( Engemann  et al. 2018 ). This approach  is 
also a natural  choice when using sparse EEG-montages  with few elec- 
trodes. 
Here we implemented  a strategy  pursued  in ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ) and 
( Banville  et al. 2020 ), aiming at a broad set of diﬀerent  summary  statis- 
tics of the time-series  or the power spectrum.  This approach  has turned 
out useful for a pathology  detection  task in which the labeling  of EEG 
as pathological  can be due to diﬀerent  clinical  reasons,  hence, aﬀecting  
many diﬀerent  EEG signatures  in potentially  diﬀuse ways. Features  were 
computed  using the MNE-features  package  ( Schiratti,  Le Douget,  Van 
Quyen,  et al. 2018 ). More speciﬁcally  we used as features  (each com- 
puted for individual  channels  and concatenated  across channels,  and 
then averaged  across epochs):  the standard-deviation,  the kurtosis,  the 
skewness,  the diﬀerent  quantiles  (10%, 25%, 75%, 90%), the peak-to-  
peak amplitude,  the mean, the power ratios in dB among all frequency  
bands (0 to 2Hz, 2 to 4Hz, 4 to 8Hz, 8 to 13Hz, 13 to 18Hz, 18 to 24Hz, 
24 to 30Hz and 30Hz to 49Hz), the spectral  entropy  ( Inouye et al. 1991 ), 
the approximate  and sample entropy  ( Richman  and Moorman  2000 ), the 
temporal  complexity  ( Roberts,  Penny, and Rezek 1999 ), the Hurst expo- 
nent as used in ( Devarajan  et al. 2014 ), the Hjorth complexity  and mo- 
bility as used in ( Päivinen  et al. 2005 ), the line length ( Esteller,  Echauz,  
1 https://github.com/meeg-  ml- benchmarks/meeg-  brain- age- benchmark-  paper 
2 http://meeg-ml-benchmarks.github.io/brain-age-benchmark-paper  et al. 2001 ), the energy of wavelet  decomposition  coeﬃcients  as pro- 
posed in ( Teixeira  et al. 2011 ), the Higuchi  fractal dimension  as used in 
( Esteller,  Vachtsevanos,  et al. 2001 ), the number  of zero crossings  and 
the SVD Fisher Information  (per channel)  ( Roberts,  Penny, and Rezek 
1999 ). 
Covariance-based  ﬁlterbank  approaches  
This category  represents  approaches  in which the spatial dimension  
of M/EEG  is fully exposed  to the model, whereas  temporal  or spectral  
aspects  of the signal are to some extent summarized  before modeling.  As 
M/EEG  signals reﬂect linear superposition  of neuronal  activity  projected  
to the sensors  through  linear ﬁeld/potential  spread,  it is natural  to use 
linear (additive)  models for adaptively  summarizing  the spatial dimen- 
sion of M/EEG  signals ( King et al. 2018 ; Stokes, Wolﬀ, and Spaak 2015 ; 
King and Dehaene  2014 ). This intuition  is driving  the success  of linear 
decoders  for evoked  response  analysis  but faces additional  challenges  
when applied  to power spectra  ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ). Computing  power 
features  on M/EEG  sensor-space  signals renders  the regression  task a 
non-linear  problem  for which linear models will provide  sub-optimal  re- 
sults ( Sabbagh  et al. 2019 ). In practice,  this can be overcome  by extract-  
ing nonlinear  features  like spectral  power after anatomy-based  source 
localization,  or in a data-driven  fashion  that does not require  availability  
of individual  MRI scans. Spatial ﬁltering  techniques  provide  unmixing  of 
brain sources  based on statistical  criteria  without  using explicit  anatom-  
ical information,  which has led to supervised  spatial ﬁltering  pipelines  
(de Cheveignéand  Parra 2014 ; Dähne et al. 2014 ). Another  related strat- 
egy consists  in computing  features  that are invariant  to ﬁeld spread.  This 
can be achieved  by Riemannian  geometry,  an approach  ﬁrst applied  to 
M/EEG  in the context  of brain computer  interfaces  but that has also 
proven eﬀective  for biomarker  learning  ( Barachant  et al. 2012 ; Yger, Be- 
rar, and Lotte 2017 ; Rodrigues,  Jutten, and Congedo  2019 ). These ap- 
proaches  have in common  to favor the covariance  of M/EEG  sensors  as a 
practical  representation  of the signals.  Manipulating  the covariance  al- 
lows one to suppress  the eﬀects of linear mixing while, at the same time, 
exposing  the power spectrum  and the spatial structure  of neuronal  ac- 
tivity in each frequency  band ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ). To scan along the 
entire power spectrum,  one computes  covariances  from several narrow-  
band signals covering  low to high frequencies  ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ). 
This provides  spatially  ﬁne-grained  information  of frequency-speciﬁc  
neuronal  activity,  hence the term ﬁlterbank  . 
Here we implemented  the ﬁlterbank  models from ( Sabbagh  
et al. 2020 ; Sabbagh  et al. 2019 ) based on Riemannian  geometry  that 
were found to provide  a practical  alternative  to MRI-based  source lo- 
calization,  although  falling slightly  behind in terms of performance.  
This may be explained  by the model violations  arising from computing  
the Riemannian  embedding  across multiple  participants.  The Rieman-  
nian embedding  assumes  constant  linear ﬁeld spread but each record-  
ing comes from a diﬀerent  head and diﬀerent  sensor locations,  which, 
on the other hand, is explicitly  modeled  when computing  individual-  
speciﬁc  source estimates.  It is an open question  whether  template-based  
source localization  can improve  upon the Riemannian  pipeline,  observ-  
ing that in the case of MEG such a procedure  would be informed  by 
the head position  in the MEG dewar. Both average  brain templates  and 
Riemannian  embeddings  mitigate  ﬁeld spread in a global way with the 
diﬀerence  that the average  template  uses some anatomical  information  
and approximate  sensor locations  in the context  of MEG, whereas  the 
Riemannian  embeddings  are a purely data-driven  procedure  with some 
whitening  based on the average  covariance  (across subjects).  
To evaluate  the beneﬁt of a template-based  anatomy,  we included  a 
ﬁlterbank  model using source localization  based on the fsaverage  sub- 
ject from FreeSurfer  ( Fischl 2012 ). The forward  model was computed  
with a 3-layer Boundary  Element  Method  (BEM) model. Source spaces 
were equipped  with a set of 4098 candidate  dipole locations  per hemi- 
sphere.  Source points closer than 5mm from the inner skull surface 
were excluded.  The noise covariance  matrices  used along with for- 
ward solutions  to compute  minimum-norm  estimates  inverse  operators  
3  D.A. Engemann,  A. Mellot, R. Höchenberger  et al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119521 
were taken as data-independent  diagonal  matrices.  Diagonal  values de- 
faulted to the M/EEG-speciﬁc  expected  scale of noise (obtained  via the 
“make_ad_hoc_cov  ”function  from MNE-Python).  All computations  were 
done with MNE ( Gramfort  et al. 2014 , 2013 ). For computational  eﬃ- 
ciency, source power estimates  were obtained  by applying  the inverse  
operators  to the subjects’  covariance  data (MNE-Python  function  “ap- 
ply_inverse_cov  ”). Dimensionality  reduction  was carried out with a par- 
cellation  containing  448 ROIs ( Khan et al. 2018 ). This procedure  closely 
followed  the one from ( Engemann  et al. 2020 ), with the diﬀerence  that 
here an MRI template  was used instead  of subject-speciﬁc  MRIs. Finally,  
the 448 ROI-wise  source power estimates  represented  as diagonal  matri- 
ces were the inputs of the log-diag  pipeline  from ( Sabbagh  et al. 2020 ; 
Sabbagh  et al. 2019 ). Features  were computed  using the coﬀeine  pack- 
age 3 . 
Deep learning  approaches  
This category  concerns  modeling  strategies  in which the outcome  
is mapped  directly  from the raw signals without  employing  separate  a 
priori feature-deﬁning  procedures.  Instead,  multiple  layers of nonlinear  
but parametric  transformations  are estimated  end-to-end  to successively  
summarize  and compress  the input data. This process  is controlled  by 
supervision  and enabled  by a coherent  single optimization  objective.  In 
many ﬁelds, emerging  deep learning  methods  keep deﬁning  the state 
of the art in generalization  performance,  often outperforming  humans.  
Deep learning  models are however  greedy for data, and it may take hun- 
dreds of thousands  if not millions  of training  examples  until these mod- 
els show a decisive  advantage  over classical  machine-learning  pipelines.  
Applied  to neuroscience,  where the bulk of datasets  is small to medium-  
sized, deep learning  models may or may not outperform  classical  ap- 
proaches  ( Poldrack,  Huckins,  and Varoquaux  2020 ; Schulz,  Thomas  Yeo, 
et al. 2020 ; Roy et al. 2019 ; He et al. 2020 ). The success  of using a deep- 
learning  model may, eventually,  depend  on the amount  of energy and 
resources  invested  in its development  ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ). 
Apart from high performance  on standard  laboratory  M/EEG  
datasets  and decoding  tasks, deep learning  models are attractive  for 
other reasons.  First, when very speciﬁc  hypotheses  about data gen- 
erators or noise generators  are available  ( Kietzmann,  McClure,  and 
Kriegeskorte  2019 ). In this setting,  the model architecture  can be 
designed  to implement  this knowledge,  e.g., to explicitly  extract 
frequency-related  power features  in a motor decoding  task. Second,  
these models have a strategic  advantage  when the data generating  mech- 
anism is not known at all, hence, few hypotheses  about classes of fea- 
tures are available  ( Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ). In this setting,  mod- 
els with a generic  architecture  can learn and identify  relevant  features  
themselves  without  requiring  expert knowledge  of the researcher.  With 
neural architecture  search and automated  hyperparameter  optimiza-  
tion, there is also intense  research  to even reduce the amount  of expert 
knowledge  needed  to create the network  architecture  itself. This ﬂexi- 
bility has led neuroscientists  to discover  the framework  as a vector for 
hypothesis-driven  research  probing  brain functions  and neural compu-  
tation ( Yamins  and DiCarlo  2016 ; Bao et al. 2020 ). At the same time, this 
ﬂexibility  is equally  beneﬁcial  under complex  environmental  conditions  
that degrade  the quality of M/EEG  recordings  (e.g. real-world  record-  
ings outside  of controlled  laboratory  conditions),  in which the classes 
of relevant  features  are not a priori known and deep learning  models 
can exploit the structure  of the data and noise sources  to provide  robust 
predictions.  ( Banville  et al. 2021 ). 
Based on prior work, here we benchmarked  two battle-tested  general  
architectures  ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ) implemented  using the Braindecode  
package  4 ( Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ; Gramfort  et al. 2013 ). Braindecode  
is an open-source  library for end-to-end  learning  on EEG signals.  It is 
closely intertwined  with other libraries.  One of them is Mother  of all BCI 
3 https://github.com/coﬀeine-labs/coﬀeine  
4 https://braindecode.org  Benchmarks  (MOABB)  ( Jayaram  and Barachant  2018 ), which allows for 
convenient  EEG-data  fetching,  MNE ( Gramfort  et al. 2013 , 2014 ), imple- 
ments well established  data structures,  preprocessing  functionality,  and 
more. A second key dependency  is Skorch ( Tietz et al. 2017 ), which im- 
plements  the commonly  known scikit-learn  ( Pedregosa  et al. 2011 ) API 
for neural network  training  ( Buitinck  et al. 2013 ). For these reasons,  
Braindecode  is equally  useful for EEG researchers  who desire to apply 
deep learning  as well as for deep learning  researchers  who desire to work 
with EEG data. Braindecode  builds on PyTorch  ( Paszke et al. 2019 ) and 
comprises  a zoo of decoding  models that were already  successfully  ap- 
plied to a wide variety of EEG decoding  classiﬁcation  and regression  
tasks, such as motor (imagery)  decoding  ( Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ; 
Kostas and Rudzicz  2020 ), pathology  decoding  ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ; 
van Leeuwen  et al. 2019 ; Tibor Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ), error de- 
coding ( Völker et al. 2018 ), sleep staging  ( Chambon  et al. 2018 ; 
Perslev  et al. 2021 ), and relative  positioning  ( Banville  et al. 2020 ). 
For this benchmark  and the task of age regression  we used two 
Convolutional  Neural Networks  (ConvNets,  sometimes  abbreviated  
CNNs) ( LeCun et al. 1999 ) namely  ShallowFBCSPNet  (BD-Shallow)  
and Deep4Net  (BD-Deep)  ( Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ). BD-Shallow  was 
inspired  by the famous  ﬁlter bank common  spatial pattern  (FBCSP)  
( Ang et al. 2008 ) algorithm.  Initially,  it has two layers that represent  
a temporal  convolution  as well as a spatial ﬁlter. Together  with a squar- 
ing and logarithmic  non-linearity  it was designed  to extract frequency-  
speciﬁc  power features.  Of note, in the present  context  this architecture  
is closely related to SPoC ( Dähne et al 2014 ) and, in therefore,  in prin- 
ciple, has the capacity  to deliver consistent  regression  models as was 
formally  proven in previous  work ( Sabbagh  et al 2020 ). 
In contrast,  BD-Deep  is a much more generic  architecture.  In total, 
it has four blocks of convolution-max-pooling  and is therefore  not re- 
stricted  to any speciﬁc  features.  While BD-Deep  has around 276k train- 
able parameters  and has therefore  more learning  capacity,  BD-Shallow  
has only about 36k parameters.  
It is important  to note, that we did neither  adjust the model architec-  
tures (apart from those changes  required  by the regression  task) nor run 
task-speciﬁc  hyperparameter  optimization.  Both ConvNets  were used as 
implemented  in Braindecode  with hyperparameters  that were already  
successfully  applied  to pathology  decoding  from the TUH Abnormal  EEG 
Corpus ( Gemein  et al. 2020 ; van Leeuwen  et al. 2019 ; Tibor Schirrmeis-  
ter et al. 2017 ). For more information  on Braindecode  or the Con- 
vNets, please refer to the original  publication  ( Schirrmeister  et al. 2017 ). 
For decoding,  we converted  the MEG input data from Tesla to Fem- 
totesla,  the EEG input data from Volts to Microvolts.  Additionally,  each 
dataset was rescaled  separately  by dividing  each of its recordings  by 
its global channel  standard  deviation  (i.e., the standard  deviation  com- 
puted across all recordings),  such that each dataset has roughly  zero 
mean and unit variance  (see Section  Datasets).  
General  data processing  strategy  using BIDS and the MNE-BIDS  
pipeline  
Neuroimaging  and behavioral  data are stored in many diﬀerent  
complex  formats,  potentially  hampering  eﬀorts of building  widely us- 
able methods,  hence, impeding  reproducible  research.  Our goal was 
to provide  brain-age  prediction  models that can be directly  applica-  
ble to any new electrophysiological  dataset.  For this purpose,  we used 
the Brain Imaging  Data Structure  (BIDS) ( Gorgolewski  et al. 2016 ) 
which allows us to organize  neuroimaging  data in a standardized  way 
supporting  interoperability  between  programming  languages  and soft- 
ware tools. We used the MNE-BIDS  software  ( Appelhoﬀ et  al. 2019 ) 
for programmatically  converting  M/EEG  datasets  into the BIDS format 
( Pernet et al. 2019 ; Niso et al. 2018 ). This has allowed  us to access all 
datasets  included  in this work in the same way, enabling  data analysis  
for all these datasets  with the same code. We will now summarize  the 
general  workﬂow  (cf. Fig. 1 ) .

Fig. 1. Data processing,  feature extraction  and model construction  based on the BIDS standard.  This benchmark  project provides  a common  data processing  
and feature extraction  code allowing  comparisons  of diﬀerent  classical  and deep learning-based  machine  learning  models across diﬀerent  M/EEG datasets.  Support 
for new datasets  can be added with minimal  modiﬁcations.  For a detailed  description  consider  the main text and the open-source  code repository  supporting  this 
article ( https://github.com/meeg-  ml- benchmarks/meeg-  brain- age- benchmark-  paper ). 
For this study, we used the MNE-BIDS-Pipeline  for automatic  prepro-  
cessing of MEG and EEG data stored in BIDS format 5 ( Jas et al. 2018 ). 
Its main advantage  is that we can implement  various  custom  analy- 
ses for diﬀerent  datasets  without  having to write any elaborate  code. 
Modifying  the overall processing  pipeline  or adapting  a given pipeline  
to a new dataset only requires  few edits. Controlling  the pipeline  is 
achieved  through  dataset-speciﬁc  conﬁguration  ﬁles that specify the de- 
sired processing  steps and options  of the MNE-BIDS-Pipeline  while deal- 
ing with the peculiarities  of the data. The MNE-BIDS-Pipeline  scripts 
themselves  do not need to be modiﬁed  and are readily applicable  on 
diverse  datasets.  
We designed  conﬁguration  ﬁles to implement  data processing  steps 
common  to all datasets  analyzed  in this benchmark  while handling  
dataset-speciﬁc  details.  Raw signals bandpass-ﬁltered  between  0.1 and 
49Hz using a zero-phase  ﬁnite impulse  response  (FIR) ﬁlter with Ham- 
ming window.  Window  length and transition  bandwidth  were auto- 
matically  controlled  by default settings  of MNE-Python  (v0.24).  Like 
all preprocessing  parameters,  epoching  can be easily adjusted  to needs 
of a particular  study via the dataset-speciﬁc  conﬁg ﬁles. We consid-  
ered epochs of 10-second  length without  overlap.  These epochs coin- 
cided with eyes-closed  or eyes-open  resting-state  conditions  in some 
of the datasets.  As additional  channels  measuring  ocular and cardiac  
activity  were not consistently  available  across datasets,  we only im- 
plemented  amplitude-based  artifact  rejection  using the local autoreject  
method  ( Jas et al. 2017 ). Through  5-fold cross-validation,  autoreject  
chose channel-speciﬁc  rejection  peak-to-peak-amplitude  thresholds  and 
then decided  if a given epoch could be repaired  using interpolation,  or 
if it should be rejected  to obtain clean data. We kept the default grid 
of candidate  values for the hyperparameters  ‘rho’ (the consensus  pro- 
portion  of bad channels  leading  to rejection  of an epoch) and ‘kappa’  
(maximum  number  of channels  allowed  to be interpolated).  For ‘rho’ 
we considered  a linearly  spaced grid of 11 points between  0 and 1. For 
‘kappa’  we considered  1, 4, or 32 channels.  As the local autoreject  is not 
yet supported  in the MNE-BIDS  pipeline,  this step was implemented  in a 
custom  script (see the “compute_autoreject.py  ”in the code repository).  
This script could be easily edited to implement  alternative  artifact  clean- 
ing methods  (e.g. RANSAC,  Bigdely-Shamlo  et al. 2015 ) or even omitted  
to probe the impact of preprocessing  on model predictions.  Apart from 
preprocessing,  we also made use of the MNE-BIDS-Pipeline  to generate  
forward  solutions  and inverse  operators  for the source localization  ap- 
proach based on template  MRI (see section Covariance-based  ﬁlterbank  
approaches  for detailed  explanations).  
5 https://github.com/mne-  tools/mne-  bids- pipeline  Each model of the benchmark  is based on features  extracted  from 
clean epochs.  Again, the conversion  of datasets  to BIDS has enabled  
feature extraction  using one general  script for all datasets  ( “com- 
pute_features.py  ”in the code repository).  
Datasets  
Large datasets  and biobanks  are the backbone  of population  model- 
ing. In the past 10 years, this has led to a wealth of publications  in cogni- 
tive neuroscience  on modeling  biomedical  outcomes  and individual  dif- 
ferences  in cognition  from MRI data ( Kernbach  et al. 2018 ; Cole 2020 ; 
Smith et al. 2015 ). This has been enabled  by consortia  and large-scale  
institutional  collaborations  ( Bycroft  et al. 2018 ; Van Essen et al. 2013 ) 
that aim at recontextualizing  existing  data for open-ended  future us- 
age ( Leonelli  2016 ). More recently,  the ﬁrst M/EEG  datasets  have 
emerged  with a focus on characterizing  populations  ( Taylor et al. 2017 ; 
Larson-Prior  et al. 2013 ; Babayan  et al. 2019 ; Obeid and Picone 2016 ; 
Niso et al. 2016 ; Valdes-Sosa  et al. 2021 ; Bosch-Bayard  et al. 2020 ). The 
selection  of datasets  for the present  study did not aim at comprehensive-  
ness but represents  an attempt  to secure a minimum  degree of diversity.  
Social bias and fairness  are important  challenges,  not only in the ﬁeld 
of machine  learning  but also in biomedical  research.  It has been shown 
for modern  biobanks  that the sample deviates  from the general  popu- 
lation in important  ways, oversampling  Caucasian  people with higher 
education  degrees  ( Fry et al. 2017 ; Henrich  and Heine 2010 ). For de- 
ployment  of predictive  biomarkers,  this can have tragic consequences  
as clinical  utility may depend  on sex and ethnicity  ( Duncan  et al. 2019 ). 
As a result, in EEG research,  speciﬁc  risks of racial bias have been recog- 
nized lately, highlighting  the risk of selection  bias and confounding,  e.g., 
due to culture-speciﬁc  hair style ( Choy, Baker, and Stavropoulos  2021 ). 
Taken together,  this emphasizes  the importance  of benchmarking  on 
socially  and culturally  diﬀerent  datasets.  Our selection  includes  M/EEG  
datasets  from four diﬀerent  countries  representing  culturally  and socioe- 
conomically  diverse  contexts.  To support  construction  of valid brain age 
models we focussed  either on datasets  sampled  from the general  popu- 
lation of healthy  volunteers  or on subsets of clinical  EEG data that were 
labeled  as non-pathological  by medical  experts.  In the following  we will 
provide  a high-level  introduction  to the datasets,  highlighting  character-  
istic diﬀerences,  challenges  and opportunities  for unique benchmarks.  
Cam-CAN  MEG data 
The Cambridge  Centre of Ageing and Neuroscience  (Cam-CAN)  
dataset ( Taylor et al. 2017 ; Shafto et al. 2014 ) has been the starting  
point of our eﬀorts in building  brain age models ( Engemann  et al. 2020 ;

WM white matter 1. Introduction  
Characterizing  the macroscopic  structural  organization  of brain con- 
nectivity  in vivo is central to understanding  the human nervous  sys- 
tem in health and disease.  The advent of diﬀusion  magnetic  resonance  
imaging  (dMRI)  ﬁber tractography  (FT) more than twenty years ago en- 
abled signiﬁcant  progress  in mapping  major white matter (WM) ﬁber 
bundles  described  in anatomical  and surgical  literature.  Initial work 
based on Diﬀusion  Tensor Imaging  (DTI) ( Basser et al., 1994a , 1994b ; 
Mori et al., 1999 ) drove the development  of white matter dissection  
protocols  ( Catani, 2006 ; Mori et al., 2009 , 2008 ; Wakana  et al., 2007 ), 
which are still widely used today. This is because  DTI is a simple 
and eﬀective  approach  for reconstructing  the core of large fasciculi  
( Catani et al., 2002 ; Stieltjes  et al., 2001 ), data acquisition  for DTI 
modelling  requires  a relatively  short scan time (5–10 min) and stan- 
dard pulse sequences  are widely available  owing to their regulatory  
approval  for clinical  practice.  However,  it is widely accepted  that DTI 
suﬀers limitations  that make it suboptimal  for many tractography  ap- 
plications,  particularly  in a clinical  setting ( Farquharson  et al., 2013 ; 
Mori and Tournier,  2014 ; Tournier  et al., 2011 ). This has led to in- 
creased  interest  in more accurate  and reliable  approaches  using high an- 
gular resolution  imaging  (HARDI)  data ( Bayrak et al., 2020 ; Bloy et al., 
2012 ; Wasserthal  et al., 2018 ; Yeh et al., 2018 ). At the same time, 
technological  advances  to accelerate  data acquisition  and reconstruc-  
tion, such as multiband  ( Bouyagoub  et al., 2020 ; Duan et al., 2015 ; 
Larkman  et al., 2001 , p. 1; Moeller  et al., 2010 ) and compressed  sens- 
ing ( Lustig et al., 2008 , 2007 ) in combination  with improved  com- 
putational  eﬃciency,  will increase  the adoption  of advanced  recon- 
struction  models in applications  traditionally  reserved  for DTI. This 
means that there is a need for updated  reference  material  based on 
more representative  virtual dissections  using HARDI data acquired  on 
3T scanners.  
Automated  approaches  relying on anatomical  and orientational  pri- 
ors have been shown to considerably  improve  the accuracy  of tract 
representations  ( Rheault  et al., 2019 ) and address  the poor repro- 
ducibility,  and operator  dependency  that confound  the manual  vir- 
tual dissection  process  ( Kreilkamp  et al., 2019 ; Maﬀei et al., 2021 ; 
Soares et al., 2013 ).There  are currently  only a limited number  of ap- 
proaches  that automate  the virtual dissection  process  from start to ﬁn- 
ish ( Warrington  et al., 2020 ; Wasserthal  et al., 2018 ; Yendiki  et al., 
2011 ). However,  often the underlying  dissection  protocol  is not ex- 
plicitly detailed  or the workﬂow  is based on model bundles  deﬁned  a 
priori. 
This work addresses  both the currently  unmet need for an up- 
dated HARDI human white matter atlas that is relevant  for clinical  
research  studies,  and a standardized,  reproducible  virtual dissection  
approach  based on anatomical  deﬁnitions.  Using CSD due to its ver- 
satility and potential  application  to clinical  data ( Calamuneri  et al., 
2018 ; Toselli et al., 2017 ; Wilkins  et al., 2015 ) we extend earlier 
virtual dissection  protocols  based on DTI by providing  a descriptive  
summary  of the normal  WM anatomy  of 68 ﬁber bundles  recon- 
structed  using probabilistic  tractography.  We complement  our anatom-  
ical descriptions  with an open-source  group atlas in MNI space and 
automated  subject-speciﬁc  virtual dissection  software,  which we call 
“Fun with Tracts ” (FWT)  that incorporates  all the anatomical  inclu- 
sion and exclusion  labels per bundle.  As probabilistic  tractography  
produces  inherently  variable  results,  we also demonstrate  how this 
may vary within and between  individuals  using open-source  test-retest  
datasets  from the human connectome  project (HCP) ( Van Essen et al., 
2012 ) and the Multiple  acquisitions  for standardization  of structural  
imaging  validation  and evaluation  (MASSIVE)  dataset ( Froeling  et al., 
2017 ). The result is a detailed  and accessible  reference  for the vir- 
tual dissection  of normal  white matter anatomy  using CSD tractogra-  
phy.

2. Material  and methods  
2.1. Summary  
First, we describe  and present  an atlas of bundles  generated  with our 
literature-based  dissection  protocol  (FWT) for 68 WM fasciculi  based on 
the HCP-template  data using a bundle-speciﬁc  seeding  and tractography  
approach  described  in more detail below. Tractogram  images were gen- 
erated using MRView  ( Tournier  et al., 2019 ) and Surf-Ice  ( Rorden  and 
Hanayik,  2022 ). 
Second,  we assessed  inter-session/intra-subject  variability  by apply- 
ing the FWT whole-brain  tractography  and bundle segmentation  ap- 
proach to the individual  HCP test-retest  datasets  ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ) 
and conducted  similarity  analyses  between  the resulting  tractograms  
compared  to the HCP-template  bundles.  Resulting  weighted-dice  sim- 
ilarity coeﬃcient  (wDSC)  scores are shown in radar plots and were used 
to calculate  single-rater  agreement  intra-class  correlation  (ICC) scores to 
highlight  tractogram  variability  with respect to the template  bundles.  
Additionally,  we calculated  descriptive  statistics  and generated  violin 
plots for the wDSC scores resulting  from pairwise  comparisons  of the 
output from each session (i.e., HCP scan 1 versus HCP scan 2). This pro- 
vided a measure  of FWT reproducibility  within and between  subjects  
regardless  of similarity  to a model bundle.  HCP inter-subject  variabil-  
ity was evaluated  by generating  voxel-wise  heat-maps  of the summed  
binary masks of each bundle.  
Third, to test the variability  of FWT in an independent  dataset with 
diﬀerent  acquisition  parameters  and sampling  schemes,  we applied  it to 
the MASSIVE  dataset ( Froeling  et al., 2017 ). Model-based  wDSC bun- 
dle similarity  scores, using the HCP-template  bundles  as references,  
were then calculated  for every bundle from both the HCP and MASSIVE  
datasets.  We computed  wDSC descriptive  statistics  and generated  violin 
plots for evaluation.  This provided  a framework  for the comparison  of 
the outputs  from both datasets.  Finally,  we used single-rater  agreement  
ICC scores to evaluate  overall inter-session  agreement.  
2.2. Imaging  data 
2.2.1. HCP test ‐retest data 
The test-retest  HCP dataset ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ) 
(https://db.humanconnectome.org/data/projects/HCP_Retest)  consists  
of 2 scans acquired  at 1 - 11 months  apart using the same scanning  pro- 
tocol on the same 3-Tesla  Siemens  Skyra scanner  (Siemens  Healthineers,  
Erlangen,  Germany)  using a 32-channel  phased array receive  head coil. 
The HCP T1-weighted  images were acquired  using a 3D Magnetization  
Prepared  Rapid Acquisition  Gradient  Echo (MPRAGE)  pulse sequence  
with 0.7 mm isotropic  voxels. The diﬀusion  data was acquired  with 90 
directions  per shell with b- values (1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm 2 ), and 
1.25 mm isotropic  voxels. We used the preprocessed  ( Andersson  et al., 
2003a ; Andersson  and Sotiropoulos,  2016 , 2015 ; Glasser  et al., 2013 ; 
Jenkinson  et al., 2002 ) imaging  data of 20 random  subjects  (10 male / 
10 female)  resulting  in 40 scans (see supplementary  Table 1 for details).  
2.2.2. MASSIVE  data 
The MASSIVE  dataset ( Froeling  et al., 2017 ) ( http://www.massive-  
data.org  ), comprises  multiple  scans of the same healthy  individual  
(female,  25 years old) using various  b- values and diﬀusion  sampling  schemes.  Imaging  data was acquired  on a 3-Tesla  Philips Achieva  
scanner  (Philips  Healthcare,  Best, The Netherlands)  with an 8-channel  
phased array receive  head coil. MASSIVE  3D T1-weighted  images were 
acquired  with 1 mm isotropic  voxels, while dMRI images were acquired  
with 2.5 mm isotropic  voxels and multiple  shells with (0–9000  s/mm 2 ) 
b- values. We used the (0–4000  s/mm 2 ) b- shell data with the following  b- 
values in s/mm 2 and number  of diﬀusion-weighting  gradient  directions  
respectively  (b500 - 125, b1000 - 250, b2000 - 250, b3000 - 250, b4000 
– 300).  Five diﬀerent  sessions  were generated  using the preprocessed  
dMRI data acquired  with an anterior-posterior  (AP) phase-encoding  axis 
and a negative  gradient  polarity  to create 5 diﬀerent  sessions.  Two 
sessions  had multi-shell  and three had single shell data with varying  
b- values, numbers  of diﬀusion-weighted  volumes  and interleaved  b0 
volumes.  Additionally,  we used corresponding  reversed-phase  encoded  
b0 images for Echo-Planar  Imaging  (EPI) distortion  correction  in FSL 
( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ). We used the MASSIVE  data to investigate  FWT 
reproducibility  in the same subject with diﬀerent  b- values, number  of 
diﬀusion  directions  and b- shells Table 1 . lists the b- values and total num- 
ber of volumes  of all dMRI data used.

the ﬁeld of machine  learning  algorithms  for dementia,  such grand chal- 
lenges have been organized  to gain insight into successful  approaches  
and their potential  for use in clinical  practice  and clinical  trials ( Allen 
et al., 2016; Bron et al., 2015; Cash et al., 2015; Fisch et al., 2021; Mari- 
nescu et al., 2018; Sabuncu  and Konukoglu,  2015; Sarica et al., 2018 ). 
With the trend of grand challenges  in the ﬁeld of biomedical  image 
analysis  becoming  more important,  two frameworks  have been proposed  
in the literature  to evaluate  and structure  the design of grand challenges  
and assess the eﬀect of the design on the interpretation  and impact of 
challenge  results.  First, Maier-Hein  et al. (2018) performed  an evalu- 
ation of 150 challenges  and identiﬁed  major problems,  which led to 
best practice  advice. Regarding  challenge  design, they found that in the 
majority  of challenges  it was not possible  to reproduce  results,  to ade- 
quately  interpret  them, and compare  them across challenges,  since rel- 
evant information  was often missing  and since challenge  design (e.g. a 
choice of metrics  and methods  for rank computation)  was highly hetero- 
geneous.  In addition,  the authors  concluded  that the ranking  of an algo- 
rithm in a challenge  was not robust, but highly dependent  on a number  
of design choices  such as the test data sets used for validation,  the ob- 
servers who annotated  the data and the metrics  chosen for performance  
assessment,  as well as the methods  used for aggregating  values. Sec- 
ond, Mendrik  and Aylward  (2019) categorized  two types of challenges:  
challenges  that aim to generate  insight (insight  challenges)  and those 
that aim to solve a problem  (deployment  challenges).  The main purpose  
of this categorization  was to guide researchers  in setting-up  challenges  
of which the objectives  match with its design and conclusion.  Mixing 
the insight design with the deployment  design will negatively  impact 
the clinical  signiﬁcance  of the challenge  and generalizability  of meth- 
ods. While the ﬁrst framework  is based on a quantitative  approach  and 
the latter framework  provides  a mostly qualitative  view on grand chal- 
lenges, the identiﬁed  topics of importance  for evaluation  of challenge  
design and results largely overlap.  
In this review,  we will evaluate  the grand challenges  in de- 
mentia based on the topics deﬁned  by the frameworks  of Maier- 
Hein et al. (2018) and Mendrik  and Aylward  (2019) . Our main research  
question  is how the grand challenges  on this topic are strengthening  and 
complementing  each other. First, we will highlight  unanswered  clinical  
questions  in dementia  and the related tasks that are being addressed  
by machine  learning  algorithms.  Subsequently,  we will summarize  the 
included  grand challenges,  with an emphasis  on the role of neuroimag-  
ing. We will summarize  design choices,  including  the alignment  of their 
purpose  with the relevant  questions  in dementia,  the data and truth cri- 
teria, and performance  metrics.  In addition,  we will outline the results 
and assess their impact.  Finally,  we will reﬂect on the status of the ﬁeld 
and the open questions  that remain to be addressed  by future grand 
challenges.  
2. Questions  in clinical  and pre-clinical  dementia  
Worldwide  50 million  people are estimated  to be living with de- 
mentia and Alzheimer’s  disease  is the most prevalent  underlying  cause 
( Association,  2020 ). For Alzheimer’s  disease,  the pre-clinical  phase is 
found to take about 20 years before the onset of clinical  symptoms  
( Gordon  et al., 2018 ). Diagnosis  of dementia  is highly challenging  and 
usually  takes a substantial  period of time after the ﬁrst clinical  symp- 
toms arise ( Van Vliet et al., 2013 ). After diagnosis,  novel challenges  are 
related to prediction  and monitoring  of the disease,  both in the natural  
disease  course and under treatment  with potential  disease-modifying  
drugs in clinical  trials. Along diﬀerent  phases of dementia,  clinically  
relevant  questions  could be identiﬁed  to which machine  learning  meth- 
ods can contribute  by solving  related tasks exploiting  multi-parametric  
biomarkers.  
First, in the pre-clinical  stage, i.e. a community-dwelling  popula-  
tion without  cognitive  complaints,  a key question  is to identify  persons  
at-risk for developing  dementia  based on biomarker  measurements  at 
an individual  level. Several  approaches  for biomarker-based  screen-  ing have been proposed  ( Cole et al., 2017; Licher et al., 2019; Wang 
et al., 2019 ). Regarding  neuroimaging,  a frequently  studied  screening  
biomarker  is the brain age gap, i.e. the diﬀerence  between  chronological  
age and age predicted  from MRI using machine  learning,  which has been 
shown to identify  individuals  at risk for dementia  in the general  popula-  
tion ( Wang et al., 2019 ). While highly important  for improving  disease  
understanding,  there is currently  no clinical  motivation  for population  
screening.  As currently  no disease-modifying  medication  could be of- 
fered, the beneﬁt for individuals  at-risk to identify  them before symp- 
toms develop  may be very limited.  However,  while the ﬁrst Alzheimer’s  
disease  drug is entering  the market and while the search for disease-  
modifying  treatments  continues,  screening  of individuals  at a very early 
stage may aid inclusion  for clinical  trials ( Panegyres  et al., 2016 ). 
Second,  in an early-stage  clinical  population,  i.e. patients  with cog- 
nitive complaints  that visit a memory  clinic, the key question  is whether  
the person is developing  dementia.  The purpose  of clinical  status es- 
timation  is to understand  the current  ‘condition’  of the patient and to 
establish  a clinical  diagnosis  that enables  timely decision  making  regard-  
ing care and treatment  ( Prince et al., 2011 ). Relevant  components  of this 
clinical  status are whether  there is a cognitive  impairment  (e.g. quanti-  
ﬁed by a memory  score, or fulﬁlling  diagnostic  criteria  such as for mild 
cognitive  impairment  or dementia  ( Albert et al., 2011; McKhann  et al., 
2011 )) and what the underlying  cause of this cognitive  impairment  is 
(e.g. Alzheimer’s  disease).  
In addition  to current  clinical  status, in this early-stage  clinical  pop- 
ulation,  i.e. patients  with subjective  cognitive  decline  or a diagnosis  of 
mild cognitive  impairment,  a second key question  is whether  symptoms  
will develop  into dementia  and in what time frame. The purpose  of pre- 
diction  is to understand  the future ‘condition’  of the patient,  mainly to 
inform treatment  and care decisions,  but may also guide inclusion  of in- 
dividuals  at risk for dementia  in clinical  trials. Outcomes  of interest  for 
prediction  are for example  diagnosis  and clinical  functioning  at a future 
time point or time-to-conversion  to dementia.  
Lastly, in a later-stage  clinical  population,  after diagnosis  has been 
established,  a key question  involves  monitoring  the disease  develop-  
ment and, if applicable,  the patient’s  response  to treatment.  In follow-up  
consultations,  biomarkers  could be used to assess the disease  progres-  
sion in a quantitative  way.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5327, 5330), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(7679, 7683), match=' \n3.'>"

syndrome  ( J.H. Cole et al., 2017 ), major depressive  disorder  ( Han et al., 
2020 ), and diabetes  ( Franke et al., 2013 ). Brain age can also reliably  
predict cognitive  impairment  ( Liem et al., 2017 ; Boyle et al., 2021 ), fu- 
ture cognitive  decline  and dementia  ( Gaser et al., 2013 ), and mortality  
( Cole et al., 2018 ). Moreover,  brain age has been identiﬁed  as a bet- 
ter predictor  of cognitive  impairment  compared  to chronological  age 
( Habes et al., 2021 ). 
A number  of brain imaging  studies have also reported  that indi- 
viduals  who are overweight  or obese tend to have increased  brain 
age ( Kolenic  et al., 2018 ; Ronan et al., 2016 ), reﬂecting  poorer brain 
health likely due to grey and white matter atrophy  related to obesity  
( Zeighami  et al., 2021 ; Daoust et al., 2021 ; Michaud  et al., 2020 ; Garcia-  
Garcia et al., 2021 ). Interestingly,  grey matter reductions  associated  
with obesity  are consistent  with age-related  grey matter atrophy  pat- 
terns ( Franz et al., 2019 ), highlighting  the importance  of obesity  pre- 
vention  in promoting  healthy  ageing.  There is an increasing  number  of 
studies suggesting  that at least part of the structural  grey and white 
matter abnormalities  associated  with obesity  might be driven by ab- 
dominal  obesity-related  cardiometabolic  alterations,  such as inﬂamma-  
tion, insulin resistance,  dyslipidemia,  and hypertension  ( Morys et al., 
2021 ; Prats-Soteras  et al., 2020 ; Guillemot-Legris  and Muccioli,  2017 ; 
Moreno-Navarrete  et al., 2017 ). Intriguingly,  recent discoveries  from hu- 
man studies reported  that cardiometabolic  risk factors,  including  high 
blood pressure,  markers  of liver and kidney dysfunctions,  diabetes,  dys- 
lipidemia,  history of stroke, body mass index (BMI), and smoking  are 
associated  with an older-appearing  brain and accelerated  brain ageing 
( Beck et al., 2022 ; de Lange et al., 2020 ; Franke et al., 2014 ). 
It is unknown  whether  interventions  targeting  weight loss and car- 
diometabolic  improvement  can reduce brain age and improve  brain 
health. Bariatric  surgery  represents  an interesting  approach  to examine  
the impact of marked  weight loss and cardiometabolic  improvements  on 
brain health in a longitudinal  setting.  However,  studies linking bariatric  
surgery-induced  weight loss to reduced  brain age and improved  brain 
health are lacking.  Using our unique longitudinal  dataset following  in- 
dividuals  that went through  signiﬁcant  weight loss and cardiometabolic  
improvement  following  bariatric  surgery,  we investigated  this hypoth-  
esis. We investigated  the following  speciﬁc  hypotheses:  1) individuals  
with obesity  have higher brain age than individuals  with normal  weight,  
2) brain age decreases  4, 12, and 24 months  post-bariatric  surgery  (com- 
paring pre- and post-surgery),  and 3) the reduced  brain age following  
bariatric  surgery  is associated  with improvement  in cardiometabolic  risk 
factors.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Data 
Three distinct  datasets  were used to: 1) train the brain age pre- 
diction model, 2) investigate  whether  individuals  with obesity  have 
greater brain age than individuals  with normal  weight,  and 3) inves- 
tigate whether  weight loss as a result of bariatric  surgery  reverses  the 
eﬀect of obesity  and lowers the brain age. 
1) Training  dataset 
Data used to train the brain age prediction  model included  par- 
ticipants  with T1-weighted  MRI data available  from the second 
stage of the Cambridge  Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience  (Cam- 
CAN, https://www.cam-can.org/index.php?content  = dataset ) dataset,  
described  in Shafto et al. (2014) ( Shafto et al., 2014 ) and Taylor et al. 
(2017) ( Taylor et al., 2017 ). Participants  were screened  for neurologi-  
cal and psychiatric  conditions  and those with such underlying  disorders  
were excluded  from the study. In total, we have included  data from 640 
participants  (324 female),  with age range between  18 and 88 (and mean 
+ /- std of 54.2 + /- 18.6 yrs) and average  BMI of 25.8 + /- 4.6 kg/m 2 . 
T1-weighted  MRIs were acquired  on a 3T Siemens  TIM Trio, with a 
32-channel  head-coil  using a 3D magnetization-prepared  rapid gradient  
echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  (TR = 2250 ms, TE = 2.99 ms, TI = 900 ms, FA = 9 deg, ﬁeld of view (FOV) = 256 ×240 ×192 mm, 1 mm 3 
isotropic,  GRAPPA  = 2, TA = 4 min 32 s). For detailed  acquisition  param- 
eters see: https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/pdfs/  
CAMCAN700_MR_params.pdf  . 
2) Independent  dataset to compare  brain age between  individuals  
with obesity  and individuals  with normal  weight 
Data used to assess the predicted  brain age diﬀerence  between  in- 
dividuals  with obesity  and those with normal  weight included  an inde- 
pendent  sample from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) ( Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2012 ). All the participants  from the 
HCP with a BMI higher than 35 kg/m 2 were included  in this sample.  
These participants  (n = 46) were individually  matched  (1:1) for age, 
sex, and ethnicity  with a group of HCP individuals  who had a normal  
body weight (n = 46). Other exclusion  criteria  included  participants  with 
missing  information  on age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity.  T1-weighted  3D 
MPRAGE  sequence  with 0.7 mm ( Nadig et al., 2021 ) isotropic  resolution  
images were acquired  by the HCP investigators  using a 3T MRI scanner  
(Siemens  Skyra) equipped  with a 32-channel  head coil. The following  
parameters  were used: 256 sagittal  slices in a single slab, TR = 2400 ms, 
TE = 2.14 ms, FA = 8 deg, FOV = 224 mm, T1 = 1000 ms, Echo Spac- 
ing = 7.6 ms, voxel size = 0.7 ×0.7 ×0.7 mm ( Nadig et al., 2021 ) 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). 
3) Bariatric  surgery-induced  weight loss assessment  dataset  
Data used for the main analyses  included  participants  with severe 
obesity  (mean age at baseline  = 44.0 ± 9.2 yrs; mean BMI at base- 
line = 4",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5312, 5315), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(6327, 6329), match='3.'>"

who were still responding  kept exhibiting  a P300, a brain response  as- 
sociated  with predictive  coding and consciousness  ( Bekinschtein  et al., 
2009 ; Dehaene  and Changeux,  2011 ; Wacongne  et al., 2011 ), while 
those who were not responding  did not exhibit any P300. There were 
then clear-cut  diﬀerences  in behavioural  and brain responses  to exter- 
nal stimulations  within this same stage of N1 sleep, raising the question  
of the real electrophysiological  markers  of sleep onset. Improving  our 
knowledge  of those markers  seems critical in order to properly  assess 
vigilance  and related cognitive  and behavioural  states, whether  it be in 
the ﬁelds of medicine,  research  or public health, such as in the evalua-  
tion of drowsiness  while driving  or operating  machinery.  
Such a fuzziness  in behavioural  and brain responses  observed  in N1 
sleep is largely favoured  by the large time window  used for sleep scor- 
ing (typically  30 sec.), which necessarily  leads to the averaging  of mul- 
tiple brain activities,  and implies  that what is called N1 sleep (and pre- 
ceding wakefulness)  is likely to include  periods  of wakefulness,  drowsi-  
ness and sleep. Indeed,  N1 sleep may regroup  within the same 30 sec. 
epoch alpha rhythms,  alpha suppression  with a ﬂattening  of the sig- 
nal, theta rhythms,  and grapho-elements  such as vertex sharp waves 
or incomplete  sleep spindles.  The presence  of those diﬀerent  electro-  
encephalographic  (EEG) patterns  before entering  N2 sleep, when occur 
the ﬁrst sleep spindle  or K-Complex,  has already  been described  a few decades  ago (Gibbs and Gibbs, 1950 ; Hori, 1991 ; Santamaria  and Chi- 
appa, 1987 ). Hori and colleagues  ( Hori, 1991 ; Hori et al., 1994 ) devel- 
oped a 5 seconds-epoch  classiﬁcation  of drowsiness  based on the diﬀer- 
ent EEG patterns  ( ﬁgure 1. B), enabling  to better reﬂect the rapid rhythm  
modiﬁcations  that occur during the wake-sleep  transition.  They showed  
that both hypnagogic  perceptions  and reaction  times evolved  in correla-  
tion with these successive  EEG modiﬁcations.  More recently,  alpha sup- 
pression  and the occurrence  of theta rhythms  have been associated  with 
decreased  brain connectivity  ( Noreika  et al., 2020 ) and modiﬁcations  
in conscious  threshold  ( Noreika  et al., 2017 ), and the theta-alpha  ratio 
was shown to discriminate  non-responsive  periods  in deep drowsiness  
from responsive  wakefulness  ( Comsa et al., 2018 ). 
We then propose  here to go further in the deﬁnition  of sleep onset, in 
specifying  the time-course  of responsiveness  fading in association  with 
physiological  markers,  and trying to extract the physiological  predic- 
tors of responsiveness  at each given time. We re-analysed  the wake-sleep  
transition  of our above-mentioned  study ( Strauss et al., 2015 ) taking ad- 
vantage  of the detailed  Hori classiﬁcation  ( Hori et al., 1994 ) and its sim- 
pliﬁed version  ( Nittono  et al., 2001 ) ( ﬁgure 1. B), and extracted  related 
markers  of ongoing  activity  reﬂecting  information  and connectivity  in 
the brain ( Denis A. Engemann  et al., 2018 ; Sitt et al., 2014 ) and event- 
related responses  (ERFs) to stimuli.  We used machine  learning  methods  
to extract the predictors  of responsiveness.  We demonstrate  here the ex- 
istence of a period of drowsiness  distinct  from wakefulness  and sleep, 
characterized  by transient  brain states that come on and oﬀat the scale 
of a few seconds  and where brain activity  and long-distance  communi-  
cation in speciﬁc  frequency  bands, especially  the alpha band, are the 
best predictors  of responsiveness.  
2. Materials  and Methods  
2.1. Procedure  
The current  paper is a reanalysis  of data described  in Strauss 
et al. (2015) . Subjects  were recorded  in magneto-  and electro-  
encephalography  (M/EEG)  in wakefulness  and sleep during a morning  
nap, after a night of sleep restriction  (4h of sleep, controlled  by actime-  
try - Actiwatch  7, Sleepwatch  software  7.5 CamNtech).  
2.2. Stimulation  
Stimuli  were pairs (AB) of phonetically  distant French vowels (100 
ms duration).  Each pair was used to form 2 types of blocks with 100 se- 
quences  of 5 vowels (150ms  stimulus  onset asynchrony  (SOA) between  
vowels).  Sequences  were separated  by silent gaps of variable  duration  
(700 to 1000ms  inter-trial  interval  (ITI), 50ms steps) . In one block type 
(aa), the 5 vowels within the sequence  were identical  (aaaaa,  ‘local stan- 
dard’ sequence,  LS) in the 10 ﬁrst sequences  of habituation  and then in 
80% of the sequences  of the block, deﬁning  then the ‘global standard’  
(GS) sequence  (cf ﬁgure 1. B). In the 20% remaining  sequences  (‘global  
deviants’,  GD), the 5 th vowel diﬀered  from the 4 ﬁrst ones (aaaa B , ‘local 
deviant’,  LD). In the other block type (a B ), reversely  ‘local deviant’  se- 
quences  were used as ‘global standards’,  and ‘local standards’  sequences  
as ‘global deviants’.  The global eﬀect was then computed  contrasting  
the global deviant  sequences  to the global standard  ones, and the lo- 
cal eﬀect contrasting  the local deviant  sequences  to the local standard  
ones. Each type of blocks was repeated  twice in order to counterbalance  
vowels.  
Auditory  sequences  were presented  during sleep and during wake- 
fulness before and after the nap. To monitor  responsiveness  to the envi- 
ronment,  subjects  were asked to give a motor response  whenever  they 
heard a global deviant  (in pressing  a button,  hand was balanced  across 
subjects),  and to try to continue  responding  even as they were falling 
asleep during the sleep session.  As we asked subjects  to respond  as soon 
as they were aware of deviant  sounds,  responsiveness  and consciousness  
were confounded  in this study. We conﬁrmed  this association  in showing  
2  M. Strauss, J.D. Sitt, L. Naccache  et al. NeuroImage  251 (2022) 119003 
that the M/EEG  global eﬀect (P300) was not present  in non-responsive  
trials (cf ﬁgure 3 .). Importantly,  we controlled  in a previous  publication  
( Strauss et al., 2015 ) that the presence  of the P300 was associated  with 
conscious  detection  and not only with motor responses  by asking sub- 
jects not to respond  but to be attentive  to GD sequences  in half of the 
blocks during wakefulness.  We conﬁrmed  that a P300 was still elicited  
after global deviant  sequences  in those no-report  but attentive  blocks.

the glymphatic  and lymphatic  clearance  pathways  through  exchange  of 
the subarachnoid  CSF with ISF and excretion  of waste products  from the 
cranium  via the mLVs to the subarachnoid  CSF ( Louveau  et al. 2017 ). 
Conventionally,  phase contrast  (PC) MRI has been used to study 
pulsatile  CSF functionality  ( Battal et al. 2011 ; Tuura et al. 2021 ). PC 
MRI uses a pair of bipolar  gradients  to visualize  moving  ﬂuids, quan- 
tify their velocity,  and provide  velocity  records  during a single cardiac  
phase in combination  with cine-gating.  PC MRI enables  quantiﬁcation  
of CSF pulsation  in an absolute  unit which is useful as a biomarker  for 
clinical  diagnosis  and prognosis  ( Krauss et al., 1997 ; Bradley,  2002 ; Al- 
Zain et al., 2007 ). Speciﬁcally,  Tarumi  et al. quantiﬁed  cerebral  blood 
ﬂow (CBF) and CSF pulsation  dynamics  during repeated  handgrip  exer- 
cises using cine-gated  PC MRI ( Tarumi  et al. 2021 ). However,  PC MRI 
is not suitable  for obtaining  dynamic  functional  changes  because  of its 
long scan time. Recently,  another  CSF studies using echo-planar  imag- 
ing (EPI) based functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) received  
much attention  ( Fultz et al. 2019 ; Han et al. 2021 ; Yang et al. 2022 ). 
EPI-based  CSF measurement  is advantageous  over PC MRI for dynamic  
acquisition,  enabling  us to measure  both CSF and blood oxygenation  
level dependent  (BOLD)  signals simultaneously  and dynamically.  How- 
ever, unlike PC MRI, the previous  fMRI-based  methods  for studying  CSF 
pulsation,  which are based on the measurement  in the edge slices (CS- 
Fedge),  lack quantitative  metrics  of CSF ﬂow itself. Fultz et al. used the 
CSF inﬂow eﬀect on the edge slices of the EPI scans to reveal a coherent  
pattern  between  CSF signals in the 4 th ventricle  and electrophysiologi-  
cal hemodynamic  signals and to demonstrate  that the inﬂow eﬀect was 
reinforced  during sleep ( Fultz et al. 2019 ). Furthermore,  Han et al. also 
used EPI fMRI data to simultaneously  measure  CSF inﬂow and brain ac- 
tivity ( Han et al. 2021 ). They demonstrated  a correlation  between  the 
global brain activity  and CSF inﬂow and that the correlation  was related 
to the pathology  of Alzheimer’s  disease  ( Han et al. 2021 ). Lastly, Yang 
and his colleagues  found that a delayed  CSF inﬂow signal correlated  
with brain hemodynamic  signals during awake states, mainly in terms 
of low frequency  CSF oscillation  ( Yang et al. 2022 ). 
Both PC MRI and EPI-based  fMRI are necessary  to quantitatively  and 
dynamically  study functional  CSF pulsation  in multiple  subjects.  There- 
fore, we aimed to develop  a novel method  to dynamically  quantify  a 
CSF pulsation  metric based on inter-slice  saturation  eﬀects ( Park and 
Duong,  2011 ; Han et al., 2015 ; Kim et al., 2016 ) of CSF directly  from 
EPI-based  fMRI data (CSFpulse).  We hypothesized  that our method  can 
demonstrate  inter-subject/intra-subject  CSF pulsation  variability  more 
reliably  and quantitatively.  The proposed  technique  was quantitatively  
compared  to cine-gated  PC MRI and the previous  EPI-based  method  (CS- 
Fedge) using resting state and typical task-based  fMRI.

puting the temporal  derivative  of the phase angle time series obtained  
after Hilbert-transforming  a narrowband-ﬁltered  signal. 
Frequency  sliding has been used in a number  of experiments  to 
demonstrate  temporal  ﬂuctuations  in oscillatory  frequency  in response  
to varying  stimulus  properties  ( Cohen, 2014 ; Gulbinaite  et al., 2019 ; 
Noguchi  and Kubo, 2020 ), task demands  ( Wutz et al., 2018 ), as a 
predictor  of trial-to-trial  variability  in perception  ( Nelli et al., 2017 ; 
Samaha  and Postle, 2015 ; Shen et al., 2019 ), and as a method  for com- 
puting functional  connectivity  between  brain areas ( Cohen, 2014 ). De- 
spite use in the ﬁeld, the method  has not been extensively  tested in 
the recovery  of ground-truth  oscillatory  frequency.  Initial simulations  
were presented  in the paper that introduced  the method  in the con- 
text of electrophysiology  data ( Cohen, 2014 ), which revealed  that the 
use of a band-pass  ﬁlter with a plateau  shape in the frequency  do- 
main (the ﬁrst step of the frequency  sliding analysis;  see methods)  did 
not bias the estimated  frequency  towards  the center of the ﬁlter band 
(as, presumably,  a ﬁlter with a Gaussian  response  in the frequency  do- 
main would).  Howespectrum-based  methods  assume  that the dominant  
frequency  of a sub-band  is approximately  stationver,  frequency  slid- 
ing has not been evaluated  in the context  of changing  physiologically-  
relevant  parameters  of the power spectrum.  In particular,  it has recently  
been noted how the exponent  (i.e., slope) of the 1/ f x component  of 
the signal power spectrum  (also referred  to as the aperiodic  compo-  
nent) can, if not accounted  for, confound  measurements  such as oscilla- 
tory power or band-power  ratios ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 , 2020 ). More- 
over, aperiodic  slope has been found to vary considerably  both within-  
( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ; Podvalny  et al., 2015 ) and between-individuals  
( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ; Voytek et al., 2015 ), particularly  across devel- 
opment  ( Schaworonkow  and Voytek,  2020 ). Because  oscillatory  activity  
is embedded  within such aperiodic  activity,  an investigation  of whether  
aperiodic  exponent  variation  impacts  estimation  via frequency  sliding 
is warranted.  
To preview,  the attempt  to recover  simulated  oscillatory  frequency  
revealed  a systematic  underestimation  of the true oscillation  frequency,  
the magnitude  of which depended  on the slope of the power spectrum  
and the amplitude  of the oscillation.  Thus, keeping  oscillatory  frequency  
constant  and varying  aperiodic  slope or oscillation  amplitude  could 
manifest  in changes  to the instantaneous  frequency  estimated  via fre- 
quency  sliding,  producing  a possible  confound  in real data. Although  fre- 
quency  sliding is a valuable  tool for uncovering  time-varying  frequency  
modulations  in electrophysiological  data, users of the method  should be 
aware of these alternative  causes of estimated  frequency  modulation  in 
their data. We discuss several possible  mitigating  strategies.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Simulated  data 
Signals were simulated  in the MATLAB  environment  (2020a,  version  
9.8.0) with use of the MATLAB  DSP System Toolbox.  The code and simu- 
lated signals are freely provided  at https://osf.io/f8jqd/  . Simulated  sig- 
nals comprised  a periodic  (sinewave)  and an aperiodic  (1/ f ) component,  
which were ﬁrst independently  generated  and then summed.  Details of 
each signal component  are described  below. 
The aperiodic  component  of the power spectrum  was simulated  us- 
ing the dsp.ColoredNoise  MATLAB  object, which generates  random  val- 
ues that follow a 1/ f x power spectrum,  with the exponent,  x , as a con- 
trollable  parameter.  Signals were simulated  with 8 diﬀerent  exponents  
ranging  linearly  from 0.1 to 2 (ﬂatter to steeply negative).  Note that 
the exponent  corresponds  to the slope of a straight  line ﬁt to the ape- 
riodic power spectrum  in log-log coordinates  multiplied  by − 1. The 
range of exponents  simulated  here was chosen to encompass  the dis- 
tribution  of actual exponents  measured  during resting-state  in a large 
sample of adults ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ), which has a mean of 0.83, 
but which can vary considerably  across the ﬁrst months  of develop-  
ment ( Schaworonkow  and Voytek,  2020 ). Lastly, the aperiodic  signal was mean-centered  and scaled by a factor of 9 to bring it within range 
of typical single-trial  EEG data (approx.  − 40 to 40 microvolts  when 
x = 0.91). Example  single-trial  signals are shown in Fig. 1 A. With these 
parameters,  the “rotation  point ”in the power spectrum  –that is, the fre- 
quency  about which the spectrum  pivots –is around 45 Hz (see Fig. 2 ). 
In intracranial  recordings,  the rotation  point was found to vary widely 
across brain areas, but has a modal value around 30 Hz in visual ar- 
eas, 40 Hz in auditory  areas, and 60 Hz in motor areas ( Podvalny  et al., 
2015 ). Thus, the aperiodic  activity  simulated  here has many features  in 
common  with empirical  electrophysiological  spectra.  
Sine waves (i.e., oscillations  or the periodic  component)  were gen- 
erated and summed  with the aperiodic  signal. Sine waves were deﬁned  
with a mean frequency  of 10 Hz and trial-to-trial  standard  deviation  
(SD) of 1 Hz in order to approximate  the typical bandwidth  of alpha 
activity  in real data ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ; Haegens  et al., 2014 ). The 
choice to model the human alpha oscillation  is motivated  by the fact that 
frequency  sliding has been applied  particularly  often to the study of al- 
pha frequency  ( Cohen, 2014 ; Gulbinaite  et al., 2017 ; Nelli et al., 2017 ; 
Samaha  and Postle, 2015 ; Shen et al., 2019 ; Wutz et al., 2018 ). Oscil- 
lation amplitude  varied across 8 levels, linearly  spaced between  0.1 to 
15 (small to large). This range approximates  the range of peak-to-peak  
amplitudes  of single-trial  alpha oscillations  observed  in EEG, measured  
in microvolts.  The phase of the sinewave  varied randomly  from trial to 
trial between  -pi and pi, to mimic spontaneous  (i.e., non-phase-locked)  
activity.  
In total 10,000 trials were simulated  (corresponding  to simulated  
500 trials for each of 20 subjects)  at each of the 8 exponent  levels and 
8 amplitude  levels, for a total of 640,000  simulated  trials. Simulating  
fewer trials increases  the variability  of the estimated  frequencies,  but 
does not change the general  pattern  of results (not shown).  Each trial 
was 3 s long, with a sampling  rate of 256 Hz. To avoid ﬁlter-related  edge 
artifacts  in plots and averages,  only the central second of each trial (i.e., 
1–2 s) was extracted  following  the frequency  sliding analysis.  Power 
spectra  were constructed  by applying  a fast Fourier  transform  ( ﬀt.m ) to 
the detrended,  Hamming-tapered,  data from each 3 second epoch. The 
absolute  value of the resulting  Fourier  coeﬃcients  were squared  and 
log 10 transformed  (on single trials; see ( Smulders  et al., 2018 ) to obtain 
power in the frequency  domain.  We computed  the signal-to-noise  ratio 
(SNR) of alpha activity  on each simulated  trial by dividing  the power 
at 10 Hz by the average  power at neighboring  frequencies  6 and 14 Hz 
(note that this was done prior to log10 transformation  so that the re- 
sulting ratio was more interpretable).  These values were then averaged  
across trials in each simulation  condition.  Thus, an SNR of 1 means that 
there was just as much signal at 10 Hz as there was at nearby frequencies  
(i.e., there is no alpha peak in the single-trial  spectrum).  ”
2.2. Frequency  sliding 
Instantaneous  frequency  was estimated  following  the frequency  slid- 
ing method  described  in ( Cohen, 2014 ). Brieﬂy,  the simulated  signals 
(comprising  the sum of the periodic  and aperiodic  component)  were nar- 
rowband  ﬁltered  between  8 and 12 Hz using a FIR ( ﬁrls.m ) ﬁlter with 
a plateau-shaped  frequency  response  in order to prevent  biasing  the ﬁl- 
tered data towards  the center of the band. The ﬁlter had a transition  
width of 15% of the lower and upper frequency  bounds  and was applied  
in the forward  and reverse  direction  ( ﬁltﬁlt.m  ) to achieve  a zero-phase  
ﬁlter. A Hilbert transform  ( hilbert.m  ) was applied  to the narrowband  
ﬁltered  data and the phase angle time series was extracted  ( angle.m  ). 
Lastly, the phases were unwrapped  ( unwrap.m  ), and the ﬁrst temporal  
derivative  was computed  ( diﬀ.m ). When scaled by the sampling  rate and 
2 𝜋, the temporal  derivative  of the phase angle time series estimates  the 
instantaneous  frequency  in the ﬁltered  band (see Fig. 1 B). 
To avoid phase slips or other sudden  transitions  in the phase time 
series from causing  large spikes in the instantaneous  frequency  estimate,  
the scaled derivative  was ﬁltered  10 times with median  ﬁlters spanning  
10 to 400 ms. The median  ﬁlter step is less critical in the simulated  data,

Fig. 1. Simulation/recovery  method and the underestimation  of instantaneous  oscillation  frequency  in real data. A ) Simulated  signals contained  an aperiodic  1/f x 
component  with a variable  exponent  and a periodic  (sine wave) component  with a ﬁxed frequency  of 10 Hz but a variable  amplitude.  The top panel shows an 
example  trial with a relatively  low exponent  (shallow  slope) and low amplitude.  The bottom panel shows an example  trial with a relatively  high exponent  (steep

spectra on the right are averaged  over 10,000 simulated  trials and show the eﬀect of varying parameters  in the timeseries.  B ) Frequency  sliding ( Cohen, 2014 ) can 
be used to recover instantaneous  ﬂuctuations  in oscillatory  frequency.  Here, the logic is shown for a cosine signal increasing  linearly in frequency  from 2 to 20 Hz 
over the course of 3 s (a “chirp ”). Once the band of interest in the signal has been isolated (typically  via ﬁltering),  the phase angle is extracted  via Hilbert transform  
(second panel), and its temporal  derivative  is computed  and scaled to Hz (last panel). In this example,  frequency  sliding accurately  captures  the temporal  changes  in 
frequency.  C ) Peak frequency  estimated  via FFT of real EEG data recoded  from the ﬁrst author’s  scalp (electrode  POz) averaged  over trials of a dot-motion  direction  
discrimination  task ( n = 973; 0–800 ms post-stimulus).  The log-log spectrum  shows a strong negative  slope (gray dashed line; exponent  approx. ∼1.45, cf. spectrum  
in panel A) obtained  via robust linear ﬁt. The peak alpha frequency  is at 10.47 Hz. Notice how, because of the 1/f slope, the lower edge of the alpha band (8 Hz) has 
greater power than the upper edge of the band (12 Hz), indicated  with circles and arrows. D ) Frequency  sliding results of these data show a clear underestimation  
of the peak frequency  obtained  via FFT (black dashed line). The gray window  spans timepoints  used for the FFT in panel C; shaded bands denote ± 1 SEM across 
trials; inset below denotes timing of the dot-motion  stimulus.  
but was included  to keep the analysis  close to the protocol  for real data, 
where non-physiological  artifacts  need to be attenuated  via this median  
ﬁltering  protocol  ( Cohen, 2014 ; Gulbinaite  et al., 2017 ; Samaha  and 
Postle, 2015 ; Wutz et al., 2018 ). 
A ﬁlter range of 8 to 12 Hz was chosen as it is centered  on the sim- 
ulated oscillation  of 10 Hz, encompasses  the full alpha peak (given the 
SD of the simulated  peaks), and is a commonly  used deﬁnition  of the 
alpha-band.  Diﬀerent  ﬁlter ranges were explored,  but unless otherwise  
stated, the default was 8 to 12 Hz. In plots, the 95% conﬁdence  interval  
(CI) on outcome  measures  are presented  in order to give a sense of the 
variability  across the simulations  rather than to infer any statistical  sig- 
niﬁcance  given that the CI could be arbitrarily  scaled by changing  the 
number  of simulated  trials. 2.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5514, 5517), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(12648, 12650), match='3.'>"

Conclusions:  We progressively  improved  our recording  setup and are now able to record (i) microelectrode  signals 
with low noise level up to 3 weeks duration,  and (ii) MUA from an increased  number of wires . We built a step 
by step procedure  from electrode  trajectory  planning  to recordings.  All these delicate steps are essential  for 
continuous  long-term  recording  of units in order to advance  in our understanding  of both the pathophysiology  
of ictogenesis  and the neuronal  coding of cognitive  and physiological  functions.  
1. Introduction  
Intracranial  electroencephalography  (iEEG) investigation  prior to 
epilepsy  surgery  represents  a rare opportunity  to access human neu- 
ronal assemblies  function  in vivo for extended  periods  of time. A surgical  
implantation  of intracerebral  electrodes  can delineate  the epileptogenic  
focus, called the seizure onset zone (SOZ), when non-invasive  electroen-  
cephalography  (EEG) and neuroimaging  have been insuﬃcient  to local- 
ize the epileptogenic  focus in drug-resistant  patients  ( Crandall  et al., 
1963 ; Engel et al., 2005 ; Reif et al., 2016 ; Zijlmans  et al., 2019 ). 
Diﬀerent  types of electrodes  can be surgically  implanted,  alone or in 
combination:  subdural  strip electrodes,  grid electrodes,  or depth elec- 
trodes for stereoelectroencephalography  (sEEG).  All of these electrodes  
contain  several macrocontacts  , spaced several millimeters  to centimeters  
apart. Each macrocontact  has a size of a few mm and measures  neu- 
ronal activity  from a large population  of neurons  ( Buzsáki  et al., 2012 ; 
Parvizi and Kastner,  2018 ). 
Microelectrodes  have small contact  areas at the tip of isolated  wires, 
with a diameter  of around 40 μm. Compared  to macrocontacts,  mi- 
crowires  provide  two main advantages:  an increased  spatial resolution,  
allowing  the recording  of local ﬁeld potentials  (LFPs) at submillime-  
ter scale from small neuronal  assemblies;  and the ability to record 
action potentials  of sampled  neurons,  i.e.multi-unit  activities  (MUAs)  
from which single-unit  activities  (SUAs) can be isolated  after spike sort- 
ing ( Pedreira  et al., 2012 ; Stacey et al., 2013 ). The ﬁrst acute record-  
ings of units in the human mesial temporal  lobe were made in 1971, 
during and between  seizures  ( Verzeano  et al., 1971 ). Macroelectrodes  
have been modiﬁed  to allow the insertion  of a ﬂexible  bundle of mi- 
crowires  ( Babb et al., 1973 ). Subsequently,  microelectrodes  have been 
inserted  for the duration  of the iEEG in the epileptogenic  focus in hu- 
mans ( Babb and Crandall,  1976 ; Wyler et al., 1982 ) and diﬀerent  micro- 
electrode  types have been developed.  Hybrid depth electrodes  have mi- 
crocontacts  interspaced  between  macrocontacts  ( Howard  et al., 1996 ). 
In the Ad-Tech  Behnke-Fried  macro-microelectrodes  model ( Fried et al., 
1997 ), microwires  are inserted  through  the macroelectrode  shaft, pro- 
truding  into the cerebral  tissue beyond  the tip of the depth macro- 
electrode.  In the DIXI hybrid macro-microelectrodes  model, the mi- 
crowires  exit the macroelectrode  shaft between  macrocontacts  and 
have a tetrode  rather than a single-wire  conﬁguration  ( Despouy  et al., 
2019 ). The Utah array is a two dimensional  array of 4 mm ×4 mm 
that contains  96 microelectrodes  and can be implanted  at the surface 
of the cortex ( Schevon  et al., 2008 ). Lastly, high density  poly(3,4-  
ethylenedioxythiophene)  polystyrene  sulfonate  (PEDOT:PSS)  microelec-  
trodes were recently  proposed,  for acute recordings  in the operative  
room during surgery  ( Paulk et al., 2021 ). 
Microelectrodes  are implanted  in patients  with epilepsy  for research  
purposes  and the analysis  of the LFP, MUA or SUA recorded  have pro- 
vided valuable  insights  into neuronal  codes or underlying  physiological  
processes,  as well as cognition  ( Axelrod  et al., 2019 ; Ekstrom  et al., 
2003 ; Fried et al., 1997 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; Kreiman  et al., 2000 ; 
Lakretz  et al., 2021 ; Mormann  et al., 2008 ; Quiroga  et al., 2005 ). Record-  
ings allow testing of cognitive  processes  such as working  and episodic  
memory,  with temporal  precision  through  single-trial  studies in brain 
areas without  epileptic  activities.  For example,  important  ﬁndings  were 
obtained  in the mesial temporal  lobe, in the amygdala  and hippocampus  
with Behnke-Fried  electrodes  ( Fried et al., 1997 ), where the isolation  
of SUA was essential  to describe  individual  neurons’  behaviors.  Itzak 
Fried’s group described  category  speciﬁc  SUA, such as imagery  neurons  in the human mesial temporal  lobe ( Kreiman  et al., 2000 ) and place 
cells in the human hippocampus  ( Ekstrom  et al., 2003 ). Some mesial 
temporal  lobe SUAs could be selectively  activated  by distinct  pictures  of 
given objects,  landmarks  or individuals,  such as “Jennifer  Aniston  neu- 
ron ”( Quiroga  et al., 2005 ). Long-term  recordings  (up to 3 weeks) dur- 
ing presurgical  implantation  allow dedicated  time periods  for cognitive  
tasks, which can be repeated  over several days and weeks. This has obvi- 
ous value for studying  memory  encoding  and retrieval  ( Kornblith  et al., 
2017 ; Rutishauser  et al., 2021 ; Staresina  et al., 2019 ). 
Microelectrode  recordings  have also been a major tool for investigat-  
ing the pathophysiology  of epilepsy,  notably  the ictogenesis,  i.e. how the 
brain initiates  seizures.  Epileptic  seizures  on EEG are the main electro-  
physiological  marker  of epilepsy.  Recognizing  the most precocious  and 
faster components  of the ictal discharge  is a key step in identifying  the 
SOZ ( Fisher et al., 1992 ; Talairach  and Bancaud,  1966 ; Wendling  et al., 
2003 ). Microelectrodes  inserted  in the SOZ can capture  single-unit  ac- 
tivities at the beginning  and the development  of seizures  and help to de- 
scribe SOZ networks  ( Lambrecq  et al., 2017 ; Schevon  et al., 2012 , 2008 ). 
In addition,  according  to the waveform  and ﬁring properties  of isolated  
neurons  through  spike sorting,  it is possible  to distinguish  putative  pyra- 
midal cells and interneurons,  and to describe  their respective  involve-  
ment in the generation  of seizures  ( Elahian  et al., 2018 ; Truccolo  et al., 
2011 ; Weiss et al., 2016 ). Microelectrodes  have also been used to de- 
scribe single unit behaviors  during interictal  events like epileptic  spikes 
and have shown heterogeneous  ﬁring patterns  ( Alvarado-Rojas  et al., 
2013 ; Despouy  et al., 2019 ; Keller et al., 2010 ; Ulbert et al., 2004 ). 
Microelectrodes  can also detect other epileptic  markers  that are not de- 
tected on adjacent  macroelectrodes,  such as high frequency  oscillations  
(HFOs),  speciﬁcally  in the fast ripple band (250-500  Hz). Initially  iden- 
tiﬁed from microelectrode  recordings,  HFOs were assumed  to be gener- 
ated by small neuronal  assemblies  of about one mm 3 ( Zijlmans  et al., 
2017 ). Microelectrodes  have also revealed  microseizures  as discrete  
rhythmic  activities  that would not be detected  by macroelectrodes,  due 
to the better resolution  of microelectrodes  for sampling  the local ﬁeld 
potentials  of much smaller  neuronal  assemblies  ( Schevon  et al., 2008 ; 
Staba et al., 2014 ; Stead et al., 2010 ). 
Detection  of units on microelectrodes  signal requires  a high signal to 
noise ratio (SNR), that depends  on the noise level in the signal but also 
on the distance  of the electrode  from the soma of the neuron ( Rey et al., 
2015 ; Buzsáki  et al., 2012 ). The higher the noise level is, the more dif- 
ﬁcult it is to detect action potentials  of lower amplitude.  The accuracy  
of the spike sorting algorithm  to assign the action potentials  detected  
to diﬀerent  neurons  will also be aﬀected  by a high noise level because  
of an alteration  of the action potential  waveforms  ( Buccino  et al., 2020 ; 
Chaure  et al., 2018 ; Wild et al., 2012 ). As for all electrophysiological  
recordings,  electro-magnetic  noise from the surrounding  environment,  
as well as movement  artifacts  are major noise sources  for the signal. 
Therefore,  and because  it is not possible  to move the microwire  of the 
Behnke-Fried  electrode  to approach  the soma of a neuron,  it is crucial 
to decrease  those noise sources,  especially  because  microwires  have a 
very small diameter,  that makes them very fragile and sensitive  to noise 
( Misra et al., 2014 ). 
Furthermore,  epileptic  events, in particular  seizures,  have unpre- 
dictable  occurrences  and require  continuous  and long-term  electrophys-  
iological  monitoring  to be recorded.  Studying  LFPs and unit activity  dur- 
ing those events is only possible  with stable high quality microelectrode  
recordings  during the whole monitoring  period. Long-term  microelec-  
trode recordings  are also essential  for physiological  and cognitive  stud-

ies at the cellular  level. However,  continuous  and long-term  recordings  
with microelectrodes  are technically  highly challenging.  Thanks  to a 
strong collaboration  between  several clinical  teams of Pitié-Salpêtrière  
Hospital  (Paris, France)  and a research  center (Paris Brain Institute),  lo- 
cated on the hospital’s  site, we started to record epileptic  patients  with 
Behnke-Fried  microelectrodes  in 2010. 
The aim of this paper is to share our experience  of the last 10-year  
with continuous  long-term  microelectrode  recordings  and bring recom- 
mendations  complementary  to already  published  methodological  pa- 
pers. Electrode  manipulation  during the surgery  is a crucial step to avoid 
noise resulting  from wire degradation  and has been described  in several 
papers ( Misra et al., 2014 ; Minxha  et al., 2018 ). Detailed  quantiﬁca-  
tion of noise level depending  on technical  setting is important  as well to 
adopt the best methodology,  but has not been quantiﬁed  and described  
in detail from our knowledge.  We have described  the technical  issues we 
faced, and the diﬀerent  improvements  we made to reduce the noise level 
on the signal, which is crucial to increase  the possibilities  to record MUA 
and SUA. We have ﬁrst described  our current  recording  methodology  in 
the Method  section.  The improvement  of our data quality over time is 
reported  in the Results section with detailed  noise level measures  and a 
quantiﬁcation  of multi-units  recordings  depending  on diﬀerent  material  
setups. In addition,  we have summarized  the main technical  guidelines,  
from surgery  to recordings,  that we found essential  to improve  the qual- 
ity of microelectrode  recordings.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Patients  
Since 2010, ﬁfty-six  patients  with refractory  focal epilepsy  under- 
went a presurgical  intracerebral  electrode  investigation  with additional  
microelectrodes.  The aim of the clinical  intracerebral  investigation  was 
to determine  the SOZ when non-invasive  explorations  were inconclu-  
sive. Non-invasive  explorations  included  medical  history,  neurological  
examination,  brain imaging  (e.g. MRI, PET, SPECT)  and long-term  scalp 
video-EEG  monitoring.  The continuous  (24/7) video-EEG  monitoring  
with intracranial  electrodes  took place in the Epilepsy  Unit of the Pitié- 
Salpêtrière  Hospital  (Paris, France)  and started the day after the implan-  
tation. Recordings  lasted for 2 to 3 weeks, depending  on whether  enough  
informative  seizures  were recorded.  All patients  provided  informed  and 
written  consent  for the implantation  of microelectrodes,  which received  
approval  from local ethic committees  (CPP Paris VI, CNRS, 2004, 2006; 
INSERM  C11-16,  C19-55).  
2.2. Planning  of stereotactic  electrode  placement  
Electrode  planning  was carried out by epileptologists,  neurosurgeons  
and neuroradiologists,  days or weeks before implantation.  Macroelec-  
trode trajectories  and targets were deﬁned  only based on clinical  ob- 
jectives.  They were very speciﬁc  to each patient and trajectories  were 
not necessarily  orthogonal  to the brain surface.  The planiﬁcation  of 
macro-microelectrodes  trajectories  was not inﬂuenced  by the decision  
of adding a microelectrode.  Microelectrodes  were added to a macroelec-  
trode when there was enough  gray matter beyond  the last macrocontact  
for the microwires  to expand  into. As the original  20 mm length of the 
microwires  was too long, they were cut at a length calculated  during 
trajectory  planning.  
Until end of 2017, macroelectrode  trajectories  were planned  ac- 
cording  to a stereotactic  Leksell frame and based on pre-implantation  
brain MRI, using iplan® stereotaxy,  version",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5157, 5160), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(13231, 13235), match='  3.'>"

ministration  ( Huang et al., 2014 ), while another  speciﬁcally  focusing  on 
the social eﬀects of oxytocin,  found that chronic  administration  actually  
hinders  some social behaviors  in prairie voles ( Bales et al., 2014 ). Only 
three clinical  trials found improvements  with chronic  administration,  
all with relatively  low sample sizes ( n = 18, 19, 30) ( Anagnostou  et al., 
2012 ; Watanabe  et al., 2015 ; Yatawara  et al., 2016 ), while most re- 
cently, a large clinical  trial ( n = 250) showed  no signiﬁcant  eﬀect of 
treatment  on social or cognitive  functioning  over a period of 24 weeks 
( Sikich et al., 2021 ). In contrast,  a recent review of the oxytocin  lit- 
erature,  assessing  28 studies including  randomized,  single- or double-  
blind/open-label  and placebocontrolled  clinical  trials as well as single- 
arm, non-randomized  and uncontrolled  studies,  found oxytocin  had ben- 
eﬁcial eﬀects on social functioning,  but did not ﬁnd strong evidence  for 
symptoms  improvement  in the nonsocial  domain  ( Huang et al., 2021) . 
As Huang et al. (2014) put it, there seems to be a ""translational  hurdle""  
in the movement  of oxytocin  from acute studies to chronic.  Despite  the 
promise  of acute treatment,  given the lifelong  nature of the disorder  and 
its symptoms,  chronic  treatment  is likely the only way amelioration  of 
autism symptoms  would occur. 
Moreover,  there is a gap in our knowledge  surrounding  oxytocin’s  
eﬀects on the brain. A number  of neuroimaging  studies investigating  
oxytocin’s  eﬀect on neural activity  during behavioral  tasks found en- 
hanced  brain activity  predictive  of behavioral  eﬀects due to treatment  
( Andari et al., 2020 , 2016 ; Aoki et al., 2014 ; Aoki and Yamasue,  2015 ; 
Benner et al., 2021 ; Gordon  et al., 2013 ; Watanabe  et al., 2014 , 2015 ). 
But these eﬀects are (1) from a diverse  number  of regions  across the 
brain, including  the amygdala,  the anterior  cingulate  cortex, the ante- 
rior insula, the hippocampus,  the medial prefrontal  cortex, the striatum,  
and others, (2) from studies with low sample sizes ( < 40 participants)  
and (3) were observed  using acute oxytocin  administration,  leaving  
our understanding  of where the drug acts (and modulates  downstream)  
after administration  limited,  despite knowing  where oxytocin  recep- 
tors are located  (see Fig. 2 ) ( Benarroch,  2013 ; Gould and Zingg, 2003 ; 
Quintana  et al., 2019 ) and our understanding  of some of the eﬀects oxy- 
tocin has on neural activity  in the context  of social behavior.  
This problem  is further exacerbated  by the pharmacology  of oxy- 
tocin. The neuropeptide  is too large to cross the blood brain barrier and 
has a very short halﬂife ( Neumann  et al., 2013 ). Therefore,  an admin- 
istration  method  is needed  that quickly  and directly  allows oxytocin  to 
enter the brain. Though  methods  like intracerebroventricular  (ICV) in- 
fusion and peripheral  injections  have been used in animal models,  there 
is a need for a method  that is easily employed  by humans  (as opposed  to 
the intravenous  (IV) lines used for labor induction).  Intranasal  adminis-  
tration allows for simple,  non-invasive  treatment  that circumvents  the 
issues with the blood brain barrier and is easily used both in humans  
and in mice ( Neumann  et al., 2013 ). Although  recent literature  sug- 
gests this is a promising  mode of administration  ( Galbusera  et al., 2017 ; 
Pagani et al., 2020 ), some debate surrounds  whether  oxytocin  really 
crosses the blood brain barrier.  For example,  Leng and Ludwig  (2016) ar- 
gued that the treatment  eﬀects observed  in studies assessing  intranasal  
oxytocin  (like in Neumann  et al., 2013 ) were solely due to peripheral  
treatment  eﬀects. A method  that accurately  assesses  oxytocin’s  ability 
to enter the brain is needed  to settle this debate.  
Importantly,  given the substantial  heterogeneity  of ASD, there is 
a need for studies to delineate  phenotype-based  subsets that may re- 
spond to oxytocin  treatment  ( Ecker and Murphy,  2014 ; Guastella  and 
Hickie, 2016 ). This is perhaps  best demonstrated  by Engelman  and col- 
leagues  ( 2008 ) in their co-clinical  study of lung cancer.  A clinical  trial 
of a promising  therapeutic  failed to show treatment  eﬀect in their pop- 
ulation.  They simultaneously  treated three diﬀerent  genetic  knockout  
mouse strains,  with the same treatment  used in humans.  The group re- 
alized that two of the strains responded  100% to the treatment,  while 
one did not. Armed with this genetic  information,  they divided  the clin- 
ical population  into subsets by genotype  and found that, in fact, all the 
patients  not carrying  the genetic  mutation  of the non-responder  mouse 
model improved  with the treatment.  To this end, a study is necessary  that incorporates  numerous  phenotypes  across multiple  mouse lines, and 
also makes use of multivariate  analyses  to inform clinical  trials, all in 
the context  of ASD. 
Numerous  studies have spoken to the utility of magnetic  resonance  
imaging  (MRI) in the stratiﬁcation  of ASD individuals  into biologi-  
cally homogeneous  subgroups  ( Bernhardt  et al., 2016 ; Ecker and Mur- 
phy, 2014 ; Hong et al., 2018 ; Hrdlicka  et al., 2005 ; Kushki et al., 2019 ). 
Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) oﬀers the ability to quantify  the 
structural  phenotype  of both mice and humans,  allowing  for whole 
brain coverage  and translatability  to human imaging  studies,  both in 
acquisition  and analysis  ( Chen and Nieman,  2011 ; Hong et al., 2018 ; 
Lerch et al., 2011 ; Nieman  et al., 2018 ; Szulc et al., 2015 ). It also af- 
fords the additional  advantages  of high-throughput,  having a link with 
behavior  ( Anacker  et al., 2016 ; Ellegood  et al., 2015 , 2013 ; Lerch et al., 
2011 ; Nieman  et al., 2007 ), and showing  evidence  of plasticity  with 
exposure  ( Vousden,  2018 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). 
Perhaps  most importantly,  MRI has shown sensitivity  to the neuro- 
logical eﬀects of interventions  like drugs ( Bade et al., 2017 ; Dudek et al., 
2015 , 2016 ; Lu et al., 2007 ; Perrine  et al., 2015 ; Scholz et al., 2015 ; 
van der Plas et al., 2020 ; Vousden,  2018 ; Wheeler  et al., 2013 ; 
Zhang et al., 2018 ). These studies point to the utility of using MRI to 
characterize  structural  plasticity  in response  to pharmacology.  This al- 
lows the ability to assess whether  oxytocin  modiﬁes  brain circuits  and 
whether  it does so variably  depending  on genotype.  
To explore  if we could understand  patterns  of response  in mice, we 
executed  a mouse study in parallel,  akin to a co-clinical  trial. Speciﬁ-  
cally, a large randomized,  blinded,  placebo-controlled,  preclinical  study 
on chronic  intranasal  oxytocin  treatment  in three diﬀerent  mouse mod- 
els related to autism was performed  with a focus on using neuroanatom-  
ical phenotypes  to assess and subset treatment  response.  A wide range 
of behavioural  measures  was also assayed  in a high-throughput  method  
of treatment  evaluation.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
Three in-bred  strains of autism mouse models were used: the 
16p11.2  heterozygous  knockout  (B6129S-Del(7Slx1b-Sept1)4Aam/J;  
JAX #013,128)  ( Horev et al., 2011) ) (henceforth  referred  to as 
"" 16p ""), the Fmr1 hemizygous  knockout  (FVB.129P2Pde6b  + Tyrc-ch  
Fmr1tm1Cgr/J;  JAX #004,624)  (Bakker  et al., 1994 ) (henceforth  
referred  to as "" Fmr1 ""), and the Shank3  exon 4–9 (ANK domain)  
homozygous  knockout  (B6(Cg)-Shank3tm1.2Bux/J;  JAX #017,890)  
( Bozdagi  et al., 2010 ) (henceforth  referred  to as "" Shank3  ""). The mice 
were on the following  background  strains,  respectively:  B6129SF1/J  
(JAX #101,043)(henceforth  referred  to as ""129 ″ ), FVB.129P2Pde6b  + 
Tyrc-ch/AntJ  (JAX #004,828)(henceforth  referred  to as ""FVB""), 
C57BL/6  J (JAX #000,664)(henceforth  referred  to as ""C57""). 
These strains were chosen because  they were genetic  models with 
high face validity.  Speciﬁcally,  they are models with strong analogies  to 
the human condition.  For example,  the Fmr1 mouse line is a well studied  
model of the most common  single gene mutation  related to autism.  More 
pragmatic  considerations  like availability  were also considered,  along 
with the models’  distributions  in the clusters  from Ellegood  et al. (2015) . 
Active colonies  for each strain were maintained  at The center for 
Phenogenomics  (TCP). Breeders  were set up to yield control litter-mates  
for each strain. Speciﬁcally,  for the 16p strain, heterozygous  mice were 
bred with wildtype  129 mice to yield the desired  heterozygous  mutants  
and wildtype  control litter-mates.  For the Fmr1 strain, heterozygous  fe- 
males were bred with wildtype  males to yield hemizygous  males and 
wildtype  control litter-mates.  For the Shank3  mice, two heterozygous  
mice were bred to yield homozygous  Shank3  mutants  and wildtype  con- 
trol littermates.  
Mice were group housed,  and an attempt  was made to achieve  a 
sample size of 14 male mice per genotype,  per strain, per treatment

( Table 2 ). The sample size was chosen based oﬀa power analysis  con- 
ducted a priori that determined  that 14 subjects  in each group should 
be suﬃcient  to detect group diﬀerences,  based oﬀthe variability  in the 
chosen neuroanatomical  phenotypes.  Data was collected  and analyzed  
for all mice for all behavioral  tests, except for sociability.  Although  the 
software  appeared  to be recording,  the authors  later discovered  that one 
of the laptops  failed to acquire  the sociability  data, leading  to a loss of 
approximately  40% of the social behavior  data (reduced  sample sizes 
are displayed  in Table 2 b). 
All studies and procedures  were approved  by the TCP Animal  Care 
Committee,  in accordance  with recommendations  of the Canadian  Coun- 
cil on Animal  Care, the requirements  under the Animals  for Research  
Act, RSO1980,  and the TCP Committee  Policies  and Guidelines.  Mice 
were maintained  under controlled  conditions  (25 C, 12 h cycle) at TCP in 
sterile, individually  ventilated  cages and were provided  standard  chow 
(Harlan,  Teklad Global)  and sterile water ad libitum  via an automated  
watering  system.  
2.2. Experimental  time-line  
The experimental  time-line  is outlined  in Fig. 1 . At ﬁve weeks of age, 
mice underwent  in vivo manganese-enhanced  magentic  resonance  imag- 
ing (MEMRI)  scanning  and were randomly  assigned  to a treatment  group 
(oxytocin  or placebo)  such that the experimenter  remained  blinded.  
Mice were treated everyday,  for 28 days total. After an in vivo MEMRI  
scan at postnatal  week 8, mice were assessed  on four diﬀerent  behav- 
ioral paradigms,  while still receiving  treatment.  At nine weeks of age, 
the mice were scanned  with in vivo MEMRI  once more, perfused,  and 
scanned  ex vivo at a later time-point.  The study was designed  to be an 
exploratory  study and therefore  no primary  outcome  was deﬁned  before 
the study started.  
The protocol  was designed  to maximize  throughput,  and therefore  
the measures  chosen were quick to perform,  with little intervention  or 
lasting eﬀects. The behavioral  tests were conducted  in proximity  to each 
other to minimize  the variability  between  the brain and behavioral  phe- 
notypes  ( Crawley,  2007 ; Paylor et al., 2006 ). Similarly,  the age of the 
mice was chosen so that single day variations  would not have large ef- 
fects on brain or behavioral  phenotypes.  The length of treatment  was 
chosen to probe chronic  treatment  eﬀects, while remaining  manageable  
for highthroughput.  To increase  replicability,  the ex vivo scan was per- 
formed  to parallel  the protocol  from Ellegood  et al. (2015) . Great care 
was taken in the conception  of this project to ensure that eﬀects ob- 
served would be due to treatment  and not confounding  eﬀects. Pilot 
testing involving  wildtype  mice was employed  to ensure expected  neu- 
roanatomical  and behavioral  results before the main study commenced.  
Although  it is typical to space behavioral  tests apart by several days, 
the methods  employed  were developed  to increase  throughput  to max- 
imize the number  of subjects  in the study, thereby  increasing  the sta- 
tistical power to detect a treatment  eﬀect ( Crawley,  2007 ; Paylor et al., 
2006 ). Data from this study was compared  to the literature  as well as 
previous  data acquired  from the lab to ensure that the distribution  of the 
data was expected.  Speciﬁcally,  if an eﬀect of methodology  was present,  
Fig. 2. Figure depicting  OXTR gene expression  information  in the adult mouse 
brain overlaid  on a neuroanatomical  map to depict how OXTR gene expression  
energy varies (yellow is greatest).  We would expect the greatest volume changes  
from oxytocin  treatment  to occur in areas with the highest oxytocin  aﬃnity. In 
the brain, OXTRs are most abundant  in the olfactory  system, the central nucleus 
of the amygdala,  the CA1 region of the hippocampus,  the ventromedial  hypotha-  
lamus, and the nucleus accumbens  ( Benarroch  (2013) ; Gould and Zingg (2003) ). 
Gene expression  data was gathered  from the Allen Institute,  following  meth- 
ods previously  described  ( Carriere  et al. (2020) ; Fernandes  et al. (2017) ; 
Lein et al. (2007) ; Lindenmaier  et al. (2021) ; Sunkin et al. (2012) ; Yee (2019) ). 
the distribution  of the data from later behavioral  tests (i.e. Open Field) 
would skew from the expected  distribution  based oﬀ previous  litera- 
ture (where the test was employed  alone or spaced apart from other 
tests). Expected  diﬀerences  due to genotype  (i.e. placebo-treated  16p vs 
placebo-treated  129 control)  would also be altered if an eﬀect of pro- 
tocol was present.  Other measures  were additionally  implemented  to 
ensure minimal  interference;  for example,  the order the behavioral  tests 
were performed  was chosen based oﬀ studies  investigating  eﬀects of 
training  history ( Crawley,  2007 ; McIlwain  et al., 2001 ).

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118786,"2. Subject sample size in neuroimaging  
Statistical  inferences  are contingent  on the magnitude  of an eﬀect 
relative  to its uncertainty.  For example,  if the average  BOLD response  
in a brain region is 0.8% signal change with a standard  error of 0.3%, 
the statistical  evidence  is considered  strong for the eﬀect of interest.  On 
the other hand, if the standard  error is 0.6%, we would conclude  that the 
statistical  evidence  for this eﬀect is lacking  because  the data cannot be 
eﬀectively  diﬀerentiated  from noise. Now if the standard  error of 0.6% 
is based on data from only 10 participants,  we may consider  collecting  
more data before reaching  the conclusion  of a lack of strong evidence  
for the eﬀect. 
It is surprisingly  diﬃcult  to predetermine  an appropriate  sample size 
in neuroimaging.  In the early days a small sample size might have eﬃ- 
ciently addressed  many questions  on how cognitive  operations  are im- 
plemented  in the brain (e.g., mean brain activation  in speciﬁc  regions  
with large eﬀect magnitudes  alongside  relatively  low uncertainty).  For 
example,  based on data from somatosensory  tasks, one study indicated  
that as little as 12 subjects  were suﬃcient  to detect the desired  group 
activation  patterns  (without  considering  multiple  testing adjustments)  
( Desmond  and Glover,  2002 ) and 24 subjects  would be needed  to com- 
pensate  for the multiplicity  issue. A few power analysis  methodologies  
have been developed  over the years that are intended  to assist investi-  
gators in choosing  an appropriate  number  of subjects  (e.g., fMRIPower  
( Mumford,  2012 ), Neurodesign  ( Durnez  et al., 2016 ), Ostwald  et al., 
2019 ). Yet, even with these tools, power analyses  are rarely performed  
in neuroimaging  studies according  to a recent survey ( Szucs and Ioan- 
nidis, 2020 ): the median  subject number  was 12 among the 1000 most 
cited papers during 1990–2012,  and 23 among the 300 most cited pa- 
pers during 2017–2018;  only 3–4% of these reported  pre-study  power 
analyses.  In fact, unless required  for a grant application,  most experi- 
ments are simply designed  with sample sizes chosen to match previous  
studies.  
Determining  requisite  sample sizes for neuroimaging  studies is chal- 
lenging.  First, there is substantial  heterogeneity  in eﬀect sizes across 
brain regions;  thus, a sample size might be reasonable  for some brain 
regions,  but not for others. Second,  the conventional  modeling  approach  
(massively  univariate  analysis  followed  by multiple  testing adjustment)  
is another  complicating  factor. Because  of the complex  relationship  be- 
tween the strength  of statistical  evidence  and spatial extent, it is not 
easy to perform  power analysis  while considering  the multiplicity  is- 
sue (e.g. permutation-based  adjustment).  Third, imaging  analyses  in- 
herently  involve  multiple  nested levels of data and confounds,  which 
presents  a daunting  task for modeling.  For instance,  a typical experiment  
may involve  several of these levels: trials, conditions  (or tasks), runs, ses- 
sions, subjects,  groups and population.  Finally,  there are also practical,  
non-statistical  considerations  involved,  such as feasibility,  costs, scanner  
availability,  etc. Even though recent work has led to better characteri-  
zations of FMRI data hierarchy  ( Westfall  et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020; 
Chen et al., 2021 ), challenges  of sample size determination  remain from 
both modeling  and computational  perspectives.  
Theoretically,  a large subject sample size should certainly  help probe 
eﬀects with a small magnitude  and account  for a multitude  of demo- 
graphic,  phenotypic  and genetic  covariates.  As such, several big data ini- 
tiatives  have been conducted  or are currently  underway,  including  the 
Human  Connectome  Project (HCP), Adolescent  Brain Cognitive  Devel- 
opment  (ABCD),  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Neuroimaging  Initiative  (ADNI),  Enhancing  NeuroImaging  Genetics  through  Meta Analysis  (ENIGMA),  
UK Biobank  Brain Imaging,  etc. Undoubtedly,  such initiatives  are valu- 
able to the research  community  and will continue  to provide  unique 
opportunities  to explore  various  aspects  of cognition,  emotion  and men- 
tal health. On the other hand, these initiatives  come with high ex- 
penditure,  infrastructure  requirements  and analytical  hurdles  (diﬀerent  
sites/scanners/software).  Is ‘big data’ really the best or only solution  
to achieving  high precision  for small-to-medium  eﬀects?  For research  
questions  where resources  are limited (e.g., rare diseases,  non-human  
primates),  recruiting  a large number  of potential  participants  may be 
out of the question.  In these cases, one may wonder  what alternative  
strategies  are available  to achieve  similar or even higher statistical  eﬃ- 
ciency with the limited number  of participants  or resources  available.  
In setting up an experiment,  the choice of subject sample size is a 
trade-oﬀ between  statistical  and practical  considerations.  On the one 
hand, estimation  eﬃciency  is assumed  to increase  with the sample size; 
thus, the larger the subject sample size, the more certain the ﬁnal eﬀect 
estimation.  On the other hand, costs (of money,  time, labor etc.) increase  
with each added “sample  ”( i . e . , subject);  funding  grants are ﬁnite, as 
is scanner  time and even the research  analyst’s  time. Even though a 
cost-eﬀectiveness  analysis  is rarely performed  in practice,  this trade-oﬀ
does play a pivotal role for most investigations  as resources  are usually  
limited.

shown the potential  of characterizing  selected  features  of WM in neu- 
rodegenerative  and other disorders.  
The standard  approach  that has been widely used in fMRI studies of 
GM uses a general  linear model (GLM) to detect activations  that cor- 
respond  to a change in the local BOLD signal magnitude,  but this may 
not be appropriate  for WM as suggested  by previous  reports ( Li et al., 
2019 ). The GLM assumes  that the BOLD response  to stimulation  may be 
treated as a linear shift-invariant  system so that the BOLD signals can be 
modeled  by convolving  the time course of neural activities  with a hemo- 
dynamic  response  function  (HRF). The GLM assumes  that evoked  neu- 
ral activations  are synchronous  with the timings  of presented  stimuli or 
tasks that trigger hemodynamic  responses  ( Poline and Brett, 2012 ) and 
correspond  to a change in signal magnitude.  This assumption  may not be 
valid in all situations,  especially  in WM because  it ignores  intrinsic  brain 
activities  that preexist  in the background  and are unrelated  to extrin- 
sic stimuli.  Such intrinsic  brain activities  were considered  noise before 
they were found to predict spatial patterns  of functional  connectivity  
(i.e., functional  networks)  in a resting state ( Zhang and Raichle,  2010 ; 
Laird et al., 2011 ). A voxel in WM contains  a large number  of axons 
that connect  neurons  in diﬀerent  positions  in GM ( Schilling  et al., 2018 ; 
Voigt et al., 2019 ) and these may produce  asynchronous  neuronal  sig- 
nals so that fMRI signals measured  in a WM voxel may be more com- 
plex than those in GM and thus inconsistent  with stimuli in tasks. A 
further assumption  in the GLM is that the HRF keeps ﬁxed for all po- 
sitions, as implemented  in SPM ( Poline and Brett, 2012 ). This assump-  
tion is not valid in all WM as previous  studies have shown that HRFs 
measured  in WM exhibit substantial  regional  variations  ( Li et al., 2019 ; 
Courtemanche  et al., 2018 ). A potential  solution  to the issue of the spa- 
tially varying  HRF is to use variants  of a GLM that allow spatial-adaptive  
HRFs to be estimated  by a set of Finite Impulse  Response  (FIR) bases 
( Kay et al., 2008 ). However,  multiple  coeﬃcients  associated  with the 
set of FIR functional  bases need to be determined  in the modeling  of 
HRF, where the noise-dependent  overﬁtting  in such approaches  may 
prevent  accurate  activation  mapping  ( Vincent  et al., 2010 ). Moreover,  
many studies demonstrate  that the hemodynamic  responses  character-  
ized by BOLD signals are nonlinear  in GM, where the hemodynamic  
responses  are time-dependent  and thus BOLD signals cannot be mod- 
eled by the convolution  that is implemented  in GLM (see the review 
in ( Polimeni  and Lewis, 2021 )). The nonlinearity  of hemodynamic  re- 
sponses  would also exist in WM, which could also result in the invalidity  
of the GLM assumption.  Besides,  fMRI signal ﬂuctuations  in WM are sub- 
stantially  lower than those in GM ( Yarkoni  et al., 2009 ) due to the sub- 
stantially  lower blood volume  in WM compared  to GM ( Gawryluk  et al., 
2014 ; Jochimsen  et al., 2010 ) and the resulting  lower BOLD signal- 
noise-ratio  poses additional  challenges  to the analysis  of WM. 
A model-free  approach,  without  the assumptions  mentioned  above, 
that produces  robust detection  of activity-related  BOLD signals in WM is 
thus needed.  An alternative  to the GLM that incorporates  the temporal  
coherence  of a voxel with respect to its neighbors  may provide  a means 
of activation  mapping  without  modeling  the BOLD signal or assuming  
local changes  in signal magnitude.  This approach  is inspired  by previous  
ﬁndings  that the regional  homogeneity  (ReHo)  of fMRI signals in GM is 
modulated  by stimuli presented  in tasks ( Zang et al., 2004 ; Yuan et al., 
2013 ; Lv et al., 2013 ). The ReHo approach  relies on the fact that voxels 
within a GM volume  at a macroscopic  scale constitute  a functional  unit 
in which the synchrony  of inter-voxel  time courses  can be enhanced  
under functional  loading.  In contrast  to GM, anatomical  structures  of 
the WM feature complex  interwoven  networks,  in which ﬁbrous tissues 
constitute  elongated  functional  units for neural signal transmission  and 
thus show structural  anisotropy.  Brain functional  processes  embedded  
in such an anisotropic  substrate  should also exhibit anisotropic  spatial 
proﬁles.  This has been demonstrated  by previous  studies of BOLD signals 
in WM ( Ding et al., 2013 ; Ding et al., 2016 ; Schilling  et al., 2019 ), which 
reported  structure-speciﬁc  temporal  correlations  along WM tracts in a 
resting state that become  more pronounced  in relevant  structures  under 
a task loading.  Given the relationships  between  local ﬁber architectures  and WM function,  we propose  a new approach  for mapping  activity-  
related BOLD signals in WM that incorporates  a metric of BOLD signal 
synchrony.  This approach  introduces  two technical  innovations.  First, 
an adaptive  spatial window  in the form of ﬁber-architecture  informed  
neighborhood  is created  for each voxel, within which time courses  are 
collected  and weighted.  The neighborhood  is determined  using diﬀu- 
sion orientation  distribution  functions  (ODFs) obtained  from high an- 
gular resolution  diﬀusion  imaging  (HARDI)  data. A similar concept  was 
proposed  in a previous  report that used anisotropic  spatial ﬁltering  to 
enhance  noisy BOLD contrasts  in WM ( Abramian  et al., 2021 ). Second,  a 
modiﬁed  principal  component  analysis  (PCA) is applied  to time courses  
of fMRI data to estimate  the synchrony  of time courses  within the ﬁber- 
architecture-informed  window  of each voxel. Taken together,  the pro- 
posed approach  overcomes  the intrinsic  limitations  of GLM based anal- 
yses of BOLD signals in WM. 
In the following,  the proposed  model-free  mapping  of neural activa- 
tions is illustrated  using a 3T fMRI dataset from the Human  Connectome  
Project (HCP) at a group level. First, spatial patterns  within activation  
maps are evaluated  by reference  to anatomical  structures  of WM ﬁbers 
derived  from diﬀusion  MRI. Then, the inﬂuence  of task loading  on ac- 
tivation  are investigated  by comparing  activation  maps derived  from 
motor-task  fMRI data with those acquired  in a resting-state.  Motor-task  
enhanced  activations  in WM are demonstrated  in WM regions  related 
to the primary  motor cortex, or M1, which are determined  by WM ﬁber 
tracking  with seed points in M1. Furthermore,  the sensitivity,  speciﬁcity  
and reproducibility  of the proposed  method  are assessed  statistically  
based on ﬁber-tracking-based  parcellations  of task-related  and unrelated  
WM regions.  
2. Methods  
The proposed  approach  consists  of two major steps implemented  on a 
voxel-by-voxel  basis ( Fig. 1 ). First, a ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial 
window  is created  for each voxel using ODFs constructed  from HARDI 
data. Second,  a modiﬁed  PCA is used to estimate  the synchrony  of fMRI 
time courses  based on this spatial window.  Detailed  algorithms  and pro- 
cedures  of the proposed  approach  are described  as follows.  
2.1. Design of ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial window  
Principles  from the recently  emerging  ﬁeld of graph signal process-  
ing (GSP) ( Shuman  et al., 2013 ; Ortega et al., 2018 ) provide  an ele- 
gant framework  to design the ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial win- 
dow. Based on the GSP framework,  we analyze  fMRI time courses  at a 
discrete  set of positions,  which form a set of vertices  of a topological  
graph, in such a way that underlying  constraints  from ﬁber architec-  
tures can be accounted  for by edges of the graph. Here, we denote a 
graph as 𝐆 = { 𝐕 , 𝐄 , 𝐖 as usual, which consists  of a ﬁnite set of vertices  
𝐕 with |𝐕 |= N , a set of edges 𝐄 , and a weighted  connection  matrix 𝐖 . 
𝐖 𝑖,𝑗 represents  the connection  strength  of edge 𝑒 = ( i , j ) that connects  
vertices  i and j . On the vertices  of the graph, we deﬁne a vector f ∈ℝ N 
to represent  a set of auxiliary  quantities  to be used to generate  spatial 
windows,  where the i -th component  of the vector, 𝐟( 𝑖 ) , represents  the 
value at the i -th vertex in 𝐕 . 
For this study, voxel-wise  graphs are constructed  using ODFs derived  
from HARDI data with an isotropic  voxel size, which have been well de- 
scribed  in previous  reports ( Abramian  et al., 2021 ; Iturria-Medina  et al., 
2007 ). In each graph, every vertex corresponds  to a voxel in 3D MR im- 
ages with weighted  connections  to its neighbors.  The connection  weight 
of any two neighboring  voxels depends  on the coherence  of diﬀusion  ori- 
entations  between  the two voxels. As a result, two neighboring  voxels 
residing  in the same ﬁber tract have relative  larger weight than those in 
diﬀerent  ﬁber tracts. Note that a high angular  resolution,  a high voxel 
resolution  and an isotropic  voxel size of diﬀusion  MRI data are beneﬁ- 
cial to accurately  characterize  ﬁber-architecture-informed  connections  
in the graph.

Fig. 1. Schematic  of ﬁber architecture  informed  synchrony  mapping  in human white matter (WM). The algorithm  of the proposed  approach  consists of two major 
steps. First, a spatial window  is created for each voxel based on local ﬁber architectures.  In this step, orientation  distribution  functions  (ODFs) constructed  from 
diﬀusion  MRI data provide the information  on ﬁber architectures,  which are then used to generate  a topological  graph for WM. In this graph, every vertex corresponds  
to a voxel in MR images, with weighted  connections  to its neighbors.  The edge weights are determined  by the coherence  between  the directions  of diﬀusion  and 
the orientation  of the graph edges. Then, diﬀusion  on the graph with a point source located at each vertex is simulated  to produce  a diﬀusion  proﬁle that can be 
further used as a ﬁber-architecture-informed  window  (FAIWs).  Here, typical FAIWs created for four voxels ( P1, P2, P3 and P4 ) demonstrate  that they are adaptive  
to local ﬁber architectures.  Second, a modiﬁed  PCA is implemented  to estimate  the synchrony  of fMRI time courses based on the FAIWs from the ﬁrst step to yield 
activation  maps. In the modiﬁed  PCA, the FAIWs emphasize  the time courses associated  to voxels near the central position  with high weights,  which ensures the 
spatial speciﬁcity  of the synchrony  estimate.  
Building  on the topological  properties  of the ﬁber-architecture-  
informed  graph, a spatial window  is created  for each vertex/voxel  by 
simulating  diﬀusion  on the graph with point sources  located  at each ver- 
tex. A kernel is deﬁned  for the diﬀusion  process  in the spectral  domain,  
which is derived  from a Laplacian  matrix deﬁned  in GSP. Speciﬁcally,  
a Laplacian  matrix of 𝐆 is deﬁned  as 𝐋 = 𝐃 − 𝐖 , where 𝐃 denotes  the 
graph’s  degree matrix,  which is diagonal  with elements  𝑑 𝑖,𝑖 = ∑
𝑗 𝐰 𝑖,𝑗 ; the 
graph operator  𝐋 is a real symmetric  matrix,  and thus has a complete  
set of orthonormal  eigenvectors  { 𝑢 𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑁 and associated  eigenval-  
ues { 𝜆𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑁 satisfying  𝐋 𝑢 𝓁 = 𝜆𝓁 𝑢 𝓁 . With these eigenvectors,  the 
graph signal 𝐟can be transformed  into the spectral  domain,  
̂𝐟 ( 𝓁 ) = 𝑁 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝑢 T 
𝓁 ( 𝑖 ) 𝐟 ( 𝑖 ) = 𝑢 T 
𝓁 𝐟, 𝓁 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑁 (1) 
This spectral  representation  allows an exact reconstruction,  i.e., the 
signal 𝐟can be recovered  as 
𝐟 = 𝑁 ∑
𝓁=1 ̂𝐟 ( 𝓁 ) 𝑢 𝓁 ⋅ (2) 
In the graph spectral  domain,  the kernel of diﬀusion  ( Turner,  2002 ) 
can be deﬁned  as 
𝐾 ( 𝜆) = 𝑒 − 𝜏𝜆(3) 
where 𝜏is a free parameter  determining  the spatial extent of diﬀusion  
on a graph, and it can be intuitively  treated as the duration  of diﬀusion.  
Given an initial point source 𝐟 0 ( t = 0), the transient  diﬀusion  proﬁle at 
time point t can be derived  as 
𝐟 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑𝑁 
𝓁=1 𝐾 (𝜆𝓁 )̂𝐟 0 ( 𝓁 ) 𝑢 𝓁 = ∑𝑁 
𝓁=1 𝑒 − 𝜆𝓁 𝑡 𝑢 T 
𝓁 𝐟 0 𝑢 𝓁 (4) 
To create a spatial window  centered  at a voxel i we deﬁne this point 
source by setting the initial proﬁle 𝐟 0 to be equal to 1 at the position  i 
and 0 otherwise.  The transient  proﬁle 𝐟( 𝑡 ) at the time point t is further 
processed  to yield the ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial window,  the 
width of which can be adjusted  by the parameter  𝜏. To be speciﬁc,  the window  is deﬁned  by taking voxels with 𝑀largest values of 𝐟( 𝑡 ) , which 
is subsequently  normalized  with their summation,  
𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗 ) = 𝐟 ( 𝑗, 𝜏) ∕ 𝑀 ∑
𝑗=1 𝐟 ( 𝑗, 𝜏) (5) 
In this study, the largest parameter  𝑀is taken under an empirical  
constraint  ∑𝑀 
𝑗=1 𝐟( 𝑗, τ) > 0 . 95 , wherein  small values in the diﬀusion  pro- 
ﬁle of each voxel are removed  to improve  computational  eﬃciency.  
2.2. PCA based on ﬁber-architecture-informed  window  
In previous  reports,  the synchrony  of fMRI time-courses  in a parcel- 
lated region have been quantiﬁed  using PCA ( Tian et al., 2020 ), wherein  
the variance  explained  by the ﬁrst principal  component  gauges the ex- 
tent of synchrony.  Here, the conventional  PCA is modiﬁed  to allow the 
integration  of ﬁber architecture  information,  referred  to as a modiﬁed  
PCA based on a ﬁber-architecture-informed  window  (FAIW-PCA).  Basi- 
cally, the raw fMRI time courses  are ﬁrst normalized  with respect to the 
mean values and the standard  deviations.  Then, within each window  F 𝑖 
centered  at the position  i, the normalized  time courses  are rearranged  
into a matrix ( X ) of dimension  T ×M , where T denotes  the number  of 
time frames and M the number  of voxels within the window.  We denote 
a time course in X as 𝑥 𝑖 , the i-th column  in the matrix X, and formu- 
late the FAIW-PCA  as an optimization  problem,  where the ﬁrst principal  
component  𝑣 1 can be obtained  by 
𝑣 1 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚 ax 
‖𝑣 ‖=1 { 𝑀 ∑
𝑗=1 𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗 ) ⋅(𝑥 𝑗 ⋅𝑣 )2 } 
(6) 
Note that, without  the weights  𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗) , this optimization  problem  
will degenerate  into a conventional  PCA. Here, 𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗) is applied  in the 
optimization  such that the time courses  associated  with the voxels near 
the center position  are emphasized  more in the ﬁrst principal  compo-  
nent obtained,  which emphasizes  the spatial speciﬁcity  of the synchrony  
3  Y. Zhao, Y. Gao, Z. Zu et al. NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119399 
estimate.  We further write this optimization  in matrix form, 
𝑣 1 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 max 
‖𝑣 ‖=1 {𝑣 𝑇 X 𝑇 QX 𝑣 }(7) 
where the matrix Q = diag [ ( 𝐅 𝑖 (1) , 𝐅 𝑖 (2) , ..., 𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑀 ) ] . With simple alge- 
braic manipulations,  Eq. (7) can be written  as 
𝑣 1 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 max { 
𝑣 𝑇 H 𝑣 
𝑣 𝑇 𝑣 } 
(8) 
where H = X 𝑇 QX . H is a positive-deﬁnite  matrix,  and thus has a com- 
plete set of orthonormal  eigenvectors  { 𝑣 𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑀 and associated  
eigenvalues  { σ𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑀 , σ𝓁 ≥ σ𝓁+1 ≥ 0 that satisfy 𝐇 𝑣 𝓁 = σ𝓁 𝑣 𝓁 . The 
quantity  to be maximized  in Eq. (8) is a Rayleigh  quotient.  The quo- 
tient’s maximum  possible  value is the largest eigenvalue  σ1 , which is 
associated  with the solution  𝑣 1 . Finally,  the synchrony  of time courses  
is estimated  by 
Synchrony  = σ1 ∕ ∑𝑀 
𝓁=1 σ𝓁 (9) 
Note that, as ∑𝑀 
𝓁=1 σ𝓁 = 1 due to the normalization  of the window  
𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗) , the synchrony  can be simply estimated  by σ1 , σ1 ∈[ 0 , 1 ] .

Fig. 1. How non-sinusoidal  shape of the neuronal  
oscillations  impacts the connectivity  of brain re- 
gions. Panel A shows two non-sinusoidal  oscillations  
with their fundamental  frequency  in the alpha band. 
The second harmonics  of these signals are located 
in the beta band. As a byproduct  of the coupling  
of the fundamental  alpha components  (the solid line 
in panel B), the second harmonics  are also coupled 
to each other, which results in spurious  interactions  
within the beta band (the dashed line in panel B) and 
across the two frequency  bands (dotted lines in panel 
B). 
and Palva, 2018b ). Magneto-  and Electroencephalography  (MEG/EEG)  
provide  a unique opportunity  to non-invasively  study these neuronal  
interactions  in humans.  
Since in the frequency  domain  analysis  the kernel function  is si- 
nusoidal,  we often conceptualize  oscillations  as sinusoids.  However,  
neural oscillations  with non-sinusoidal  waveshape  are abundant  in hu- 
man electrophysiological  recordings  ( Cole and Voytek,  2017 ). Such 
non-sinusoidality  reﬂects  complex  trans-membrane  ion currents  ﬂow- 
ing though highly morphologically  asymmetric  neurons  (e.g. pyrami-  
dal cells) where inward and outward  currents  are unlikely  to balance  
each other with the exact temporal  dynamics  thus leading  to diﬀerent  
shape of oscillations  recorded  with EEG/MEG/LFP  (Local ﬁeld poten- 
tial) ( Jones et al., 2009 ). This ubiquity  of the non-sinusoidal  waveform  
of brain oscillations  has signiﬁcant  implications  for the analysis  of brain 
connectivity.  
A periodic  signal can be decomposed  into its harmonic  components  
using Fourier  analysis.  For the sake of clarity, we call the ﬁrst harmonic  
the fundamental  component  and from here on by harmonics  we mean 
the second and higher harmonic  components  whose central frequencies  
are integer multiples  of the fundamental  frequency.  By band-pass  ﬁlter- 
ing the signal around the fundamental  and harmonic  frequencies,  we 
can separate  the respective  components,  which are by construction  CF 
synchronized  to the fundamental  component  ( Hyaﬁl, 2017; Scheﬀer-  
Teixeira  and Tort, 2016 ). Additionally,  if the band-pass  ﬁlters of the 
harmonics  frequency  are wide enough,  a phase-amplitude  coupling  
(PAC) can be observed  between  the fundamental  and harmonic  com- 
ponents  ( Giehl et al., 2021; Hyaﬁl, 2017 ). Note that, as also discussed  
in ( Kramer  et al., 2008 ), non-sinusoidal  signals can be constructed  from 
the mixture  of distinct  sources  with cross-frequency  coupling.  However,  
in this work, we do not distinguish  whether  the non-sinusoidality  origi- 
nates from signal mixing or the intrinsic  waveshape  of the signal. In the 
discussion  section,  we elaborate  on the eﬀect of signal mixing.  
In this manuscript,  we address  the eﬀects of non-sinusoidal  shape 
of the brain oscillations  on the observation  of spurious  interactions  be- 
tween the oscillatory  brain activities.  In spite of other spurious  inter- 
actions (e.g. bias of the data length),  the spurious  interactions  due to 
the waveshape  cannot be determined  by statistical  methods.  For exam- 
ple, our recently  introduced  method  for separating  cross-frequency  cou- 
pled sources  cannot distinguish  sources  with genuine  interactions  and 
those which are coupled  because  of the higher frequency  signal being 
the harmonic  of the lower frequency  one ( Idaji et al., 2020 ) because  a harmonic-driven  synchronization  is not statistically  distinguishable  
from a genuine  coupling.  Therefore,  distinguishing  harmonic-driven  and 
genuine  interactions  has currently  gained more attention  and still re- 
mains as a major challenge  in the MEG/EEG  connectivity  research  ( Giehl 
et al., 2021; Scheﬀer-Teixeira  and Tort, 2016; Siebenhühner  et al., 
2020 ). The main reason of this challenge  is that the connectivity  analysis  
of MEG/EEG  data is typically  done using band-pass  ﬁltering,  which sep- 
arates the fundamental  and harmonic  components  of an oscillatory  ac- 
tivity with a non-sinusoidal  waveform.  As a result, the observed  within-  
and cross-frequency  synchronization  between  the components  in the fre- 
quency  bands of the fundamental  and harmonic  frequencies  can be mis- 
takenly  interpreted  as genuine  interaction.  Figure 1 shows a schematic  
example  where two non-sinusoidal  signals are synchronized.  This cou- 
pling should be manifested  in the synchronization  of the fundamental  
components,  while the harmonic  components  shape the waveform  of the 
individual  signals.  However,  the harmonic  components  are also spuri- 
ously synchronized  and additional  CFS is observed  between  and within 
the regions.  Since these interactions  (shown  in dashed lines in Fig. 1 -B) 
are observed  due to the waveform  of the individual  signals,  they are re- 
ferred to as spurious,  in contrast  to genuine  interactions.  The omnipres-  
ence of these spurious  interactions  in all human MEG/EEG  recordings  
makes the validity  of the previously  studied  within-  and cross-frequency  
connectivity  maps ambiguous.  
There has been an attempt  from Siebenhühner  et al. (2020) to discard 
the potentially  spurious  connections  from cross-frequency  (CF) connec-  
tivity graphs based on the detection  of ambiguous  motifs in the con- 
nectivity  graphs.  In that work, any CFS connection  forming  a triangle  
motif with the local CFS and within-frequency  inter-areal  phase synchro-  
nization  is considered  as ambiguous  and is discarded.  However,  such an 
approach  cannot disentangle  the within-frequency  spurious  interactions  
in the harmonic  frequency  bands, and is speciﬁc  to the CF connectivity  
graphs.  Furthermore,  this approach  cannot distinguish  cases of genuine  
couplings  which form an ambiguous  motif. A more attractive  approach,  
however,  would remove  or suppress  the data components  that can be as- 
sociated  with the harmonics  of the periodic  neuronal  activity.  Such an 
approach  can provide  the opportunity  of using the cleaned  narrow-band  
data (in the frequency  range of the harmonics)  for within-frequency  and 
cross-frequency  connectivity  analyses.  
In the current  work, we introduce  a novel, ﬁrst-of-its-kind  method  for 
removing  eﬀects of harmonics  on the estimation  of within-  and cross- 
frequency  synchronization.  Our method,  called HARMonic  miNImiza-

frequency  equal to 6 Hz is depicted  in the ﬁrst row and the fun- 
damental  6 Hz component  (i.e. the 1st harmonic)  is shown in the 
second row. The 7th harmonic  component  ﬁltered at a frequency  
window  with width of 2 Hz is illustrated  in the third row. Addi- 
tionally,  the sawtooth  signal was ﬁltered around the 7th harmonic

tal component  and the two components  with central frequency  of

lines. The 7th harmonic  on the third row shows a strong 1:7 syn- 
chronization  to the fundamental  component  ( 𝑐𝑜ℎ 1∶7 = 0 . 99 ) and no 
PAC. However,  if ﬁltered at a wider frequency  band, the harmonic  
component  shown in the fourth row shows also a PAC with the fun- 
damental  component.  Note that the amplitude  of the signals and 
their FFT magnitudes  are scaled arbitrarily  for the sake of better 
illustration.  
tion (Harmoni),  is (to the best of our knowledge)  the ﬁrst existing  signal 
processing  tool for suppressing  higher harmonic  components  of a pe- 
riodic signal, without  band-stop  ﬁltering  or rejecting  non-sinusoidally  
shaped signal components  using ICA or any other multi-variate  decom-  
position.  
We extensively  tested Harmoni  with realistic  EEG simulations  and 
show that the spurious  interactions  are alleviated  signiﬁcantly,  while the 
genuine  activities  are not aﬀected.  Harmoni  is then applied  to resting-  
state EEG (rsEEG)  data and we show that the CFS connections  mimicking  
genuine  interactions  are suppressed,  while many masked  remote inter- 
actions are recovered.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Phase-phase  synchronization  
Phase-Phase  Synchronization  (PPS) can be deﬁned  for within-  
frequency  as well as for cross-frequency  (CF) interactions.  In order to 
deﬁne the within-  and cross-frequency  synchronization  indices,  assume  
two complex  narrow-band  signals 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) ∈
ℂ with central frequencies  𝑓 𝑥 and 𝑓 𝑦 , respectively.  Here, by narrow-band  
complex  signal we mean the analytic  signal built using the Hilbert trans- 
form. Formally,  if 𝑥 𝐻 ( 𝑡 ) is the Hilbert transform  of a narrow-band  real 
signal 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) cos ( 𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )) , then 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑗𝑥 𝐻 ( 𝑡 ) is the analytic  
signal of 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) . In these formulations  the index 𝑅 indicates  that the sig- 
nal is real valued and the index 𝐻denotes  a Hilbert transformed  signal. 
Note that, another  way to get the narrow-band  complex  signals from a 
broad-band  signal is complex  wavelet  transforms.  
If 𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑦 then 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) are two narrow-band  signals in the same 
frequency  band. Their complex-valued  coherence  𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) ∈ℂ can be 
computed  from the following  equation:  
𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = < 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗 𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > 
√ 
< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 2 >< 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 2 > (1) 
where < . > is the averaging  operator  over time and 𝑗 = √
−1 is the imag- 
inary number.  
We use the absolute  of the imaginary  part of coherence  (iCoh) 
( Nolte et al., 2004 ) for estimating  the connectivity  between  two signals 
in the same frequency  band. This prevents  a lot of the within-frequency  
spurious  interactions  due to signal mixing and volume  conduction  in 
EEG. 
If 𝑛𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑚𝑓 𝑦 for 𝑚, 𝑛 ∈ℕ , the cross-frequency  synchronization  (CFS, 
known as m:n synchronization)  of 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) can be quantiﬁed  by m:n absolute  coherence  𝑐𝑜ℎ 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) ∈ℝ deﬁned  by the following  equation:  
𝑐𝑜ℎ 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = |< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗 𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝑚𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > |
√ 
< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 2 >< 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 2 > (2) 
which is in principle  similar to m:n phase locking  value as: 
𝑝𝑙𝑣 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 = |< 𝑒 𝑗 𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝑚𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > | (3) 
with the diﬀerence  that in Eq. (2) the amplitudes  of the signals are taken 
into account  and the phase estimations  during higher amplitudes  are 
weighted  higher. Giehl et al. (2021) have used a variant of Eq. (2) . 
Equation  (2) reduces  to the absolute  part of Eq. (1) for 𝑚 = 𝑛 = 1 . In 
this work, we are speciﬁcally  interested  in the case that 𝑚 = 1 and 
𝑛 > 1 , i.e. when 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is a signal with central frequency  𝑓 𝑥 and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) is 
a faster oscillation  with the central frequency  𝑓 𝑦 = 𝑛𝑓 𝑥 . In this case, 
𝑐𝑜ℎ 1∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = |𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥 𝑛 , 𝑦 ) |, where 𝑥 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is built by multiply-  
ing the phase of 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) by 𝑛 , i.e. accelerating  𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) by a factor of 𝑛 . 
CFS as deﬁned  by Eq. (2) has a real value between  0 and 1, with 
0 corresponding  to the lack of any phase synchronization  between  two 
completely  independent  signals and 1 for two perfectly  synchronized  
time-series  with the same amplitude  envelope.  
2.2. Genuine  vs. spurious  interactions  
The PPS and CFS indices of Eqs. (1) and (2) have a bias based on the 
length of the data time-series,  i.e., two band-pass  ﬁltered  random  time- 
series also show a value larger than 0. Therefore,  a test of signiﬁcance  
is necessary  for phase synchronization  measures  ( Scheﬀer-Teixeira  and 
Tort, 2016 ) in order to distinguish  such spurious  interactions  when the 
data length is not suﬃcient.  
Another  type of spurious  interactions  (which is not statistically  dis- 
cernible  from real interactions)  is the interactions  due to the waveshape  
of brain signals.  The reason is that harmonic  components  of a signal with 
a non-sinusoidal  shape have CFS to each other. As an illustrative  exam- 
ple, Fig. 2 depicts a sawtooth-shaped  signal and its fundamental  and 
7th harmonic  components.  The 7th harmonic  of this sawtooth-shaped  
signal has an almost perfect 1:7 synchronization  to the fundamental  
frequency  ( 𝑐𝑜ℎ 1∶7 = 0 . 99 ). Additionally,  although  it is not the focus of 
this manuscript,  it is interesting  to note that when a non-sinusoidally  
shaped signal (here sawtooth-shaped)  is ﬁltered  in a wider frequency  
range around the harmonic  frequency,  PAC is observed  between  the har- 
monic and fundamental  frequencies  (in addition  to CFS). In this paper, 
however,  our focus is on the n:m synchronizations.

The example  of Fig. 2 shows that by band-pass  ﬁltering  a single 
process  one can observe  cross-frequency  coupling  between  its diﬀer- 
ent components,  although  these components  still represent  the same 
complex  signal. In the literature  of cross-frequency  coupling  ( Giehl 
et al., 2021; Hyaﬁl, 2017; Scheﬀer-Teixeira  and Tort, 2016; Siebenhüh-  
ner et al., 2020 ), such a coupling  between  the components  of a sin- 
gle process,  or generally  an interaction  between  two signals where at 
least one of them is a higher harmonic  of a non-sinusoidal  process  is 
called spurious  . This is usually  in contrast  to genuine  interactions  between  
two signals representing  two distinct  processes  where none of them is a 
higher harmonic  of a periodic  signal. Formally,  let 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑
𝑖 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) ( 𝑡 ) and 
𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑
𝑖 𝑦 ( 𝑖 ) ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑖 ∈ℕ be two n:m synchronized  periodic  oscillatory  pro- 
cesses, where 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑖 ) are the 𝑖 th harmonic  components  of 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 
𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) , respectively.  The fundamental  components  ( 𝑥 (1) and 𝑦 (1) ) and higher 
harmonics  ( 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑖 ) for 𝑖 ≥ 2 ) of each of these signals can be separated  
from each other by band-pass  ﬁltering  𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) . The synchronization  
of 𝑥 and 𝑦 implies  that for any 𝑖 1 , 𝑖 2 ∈ℕ , 𝑥 ( 𝑖 1 ) ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑖 2 ) ( 𝑡 ) are within-  
or cross-frequency  synchronized.  When assessing  the synchronization  of 
the narrow-band  signals,  we consider  only the synchronization  of funda- 
mental components  𝑥 (1) and 𝑦 (1) genuine.  The synchronization  of 𝑥 ( 𝑖 1 ) ( 𝑡 ) 
and 𝑦 ( 𝑖 2 ) ( 𝑡 ) for 𝑖 1 > 1 or 𝑖 2 > 1 is harmonic-driven  and is called spurious.  
Note that this does not mean that the signal components  are not syn- 
chronized  and the synchronization  value is non-zero  because  of insuf- 
ﬁcient number  of data points or due to ﬁltering.  By spurious  interac-  
tions due to waveshape  it is meant that any coupling  including  higher 
harmonics  is in fact mediated  by the fundamental  component  of the re- 
spective  non-sinusoidal  signal. Fig. 1 illustrates  the possible  within-  and 
cross-frequency  spurious  synchronizations  due to waveshape.  In the next 
section we introduce  an original  signal processing  method  for suppress-  
ing the harmonic-driven  synchronizations  in connectivity  analyses  using 
electrophysiological  data. 
A ﬁnal important  note is that, as discussed  in Kramer  et al. (2008) , 
a non-sinusoidal  signal can be constructed  from the mixing of distinct  
sources  with CFS or PAC. This is actually  a major concern  in electro-  
physiological  research  even outside  of connectivity  topic. Although  we 
do not account  for this issue in our analyses  explicitly,  we discuss it in 
Section  4.5 , “Harmoni  and signal mixing ”.

comes (for a review,  see Mezulis  et al., 2004 ). This bias often occurs in an 
ambiguous  interpersonal  context  without  clear feedback  for individual  
performance  ( Deﬀains  et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2017 ) because  of unclear  
personal  responsibility  when the link between  identity  and event is miss- 
ing ( Schlenker  et al., 1994 ). For instance,  ambiguity  has been shown to 
increase  self-serving  assessments  of ability ( Dunning  et al., 1989 ) and 
self-serving  allocation  ( Haisley  and Weber, 2010 ; Rodriguez-Lara  and 
Moreno-Garrido,  2012 ). In a coordination  task, it is relatively  diﬃcult  
to provide  precise feedback  for individual  performance.  Thus, the sec- 
ond possibility  is that coordinative  cooperation  leads to self-serving  bias 
and selﬁsh reward allocation.  
To better analyze  the tendency  for prosocial  or self-serving  behavior,  
we measured  individuals’  acknowledgment  of responsibility  after inter- 
personal  coordination.  In past studies of equity- and equality-based  dis- 
tribution  rules, individual  objective  contribution  (eﬀort)  was commonly  
manipulated  and calculated  to measure  how much reward distributors  
rely on this information  ( Bierhoﬀand  Rohmann,  2011 ; Cappelen  et al., 
2014 ). However,  we proposed  that the responsibility  attribution,  i.e. 
subjective  rating of individual  contributions,  matters  more especially  in 
an ambiguous  condition  where feedback  regarding  one’s contribution  is 
unclear.  Our previous  study showed  that subjective  rating of responsibil-  
ity was distinct  from objective  contribution  and inﬂuenced  certain par- 
ticipants’  behavioral  adjustment  in cooperation  ( Li et al., 2018 ). Another  
study also demonstrated  that concern  about individual  responsibility  in- 
ﬂuences  fairness  during reward redistribution  ( Cappelen  et al., 2010 ). 
Therefore,  we measured  responsibility  attribution  in the present  study 
and predicted  that it would play an important  mediation  role between  
task-related  psychological  activities  and decision-making  in resource  al- 
location.  
We further focused  on the related neural mechanisms  underlying  
the eﬀect of interpersonal  coordination  on reward distribution.  Given 
the interactive  nature of interpersonal  coordination,  it is imperative  to 
adopt the hyperscanning  technique  (i.e., the measurement  of brain ac- 
tivity from two or more individuals  simultaneously)  ( Babiloni  and As- 
tolﬁ, 2014 ; Czeszumski  et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile,  due to its mobility,  
relatively  low cost, and suitable  temporal  and spatial resolution,  recent 
hyperscanning  studies have used functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy  
(fNIRS)  to investigate  interpersonal  brain synchronization  (IBS) dur- 
ing social coordination  ( Amyot et al., 2020 ; Ferrari,  and Quaresima,  
2012 ; Tak and Ye, 2014 ; Tak et al., 2016 ). For instance,  increasing  
IBS has been reported  in various  coordinative  tasks such as coopera-  
tive singing/humming  ( Osaka et al., 2014 , 2015 ) and coordinated  group 
walking  ( Ikeda et al., 2017 ). Taking advantage  of the fNIRS hyperscan-  
ning technique,  we measured  IBS data as the neural index of how well 
two partners  coordinated  with each other during social interaction.  
The brain regions  of interest  were the right temporal–parietal  junc- 
tion (rTPJ) and the prefrontal  cortex, including  the dorsal medial pre- 
frontal cortex (DMPFC)  cortex, the frontopolar  and the dorsal lateral 
prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC).  These regions  were selected  due to their 
distinct  yet complementary  functions  in supporting  social coordina-  
tion; they frequently  have been investigated  simultaneously  ( Cui et al., 
2012 ; Gvirts and Perlmutter,  2020 ). Speciﬁcally,  the DMPFC,  fron- 
topolar  cortex and rTPJ are associated  with mentalization  (theory  of 
mind), mutual social attention  system,  and shared self-other  represen-  
tations that are essential  for cooperation  ( Cheng et al., 2015 ; Cui et al., 
2012 ; Czeszumski  et al., 2020 ; Decety and Lamm, 2007 ; Gvirts and 
Perlmutter,  2020 ; Liu et al., 2016 ). The DMPFC  cortex and rTPJ have 
shown increased  IBS during cooperation  experiments  compared  to con- 
trol conditions  ( Funane  et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2016 ; Mccabe  et al., 
2001 ; Miller et al., 2019 ; Nozawa  et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, the 
DLPFC is part of the executive  function  system and also plays an impor- 
tant role in top-down  control over cognitive  and emotional  processes  
( MacDonald  et al., 2000 ; Grossmann,  2013 ; Balconi  and Pagani,  2015 ). 
Enhanced  IBS of the DLPFC was also frequently  observed  in previous  
fNIRS-based  hyperscanning  studies ( Cheng et al., 2015 ; Reindl et al., 
2018 ). In light of the above, we wanted  to explore  how individuals  attribute  
responsibility  and distribute  rewards  after interpersonal  coordination.  In 
the current  study, participants  were asked to conduct  a time estimation  
task either synergistically  (the coordination  group) or solely (the control 
group) ( Hu et al., 2017 ) while their brain activities  were recorded  using 
fNIRS. We ﬁrst hypothesized  (hypothesis  1) that interpersonal  coordina-  
tion elicits higher levels of behavioral  coordination  and IBS across the 
two participants  in a dyad in the coordination  group compared  to the 
control group. Our second hypothesis  was that interpersonal  coordina-  
tion would inﬂuence  participants’  responsibility  attribution  and reward 
allocation.  Individuals  might perform  more prosocially  and be more in- 
clined to equalize  distribution  and promote  attribution  of shared respon-  
sibility during coordination;  alternatively,  interpersonal  coordination  
might lead an individual  to believe  that they will put more eﬀort into 
the task and, therefore,  would attribute  more responsibility  and allocate  
more reward towards  oneself.  This hypothesis  could be tested by deter- 
mining participants’  decision-making  after cooperation  (i.e., responsibil-  
ity attribution  and resource  allocation)  and its relationship  with IBS. Pre- 
vious studies have also found that IBS during interpersonal  coordination  
can predict subsequent  mutual helpfulness  and mediate  the prosocial  ef- 
fect of interpersonal  coordination  ( Hu et al., 2017 ). Thus, we used cor- 
relation  analysis,  mediation  analysis,  and multivariate  pattern  analysis  
(MVPA)  to explore  the correlation  between  behavioral  decision-making  
and univariate/multivariate  pattern  of neural synchronization.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
In total, 92 healthy  college students  (46 males and 46 females)  were 
recruited  as participants.  They were randomly  assigned  as 46 same- 
gender dyads, with 23 dyads in the coordination  group (age, mean 
± standard  deviation:  21.48 ± 1.91 years) and 23 dyads in the con- 
trol group (21.67 ± 2.06 years). Gender  and age were matched  be- 
tween the two groups (gender:  𝜒2 = 2.788, df = 1, p = 0.095; age: t 
[90] = -0.47, p = 0.64). The two participants  in a dyad did not know each 
other before the experiment.  All participants  were right-handed  and had 
a normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision, and none of them reported  a his- 
tory of neurological  or psychiatric  disorders.  Written  informed  consent  
was obtained  from each participant  before the experiment.  Participants  
were compensated  for their participation  (65–75 RMB yuan based on 
their performance  in the experiment).  The study was approved  by the 
Medical  Ethical Committee  of Shenzhen  University.  
2.2. Experimental  procedure  and tasks 
The two participants  were seated on opposite  sides of a table in 
a silent room, separated  by their computer  monitor  and keyboard  
( Fig. 1 A). All participants  wore headphones  to block keypress  sounds 
and to prevent  verbal or nonverbal  communication  with each other. For 
each dyad, participants  would ﬁrst have a 3 min resting-state  session 
for collecting  baseline  fNIRS data, during which they were required  to 
relax and stay motionless.  During the formal experimental  task session,  
participants  were required  to perform  a time estimation  task and re- 
port their responsibility  attribution  and resource  allocation  ( Fig. 1 B). 
The tasks were conducted  using the E-prime",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5441, 5444), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(8733, 8737), match='  3.'>"

dala, to the BNST ( Bienkowski  et al., 2018 ; Canteras  and Swan- 
son, 1992 ; Cullinan  et al., 1993 ; Dong et al., 2001 ; Herman  et al., 2020 ; 
Howell  et al., 1991 ; Kishi et al., 2000 ; McDonald  et al., 1999 ; Radley and 
Sawchenko,  2011 ; Shin et al., 2008 ; Swanson  and Cowan,  1977 ). 
In a key series of experiments,  Cullinan,  Herman,  and Wat- 
son (1993) used the anterograde  neuronal  tracer Phaseolus  vulgaris-  
leucoagglutinin  (PHA-L)  to reveal dense fornical  and amygdala/  stria 
terminalis  projections  of ventral subiculum  axons to the BNST in rats 
( Cullinan  et al., 1993 ). They further used a mix of anterograde  tracer 
PHA-L and retrograde  tracer Flouro-gold  to show that ventral subicu-  
lum neurons  project to cells within the BNST that in turn project to 
the PVN ( Cullinan  et al., 1993 ). The researchers  demonstrated  that this 
takes place via a polysynaptic  glucocorticoid  - GABAergic  feedback  in- 
hibition  system,  with the subiculum  stimulating  the BNST, which then 
sends inhibitory  signals to the PVN ( Cullinan  et al., 1993 ). Whilst it was 
previously  known that the subiculum  is involved  in top-down  regulation  
of the HPA-axis  (e.g., Jacobson  and Sapolsky,  1991 ), this study demon-  
strated that the ventral subiculum  largely relies on the BNST as an inter- 
mediary  structure  to do so. These ﬁndings,  and others since, have seen 
the BNST come to be understood  as an important  relay, or cortical  pro- 
cessing hub ( Radley and Johnson,  2018 ), integrating  information  from 
the hippocampus  and other regions  ( Radley and Sawchenko,  2011 ) be- 
fore regulating  HPA axis activity  ( Cullinan  et al., 1993 ; Herman  et al., 
2020 ; Lebow and Chen, 2016 ). Research  in rats suggest  a speciﬁc  role 
of the ventral subiculum  –BNST  pathway  in response  to acute stressors  
involving  exteroceptive  triggers  (e.g., stimuli connected  with novel en- 
vironments),  but not interoceptive  cues (e.g., hypoxia)  ( Herman  et al., 
1998 , 2020 ; Mueller  et al., 2004 ; Radley and Sawchenko,  2011 ). How- 
ever, the precise intricacies  of how this pathway  is related to the stress 
response  is likely to be complicated  by the heterogenous  and complex  
structure  of the BNST, with researchers  demonstrating  sometimes  oppos- 
ing functions  of diﬀerent  BNST sub-regions  on the PVN (Choi, Evanson,  
et al., 2008; Choi, Furay, et al., 2008; Herman  et al., 2020 ; Myers et al., 
2012). 
1.2. Subiculum–BNST  connectivity  in monkeys  
Subiculum-BNST  connectivity  in monkeys  has been far less exten- 
sively studied.  Probably  the ﬁrst indications  of a corresponding  con- 
nection  in monkeys  were published  in studies that used a mix of elec- 
trical stimulation  and lesion-degeneration  methods  to investigate  hip- 
pocampal  outputs  in squirrel  monkeys  ( Poletti et al., 1973 ; Poletti and 
Creswell,  1977 ; Poletti and Sujatanond,  1980 ). This research  uncovered  
evidence  for a light subiculum  connection  to the BNST ( Poletti et al., 
1973 ; Poletti and Creswell,  1977 ; Poletti and Sujatanond,  1980 ). In 
agreement  with subsequent  work in the rat (e.g., Cullinan  et al., 1993 ) 
Poletti and colleagues  also reported  that hippocampal-BNST  connectiv-  
ity was not completely  reliant on the fornix, but rather that the BNST 
receives  additional  anterior  hippocampal  (corresponding  to ventral hip- 
pocampus  in rodents,  Strange  et al., 2014 ) inﬂuences;  likely involving  
the stria terminalis  and/or the amygdalofugal  pathway  ( Morrison  and 
Poletti,  1980 ; Poletti et al., 1973 ; Poletti and Creswell,  1977 ; Poletti and 
Sujatanond,  1980 ). More recently,  a ventral subiculum  connection  to the 
BNST has also been reported  in the primate-like  tree shrew ( Ni et al., 
2016 ).

using Method A. 
and contrast,  is often directly  referred  to as the water content  of tissue; 
however,  the often-employed  notation,  PD, refers only to the density  of 
free protons  in tissue water but does not include  the MR-invisible  bound 
protons  (such as protons  bound to macromolecules).  Usually,  water con- 
tent of tissue is expressed  in percentage  units ( Bloembergen,  1948 ) as 
the percentage  of the water concentration  in tissue with respect to pure 
water. In human white matter,  for example,  this is approximately  70% 
( Shah et al., 2001 ; Steinhoﬀ et  al., 2001 ; Tofts, 2003 ). By employing  
MR sequences  with short echo times (TE) and long repetition  times 
(TR), the MR-visible  proton density  can be measured  since it is directly  
proportional  to the measured  MR signal strength.  When the dominant  
contribution  of the MR signal intensity  is due to the protons  in water 
molecules,  the proportionality  can be used to quantify  the absolute  wa- 
ter content  in tissue if hardware  imperfections  have been properly  cor- 
rected ( Neeb and Shah, 2006 ; Tofts, 2003 ). 
In recent years, novel quantitative  MRI (qMRI)  approaches  have 
gained attention,  and, especially  for human brain imaging,  qMRI is an 
attractive  methodology  to study pathological  changes  in the brain. Com- 
pared to conventional  qualitative  (i.e. non-quantitative)  MRI, qMRI pro- 
vides an unbiased  measurement  method  and allows for more straightfor-  
ward statistical  modelling.  By applying  qMRI correctly,  large national  or 
even international  multi-centre  studies can be more directly  compared.  
Furthermore,  longitudinal  studies for the precise evaluation  of disease  
progression  and monitoring  become  more amenable.  In particular,  de- 
generative  and chronic  diseases  such as multiple  sclerosis  (MS), which 
has an onset in the early age ranges of life, can be much more accu- 
rately monitored  and investigated  in order to better understand,  e.g., 
the correlation  of lesion burden and physical  disabilities,  and especially  
long-term  lesion behaviour  and lesion diﬀerentiation.  Quantitative  mea- 
sures of relaxation  parameters,  such as T 1 and/or T 2 , as well as free 
water content,  could provide  a good basis for the detection  of cerebral  
abnormalities  in many diseases.  Potentially,  earlier detection  might be 
facilitated  using qMRI rather than with standard  imaging  methods,  as many signiﬁcant  confounding  eﬀects aﬄicting  conventional  approaches  
are explicitly  corrected  in qMRI ( Tofts, 2003 ). 
More recently,  qMRI, focussing  on water content  measurements,  
has been used to investigate  several pathologies,  including  hepatic  en- 
cephalopathy  ( Shah et al., 2008 ), tumour-generated  oedema  ( Oros- 
Peusquens  et al., 2014 ) and chronic  kidney disease  and haemodialysis  
( Reetz et al., 2015 ). Initial successful  investigations  using lower ﬁelds 
(1.5T) resulted  in a signiﬁcant  amount  of work ( Neeb and Shah, 2006 ; 
Neeb et al., 2006a , b; Neeb, 2004 ; Shah et al., 2008 ) to overcome  the 
failure of the reciprocity  principle  observed  at higher ﬁelds, i.e., at 3T 
( Abbas et al., 2014 ; Abbas et al., 2015 ; Gras et al., 2013 ; Volz et al., 
2012a ) and above. More recently,  work by Oros-Peusquens  et al. ( Oros- 
Peusquens  et al., 2019 ) and Abbas et al. ( Abbas et al., 2014 ) has shown 
how inhomogeneities  arising from the coil sensitivity  can be overcome.  
This facilitates  quantitative  water content  measurement  in the brain 
with a high contrast-to-noise  (CNR) ratio, whilst maintaining  accuracy  
even at 3T ( Abbas et al., 2015 ). Considering  recent progress  in qMRI, it 
is all the more surprising  to note the complete  absence  of quantitative  
water content  atlases;  in this work, this omission  is addressed.  
In order to demonstrate  the strengths  of tissue water content  atlas, se- 
lected patient cases are presented,  illustrating  diﬀerent  diseases,  which 
are known to lead to changes  in the water content  of the brain. The 
work herein describes  the development  of a quantitative  water content  
brain atlas and its voxel-based  comparison  to the water content  maps of 
a circumscribed  number  of patients;  a full study of lesion water content  
in these patients  is ongoing  and is outside  the scope of this manuscript.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
All measurements  were carried out on a 3 T Siemens  Magnetom  
Tim-Trio  scanner  (Siemens  Healthineers,  Erlangen,  Germany)  using a 
2  N.J. Shah, Z. Abbas, D. Ridder et al. NeuroImage  252 (2022) 119014

for water content imaging  using Method B. 
multi-slice,  multi-echo  RF-spoiled  gradient-echo  (GRE) sequence.  Ra- 
diofrequency  (RF) excitation  was achieved  using the body coil, and a 
32-channel  phased-array  receive  head coil, as provided  by the manu- 
facturer,  was used for signal reception.  The study was approved  by the 
local ethics committee  and was conducted  according  to the declaration  
of Helsinki.  
2.1.1. Healthy  volunteers  
Twenty  right-handed,  healthy  male subjects  (age 25.3 ± 2.5 years, 
age range 21.3 to 29.5 years) were recruited  for the study. Each partici-  
pant completed  a screening  questionnaire  prior to the MR examination.  
Excessive  alcohol  or tobacco  consumption  and neurological  disorders  
were criteria  for rejection.  This study was performed  with the approval  
of the local ethics committee,  and all participants  gave prior, informed  
consent  in writing.  
2.1.2. Patients  
Patients  suﬀering  from stroke (male, age 82 years), brain tumour  
(glioblastoma,  male, 32 years) or multiple  sclerosis  (male, 38 years) 
went through  similar imaging  protocols  as the healthy  volunteers.  
2.2. MRI data acquisition  
Quantitative  cerebral  water content  was measured  using recently  
validated  methods  ( Abbas et al., 2014 ; Abbas et al., 2015 ; Oros- 
Peusquens  et al., 2014 Oros-Peusquens  et al., 2019 ). MR-visible  proton 
density  was estimated  ( Abbas et al., 2014 ; Abbas et al., 2015 ; Gras et al., 
2013 ; Neeb and Shah, 2006 ; Neeb et al., 2006b ; Shah et al., 2008 ) to 
reﬂect the free water content  (FW) present  in the tissue ( Tofts, 2003 ), 
and image acquisition  was performed  using two methods:  intermediate  
TR method  (Method  A) and long TR method  (Method  B). The two meth- 
ods were used and their atlases compared  in order to demonstrate  the 
generality  of the quantitative  water content  atlas. 
The data analysis  steps for protocols  A and B are schematically  de- 
picted in Figures  1 and 2 , and a detailed  description  of the sequences,  
acquisition  parameters  and estimation  of water content  is provided  in 
Table 1 and in Appendix  A . All healthy  subjects  were examined  with the aforementioned  quan- 
titative  imaging  protocols  using the following  parameters:  
• (Method  A) Intermediate  TR Method  64 slices; 1 mm in-plane  reso- 
lution; 2 mm slice thickness  (slice gap free acquisition);  acquisition  
time = 13:50 minutes.  
• (Method  B) Long TR Method  57 slices; 1.04 mm in-plane  resolution;  
1.50 mm slice thickness  (1mm slice gap); acquisition  time = 7:30 
minutes.  
Following  the water content  protocol,  a high-resolution  1 mm 
isotropic  T 1 -weighted  image was obtained  using a magnetisation-  
prepared  rapid gradient-echo  sequence  (MPRAGE)  to facilitate  the trans- 
formation  of the quantitative  data into MNI space.

large volumetric  reconstructions  of ex vivo human brain tissue ( Magnain  
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018a ). The resulting  reduced  speckle  contrast  
was inversely  proportional  to the square root of the number  of images 
used to average.  However,  this type of speckle  reduction  method  suﬀers 
from substantially  increased  acquisition  time. For example,  acquiring  
50% overlapped  data takes four times longer than acquiring  non-overlap  
data. 
Several  post processing  tools that apply denoising  algorithms  to the 
acquired  OCT data have been developed.  The high-contrast  appearance  
of speckle  has led to the usage of ﬁltering-based  methods  ( Bernstein,  
1987; Frost et al., 1982; Lee, 1980; Ramos-Llordén  et al., 2015; Sali- 
nas and Fernandez,  2007; Yu and Acton, 2002 ) to remove  speckle.  Fil- 
tering methods  generally  work well in homogeneous  regions  but can 
distort tissue boundaries  and blur structures,  reducing  the eﬀective  res- 
olution  of the image. Another  class of denoising  methods  include  ad- 
ditive noise removal  methods  applied  to the logarithm  of the OCT im- 
age. These methods  are based on the assumption  that, with averaging,  
the speckle  distribution  of log-transformed  OCT intensity  images ap- 
proaches  the Gaussian  distribution  ( Xie et al., 2002 ). State of the art 
log transformation  based denoising  methods  include  non-local  means 
(NLM) ( Aum et al., 2015; Buades et al., 2010; Coupéet  al., 2009; Fischl 
and Schwartz,  1999; Yu et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020 ), block matching  
3D (BM3D)  ( Dabov et al., 2007 ), wavelet  shrinkage  denoising  ( Chong 
and Zhu, 2013; Mayer et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2017 ) and constrained  
optimization  (e.g. total variation  constraint)  methods  ( Fang et al., 2012; 
Feng et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018b; Wong et al., 
2010 ). One drawback  of these approaches  is that most of them assume  
zero mean noise, which does not hold for the log transformed  speckle  
distribution,  leading  to a mean bias in the denoised  result ( Arsenault  
and April, 1976; Gong et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2002 ). 
The advent of deep learning  technology  has also resulted  in a number  
of promising  learning  based denoising  methods.  While these denoising  
methods  have largely focused  on removing  additive  noise, there is re- 
cent work in removing  speckle  in both supervised  ( Akter et al., 2020; 
Devalla  et al., 2019; Menon et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020 ) and unsuper-  
vised manner  ( Huang et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2019 ) from OCT images.  
The supervised  learning  techniques  rely on ﬁnding  the mapping  between  
averaged  ground  truth and noisy data. The unsupervised  methods  uti- 
lize noise2noise  approach  ( Krull et al., 2018; Lehtinen  et al., 2018 ) that 
trains on paired sets of noisy images.  However,  the generalizability  of 
these methods  remains  untested  for human brain imaging  that diﬀers in 
tissue contrast  (signal intensities),  image features,  imaging  resolutions,  
and signal to noise ratio. We are also limited in training  these methods  
for human brain OCT due to the lack of available  training  data. 
The ﬁnal class of denoising  methods  remove  multiplicative  noise by 
optimizing  a speckle  distribution  model. Speckle  has been shown to be 
gamma  distributed  on OCT intensity  images ( Feng et al., 2014; Gong 
et al., 2015; Kirillin et al., 2014 ). Speckle  in uniform  media is modeled  
by the negative  exponential  distribution,  a special case of the gamma  
distribution  ( Goodman,  1975 ). The speckle  distribution  of OCT ampli- 
tude, which is the square root of measured  OCT intensity,  is modeled  
by Rayleigh  or Nakagami  distributions  ( Karamata  et al., 2005; Pircher  
et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2013 ), which are related to the square-root  of the 
gamma  distribution.  OCT studies have also reported  high goodness  of ﬁt 
for the generalized  gamma  distribution  in applications  such as cornea 
and skin imaging  ( Farhat et al., 2011; Jesus and Iskander,  2017; Raju 
and Srinivasan,  2002 ). While the gamma  speckle  model ﬁts OCT data 
well, it is complicated  and non-trivial  to optimize.  Log transformed  de- 
noising  and the BM3D algorithm  have been extended  to use the gamma  
distributed  multiplicative  speckle  noise model to denoise  synthetic  aper- 
ture radar (SAR) images ( Bioucas-Dias  and Figueiredo,  2010; Parrilli 
et al., 2012 ). 
In this study we propose  a new approach  to optimize  the gamma  dis- 
tribution  speckle  model and remove  multiplicative  speckle  noise from 
OCT images of ex vivo human brain tissue. The proposed  method  min- 
imizes the negative  log likelihood  (NLL) of the gamma  distribution  pe- nalized  with a spatial regularization  constraint.  We provide  novel theo- 
retical understanding  into the convexity  of diﬀerent  terms forming  the 
gamma  NLL cost. We take advantage  of this new insight to propose  a 
majorize-minimize  framework  ( Hunter and Lange, 2004; de Leeuw and 
Heiser, 1977 ) based method  that optimizes  the complicated  cost func- 
tion using simpler  surrogate  functions.  The proposed  minimization  re- 
duces to solving  an iterative  regularized  least squares  problem,  which 
decreases  the computation  time compared  to the existing  NLM state of 
the art methods.  We compare  the performance  of our technique  with 
ﬁltering  methods,  log-normal  approximation  method,  NLM and SAR 
BM3D, and demonstrate  the improvement  in overall denoising  accu- 
racy, CNR between  tissue types and in preservation  of small features  
and edges of human brain tissue. We also demonstrate  the generaliz-  
ability of our approach  in removing  speckle  across multiple  tissue types 
and multiple  imaging  resolution  scales, and its ﬂexibility  to work with 
convex regularization  functions.  
The work is organized  as follows:  we brieﬂy describe  the back- 
ground  on speckle  likelihood,  derive the proposed  algorithm  called MM- 
despeckle,  demonstrate  speckle  removal  results,  discuss implications  of 
our approach  and present  the conclusions.  
2. Background  
2.1. Speckle distribution  in OCT images 
Speckle  noise in OCT intensity  images ( Goodman,  1976 ) is a form of 
multiplicative  noise that is well described  at an arbitrary  voxel as 
𝑦 2 = 𝑥 2 ⋅𝑠, (1) 
where 𝑦 is the measured  OCT amplitude  and its square is the mea- 
sured OCT intensity,  𝑥 is the true OCT amplitude  and 𝑠 is the speckle  
noise corrupting  the OCT intensity  (i.e. the squared  amplitude).  The 
probability  density  function  (PDF) describing  the spatial distribution  of 
speckle  noise in OCT intensity  data is modeled  with a gamma  distribu-  
tion ( 𝑝 𝑠 ( 𝑠 ; 𝛼, 𝛽)) ( Feng et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2015; Goodman,  1975; 
Kirillin et al., 2014 ): 
𝑝 𝑠 ( 𝑠 ; 𝛼, 𝛽) = 𝛽𝛼
Γ( 𝛼) 𝑠 𝛼−1 exp ( − 𝛽𝑠 ) , (2) 
with 𝑠 > 0 , 𝛼> 0 and 𝛽> 0 . Here Γ( ⋅) is the gamma  function,  𝛼is the 
shape parameter  and 𝛽is the rate parameter  of the gamma  distribution.  
2.2. Maximum  likelihood  estimation  (MLE) for denoising  
MLE is a commonly  used procedure  to denoise  data. The main as- 
sumption  for MLE methods  is that we can model the likelihood  distri- 
bution 𝑝 ( 𝑦 |𝑥 ) of the acquired  data. MLE methods  ﬁnd an estimate  ̂𝑥 of 
the true signal 𝑥 from the measured  data 𝑦 by maximizing  the likeli- 
hood distribution.  This is generally  achieved  by minimizing  a penalized  
negative  log likelihood  (P-NLL)  cost function  
̂𝑥 = arg min 
𝑥 − log ( 𝑝 ( 𝑦 |𝑥 ) ) + 𝜆𝑅 ( 𝑥 ) , (3) 
where 𝑅 ( 𝑥 ) is a regularization  or penalty  function  and 𝜆is the regular-  
ization parameter.  The penalty  is put in place to constrain  the generally  
ill-posed  nature of the negative  log likelihood  minimization.

Just as there are cortical  connections,  there is also connectivity  
between  subcortical  structures  (e.g. the thalamus  and basal ganglia),  
forming  the subcortical  connections,  which can also be referred  to as 
subcortico-subcortical  connections.  These subcortical  structures  are im- 
portant  to motor control ( Gallay et al., 2008 ; Sommer,  2003 ), as well 
as cognition  and emotion  ( Hollander  et al., 2015 ). Accordingly,  con- 
nections  between  the subcortical  structures  are integral  and have been 
studied  extensively  in non-human  primate  (NHP) studies of the motor 
network  ( DeLong  and Wichmann,  2007 ; Gallay et al., 2008 ; Krack et al., 
2010 ), as well as associative  and limbic networks  ( Alexander  et al., 
1986 ; Krack et al., 2010 ; Middleton  and Strick, 2000 ; Smith et al., 1998 ). 
Previous  studies have examined  subcortical  connections  with the use of 
anatomical  tracers,  which involve  injection  of either anterograde  or ret- 
rograde  tracers at a structure  of interest  to map its connections.  One 
such example  involved  the injection  of an anatomical  tracer at the ven- 
tral pallidum,  which determined  projections  to the subthalamic  nucleus  
(STN), as well as the hypothalamus  and brainstem  ( Haber et al., 1993 ), 
Studies  that attempt  to more comprehensively  identify  the subcor-  
tical connections  non-invasively  via tractography,  that is to map the 
subcortical  connectome  , have been limited.  The scarcity  of subcortical  
connectome  studies is in part due to the diﬃculty  of tracking  the connec-  
tions in a compact  region where the underlying  diﬀusion  signal is com- 
plicated  by multiple  diﬀusion  orientations  arising from numerous  inter- 
secting connections  and structures  with low anisotropy.  One previous  
study demonstrated  the ability to map connections  between  the basal 
ganglia  and thalamus  in vivo using manual  segmentations  before lever- 
aging connectivity  strength  to parcellate  the basal ganglia  and thalamus  
into subregions  ( Lenglet  et al., 2012 ). Recently,  in vivo studies have pri- 
marily focused  on individual  connections  that comprise  speciﬁc  subcor-  
tical connections  and have been identiﬁed  as putative  targets for surgical  
neuromodulation  ( Avecillas-Chasin  and Honey,  2020 ; Rozanski  et al., 
2017 ). In one study, the pallidothalamic  tract was delineated  in order 
to study its role in the treatment  of dystonia  with deep brain stimulation  
(DBS; Rozanski  et al., 2017 ), while another  study examined  the impor- 
tance of pallidoputaminal  connectivity  to predict DBS outcomes  also for 
dystonia  ( Raghu et al., 2021 ). With the aid of a number  of atlas-based  
inclusion  and exclusion  ROIs, as well as extensive  manual  reﬁnement,  
tractography  has been used to identify  the nigrofugal  and pallidofugal  
subcortical  connections.  ( Avecillas-Chasin  and Honey,  2020 ). Recently,  
an attempt  was made to map subthalamic  tracts using ex vivo data, using 
ROIs to guide and identify  speciﬁc  subcortical  connections  ( Oishi et al., 
2020 ). All of these studies employed  tractography  to identify  the tra- 
jectory of the connections  using non-invasive  techniques,  highlighting  a 
potential  for tractography-guided  treatment.  Reliable  and accurate  iden- 
tiﬁcation  of these connections  has the potential  to improve  diagnosis  
and treatment  options.  
With reliability  studies having been previously  performed  in trac- 
tography  studies of cortical  connectivity  (including,  but not limited to 
Buchanan  et al., 2014 ; Cousineau  et al., 2017 ; Guevara  et al., 2017 ; 
Schilling  et al., 2021 ), an evaluation  of the reliability  of the subcor-  
tical connectome  is also warranted.  Despite  examination  of individual  
subcortical  connections,  to our knowledge,  there has yet to be a study 
assessing  the reliability  of the subcortical  connectome.  Brieﬂy,  reliabil-  
ity is deﬁned  as the agreement  of the results (e.g. similar connectiv-  
ity) when applying  the same methodology  to diﬀerent  acquisitions  of 
the same subject or to data acquired  from diﬀerent  subjects.  Not to be 
confused  with reproducibility,  another  term that often gets used inter- 
changeably,  which is deﬁned  as the ability to produce  similar results 
when using an entirely  diﬀerent  methodology.  Both are important  and 
can provide  valuable  insight regarding  a method  or result. Reliability  
studies can evaluate  and increase  the conﬁdence  of methodological  ap- 
proaches  used to study structural  connectivity,  while reproducibility  
studies can validate  ﬁndings  by comparing  results produced  with other 
techniques.  In this work, we recapitulate  pathways  of the subcortical  
connectome  in the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) test-retest  dataset.  
We aimed to assess the feasibility  and reliability  of mapping  the subcor-  tical connectome,  with a speciﬁc  goal of recapitulating  known connec-  
tions, through  application  of subcortical  structure  segmentations  and 
probabilistic  tractography.  Furthermore,  we sought to develop  a frame- 
work that enabled  evaluation  of reliability  for the subcortical  connec-  
tome moving  forward.  Additional  validation  was performed  using the 
unrelated  subjects  dataset of the HCP. 
2. Materials  and methods  
Processing  of the data was performed  in containerized  computing  
environments  on a high performance  compute  cluster.  An overview  
of the general  workﬂow  is shown in Fig. 1 . Brieﬂy,  publicly  available  
minimally  pre-processed  test-retest  data from the Human  Connectome  
Project was used to assess reliability  of connections  (identiﬁed  via trac- 
tography)  between  subcortical  structures  and feasibility  of identifying  
connections  of known subcortical  circuits.  Analysis  included  evaluat-  
ing tract overlap,  changes  in tract density,  and examining  identiﬁed  
connections  with trajectories  previously  described  in the literature.  Fur- 
thermore,  processing  and analysis  was replicated  on an unrelated  subset 
from the Human  Connectome  Project.  
2.1. Dataset 
Minimally  pre-processed  subjects  as part of the test-retest  dataset 
(n = 36; 11M/25F,  aged 22-35) of the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ) were used to assess the relia- 
bility of subcortical  connections  identiﬁed  via tractography.  Brieﬂy,  T1- 
weighted  (T1w) MRI scans were acquired  with a 3D MPRAGE  sequence  
( Mugler and Brookeman,  1990 ): resolution  = 0.7 mm isotropic  voxels; 
repetition  time/echo  time (TR/TE)  = 2400 / 2.14 ms, while dMRI scans 
were acquired  in opposite  anterior-posterior  phase-encoding  directions  
with a pulsed gradient  spin-echo  sequence  ( Stejskal  and Tanner,  1965 ): 
resolution  = 1.25 mm isotropic  voxels; TR/TE = 5520 / 89.50 ms; b- 
values = 1000, 2000, 3000 s/mm 2 (90 directions  per shell) with 18 b- 
value = 0 s/mm 2 images.  All data was acquired  on customized  Siemens  
Skyra 3T MRI systems  ( Sotiropoulos  et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2012 ). 
Full acquisition  details are described  in the HCP1200  reference  man- 
ual 1 . As part of the minimal  pre-processing  pipeline  data release,  all sub- 
jects underwent  FreeSurfer  processing  (v5.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5443, 5446), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(7659, 7661), match='3.'>"

Although  interrupted  or “gated ”speech  (i.e., speech which is inter- 
rupted by intervals  of silence)  results in incomplete  speech segments,  
it can still be surprisingly  easy to understand  as long as a listener  has 
normal  hearing  acuity. In certain circumstances,  it is possible  to un- 
derstand  nearly all of a speech signal of which 50% has been replaced  
by silence ( Gilbert et al., 2007; Miller and Licklider,  1950 ). Wang and 
Humes (2010) investigated  the inﬂuence  of three parameters  on inter- 
rupted speech understanding.  These were on-duration  (i.e., the absolute  
duration  of the sound intervals),  duty cycle (i.e., the relative  duration  
of speech within each interruption  cycle) and interruption  rate (IR; the 
number  of interruptions  per second).  They found that duty cycle pri- 
marily determined  performance,  but both IR and on-duration  modiﬁed  
performance  as well. Keeping  the on-duration  ﬁxed, a higher IR results 
in a higher number  of glimpses  at the original  signal. Understanding  
typically  declines  sharply  when the IR becomes  lower than the average  
syllabic  rate of speech ( ∼5 Hz; Bologna  et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2017 ). 
Other factors that inﬂuence  the understanding  of interrupted  speech are 
the presence  of contextual  (e.g., lexical or syntactic)  information  and the 
fundamental  frequency  of the speaker  ( Wang and Humes,  2010; Wing- 
ﬁeld et al., 1991 ). 
In their seminal  study, Gordon-Salant  and Fitzgibbons  (1993) com- 
pared younger  and older adults in interrupted  speech understanding  
while including  participants  with clinically  relevant  peripheral  hearing  
loss in each of the two age groups.  They showed  that both age and 
hearing  loss inﬂuenced  interrupted  speech understanding.  Similarly,  
in the study of Ba ş kent et al. (2010) , their data suggested  that older, 
more hearing-impaired  participants  showed  worse understanding  of in- 
terrupted  speech than younger  participants  with none or only a mild 
hearing  loss, although  this question  was not statistically  tested in the 
paper and the relation  of age and hearing  loss was not controlled  for re- 
garding  this particular  outcome  variable.  Shaﬁro  et al. (2016) also found 
a diﬀerence  in interrupted  speech understanding  between  younger  and 
older adults at IRs of 2 and 4 Hz. Taken together,  it seems that younger  
and older adults diﬀer on average  in their ability to understand  inter- 
rupted speech,  and that hearing  loss has an additional  detrimental  eﬀect. 
1.1. Cognitive  repair mechanisms:  domain-general?  
If there is a diﬀerence  in the percentage  of remaining  speech signal 
and understood  speech signal, one must assume  that some kind of repair 
of the missing  input has taken place. The concept  of repair mechanisms  
has been proposed  by Ba ş kent et al. (2010) and it is assumed  that these 
repair mechanisms  are somehow  related to cognitive  ability. Indeed,  the 
positive  inﬂuence  of repair mechanisms  associated  with cognitive  ability 
on speech understanding  in adverse  listening  situations  is a common  
research  ﬁnding  and is implied  in several empirically  grounded  models 
of eﬀortful  listening  ( Arlinger  et al., 2009; Pichora-Fuller  et al., 2016; 
Rönnberg  et al., 2013 ). In the Ease of Language  Understanding  (ELU) 
model ( Rönnberg  et al., 2013 ), the storage  and processing  aspects  of 
working  memory  enable phonological,  lexical,  and semantic  retrieval  
and pattern  matching,  which is important  when listening  to partially  
masked  speech.  The Framework  for Understanding  Eﬀortful  Listening  
( Pichora-Fuller  et al., 2016 ) underscores  the importance  of attention  
and how it governs  the allocation  of cognitive  capacity  to cope with 
listening  demand.  
The most common  test for the level of listening  demand,  or eﬀort- 
ful listening,  is the speech-in-noise  paradigm.  The paradigm  of inter- 
rupted speech is less frequently  employed  and therefore  the ﬁndings  on 
the inﬂuence  of cognition  on understanding  interrupted  speech are few. 
In a study by Benard et al. (2014) , receptive  vocabulary  predicted  un- 
derstanding  of speech interrupted  at a rate of 2.5 Hz in an age-diverse  
sample.  Bologna  et al. (2018) tested younger  and older participants  on 
understanding  interrupted  speech and additionally  administered  a cog- 
nitive test battery  encompassing  processing  speed, working  memory,  
inhibitory  control,  and visual linguistic  closure,  which is a measure  of 
the ability to infer written  language  that is presented  behind visual ob- structions  (see Zekveld  et al., 2007 ). Only processing  speed and visual 
linguistic  closure  predicted  understanding  of interrupted  speech,  both 
across age groups.  
The paradigm  of visual linguistic  closure  can be considered  a vi- 
sual analogue  of interrupted  speech.  As such, the relationship  be- 
tween visual linguistic  closure  and understanding  of interrupted  speech 
is particularly  interesting.  The ﬁnding  of such a relationship  by 
Bologna  et al. (2018) raises the question  of whether  cognitive  re- 
pair mechanisms  are rooted within the auditory  domain  or whether  
they draw upon a domain-general  cognitive  resource.  Indeed,  the ELU 
posits both a modality-speciﬁc  and a modality-independent  capacity  
( Rönnberg  et al., 2013 ). In our study, we continued  this line of thought  
and investigated  whether  there was a correlation  between  visual lin- 
guistic closure  and interrupted  speech understanding  as well as between  
visual linguistic  closure  and a measurement  of the neural tracking  of in- 
terrupted  speech.  A correlation  between  tests of interrupted  language  
understanding  in the auditory  and visual domains  would point to a 
domain-general  capacity,  and ﬁnding  that correlation  again between  
visual linguistic  closure  and neural speech tracking  would provide  evi- 
dence for neural speech tracking  being a candidate  mechanism  involved  
in the manifestation  of such a domain-general  capacity  in the auditory  
domain.  
1.2. Cortical  tracking  mechanisms  during speech processing  
Aging is associated  with the loss of ﬁne inner and outer hair cells in 
the cochlea.  This loss impairs  the ability to perceive  and discriminate  
sounds.  It is thus productive  to focus research  on central neural pro- 
cesses that support  the processing  of degraded  auditory  signals.  A better 
understanding  of how older adults’ brain activity  processes  incomplete  
speech signals will inform better interventions  for ARHL. In the current  
study, we aimed to investigate  the brain processes  that underlie  older 
adults’ understanding  of interrupted  sentences.  Speciﬁcally,  we investi-  
gated whether  neural tracking  of interrupted  speech would take place 
and if yes, whether  there was a statistical  relationship  between  the dif- 
ﬁculty of understanding  the interrupted  speech signal and the strength  
of neural speech tracking.  
The notion of an alignment  between  the speech signal and the 
neural activity  related to its processing  is not new. The TEMPO  
model ( Ghitza,  2011 ) as well as the later model by Giraud and Poep- 
pel (2012) posit a mechanism  by which intrinsic  cortical  oscillations  be- 
come synchronized  to the inherent,  quasi-rhythmic  properties  of speech 
( Peelle et al., 2013 ). This mechanism  has been called “entrainment  ”, and 
many following  studies have been dedicated  to elucidate  its importance  
for speech processing.  However,  it is very diﬃcult  to provide  actual ev- 
idence for an intrinsic  oscillator,  and many scientiﬁc  results that have 
been framed in an entrainment  context  can be equally  well explained  by 
superposition  of evoked  responses  ( Alexandrou  et al., 2020; Obleser  and 
Kayser,  2019 ). For this reason,  we refer to the alignment  of the neural 
response  to the speech signal in our study as “neural  speech tracking  ”, 
which is a more general  term and which does not assume  an intrinsic  
oscillator  as the underlying  source of the observed  neural activity.  
At the heart of this alignment  between  speech and neural oscillations  
is the notion of diﬀerent  time scales. It is presumed  that linguistic  fea- 
tures operating  on diﬀerent  time scales (e.g., prosody,  phrase structure,  
syllables,  phonemes)  are tracked  by functionally  distinct  components  of 
brain activity  ( “frequency  bands ”), which share the temporal  resolution  
of the corresponding  linguistic  units ( Ding et al., 2016; 2017; Giraud 
and Poeppel,  2012; Keitel et al., 2018; Poeppel,  2003 ). 
The reason why this mechanism  should take place is that an align- 
ment between  neural frequency-related  activity  and these speciﬁc  time 
scales in the speech signal optimizes  the ﬁring rate of neuronal  assem- 
blies in such a way that they are maximally  excitable  when there is an 
acoustic  signal to process,  and they recover  when there is less acoustic  
signal to process  ( Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ). The interrupted  speech 
paradigm  ﬁts particularly  well within this framework,  as one can make 
2  I. Kurthen, A. Christen, M. Meyer et al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119580 
sure that there are periods  in the speech signal which are ideally suited 
for neuronal  recovery  (i.e., the silent period).  
Neural speech tracking  is a robust phenomenon  and it exhibits  con- 
siderable  inter-individual  variability  ( Lam et al., 2018 ). Studies  employ-  
ing transcranial  alternating  current  stimulation  (tACS) have provided  
evidence  that neural speech tracking  is not simply an epiphenomenon  
of speech processing,  but that it serves a causal role ( Riecke et al., 2018; 
Wilsch et al., 2018; Zoefel et al., 2018 ). In these studies,  an electric  al- 
ternating  current  signal was applied  to participants’  brains while they 
performed  speech-related  tasks. The frequency  of the alternating  current  
carried information  about the temporal  envelope  of the speech stimuli 
presented.  In all three studies,  participants’  task performance  signiﬁ- 
cantly diﬀered  with regard to the phase angle of the alternating  cur- 
rent that was used for stimulation.  While these results are intriguing,  
the spatial resolution  of tACS is limited ( Yang et al., 2021 ) and it is un- 
clear where exactly in the brain the stimulation  takes eﬀect ( Obleser  and 
Kayser,  2019 ). 
A current  question  is whether  neural speech tracking  changes  in ad- 
verse listening  situations  and, if yes, whether  it changes  in a qualitative  
or in a quantitative  way. Haegens  and Zion Golumbic  (2018) conclude  
that neural speech tracking  is primarily  initiated  by automatic,  bottom-  
up processes,  but that it can be modulated  by top-down  control (see also 
Lakatos  et al., 2016; 2019; Park et al., 2015; Petersen  et al., 2017 ). Be- 
cause ARHL alters the encoding  of the speech signal in the brainstem  
( Anderson  et al., 2013; Bidelman  et al., 2019; 2014 ), which then serves 
as the basis for acoustic  analyses  in the auditory  cortex, it is important  to 
investigate  mechanisms  that optimize  processing  of the auditory  input. 
If neural speech tracking  is indeed causally  related to speech decoding,  
the most obvious  mechanism  to enhance  decoding  would be to increase  
speech tracking.  Research  shows that the relationship  is not that sim- 
ple. Petersen  et al. (2017) found that better hearing  thresholds  were 
not related to increased  speech tracking,  but to decreased  tracking  of a 
competing  speech signal, which had to be ignored.  A recent study by 
Presacco  et al. (2019) found that hearing  loss modulated  neither  speech 
tracking  at the midbrain  nor at the cortical  level, but instead  modulated  
the reciprocal  connections  between  lower and higher levels of the audi- 
tory pathway.  
These results,  however,  were all obtained  using a speech-in-noise  
paradigm.  As an alternative,  interrupted  speech is an interesting  test 
case for speech tracking  for several reasons.  An adverse  listening  condi- 
tion may not always arise from noise continuously  masking  speech,  but 
also from noise interrupting  speech at intervals,  like during an unstable  
telephone  connection.  Interrupted  speech rather than speech-in-noise  is 
a better model of such a situation.  Additionally,  whenever  the speech 
signal is resumed  after a period of silence,  sharp edges in the signal are 
created.  These sharp edges are hypothesized  to trigger phase resets of 
ongoing  neural oscillations  ( Doelling  et al., 2014; Giraud and Poeppel,  
2012; Lakatos  et al., 2019 ), and thereby  induce an “entrainment  ”of said 
ongoing  neural oscillations  to the speech signal. It is possible  that the 
more sharp edges an interrupted  speech signal contains,  a stronger  cor- 
respondence  between  neural activity  and the speech signal is observed,  
which might explain  the high rates of understanding  in conditions  with 
a high IR ( Gilbert et al., 2007 ).

a ﬁnger-tapping  task in which the two participants  were asked to tap 
their ﬁngers on either side of a liquid crystal screen. The screen switched  
from being opaque  to transparent  so the participants  could see each 
other in some blocks but not during others. The authors  found that 
ﬁnger-tapping  synchronization  increased  when participants  could see 
each other, demonstrating  that visual perception  is likely part of the 
synchronization  phenomenon.  
One explanation  for interpersonal  synchronization  lies in the inher- 
ent rhythmicity  of the motor and sensory  systems  of the brain. Motor 
behavior  is largely rhythmic  ( Molinari  et al., 2003 ) and it has been ar- 
gued that sensory  systems  work in a similar way in order to guide this 
behavior  ( Wilson & Cook, 2016 ). Canolty  & Knight (2010) proposed  that 
neural oscillations  mediate  the integration  between  these two systems,  
with information  being carried in ‘rhythmic  volleys’  or spikes of activ- 
ity. Rhythmic  sensory  stimuli have been shown to entrain  brain oscilla- 
tions ( Kizuk & Mathewson,  2017 ; Lakatos  et al., 2008 ). This timing ap- 
pears to be propagated  into the motor systems,  demonstrated  by studies 
that show reaction  times that appear to adjust according  to task rhythm  
( Lakatos  et al., 2008 ; Praamstra  et al., 2006 ). This may also be the reason 
why humans  and animals  are able to synchronize  in response  to each 
others’ movements  ( Wilson & Cook, 2016 ). Previous  studies of brain 
activity  during interpersonal  behavioral  synchronization  have found al- 
terations  in right parietal  channel  alpha-mu  as well as central and pari- 
etal channel  beta activity  ( Dumas et al., 2010 ; Fitzpatrick,  et al., 2019 ; 
Naeem et al., 2012 a; Novembre  et al., 2017 ). 
Cortical  alpha-mu  rhythms  have been related to behavioral  synchro-  
nization  between  individuals.  In particular,  event-related  desynchro-  
nization  (ERD) of these alpha-mu  rhythms  has been interpreted  as a sig- 
nal of the engagement  of neural populations  related to the processing  of 
internally  or externally  paced events ( Pfurtscheller  & Da Silva, 1999 ). 
This relationship  between  internal  motor actions and observations  of 
external  stimuli has been referred  to as the mirror neuron system 
(MNS),  which describes  a phenomenon  in which action observation  
and motor execution  activate  similar neural populations  ( Cochin et al., 
1998 , 1999 ; Oberman  et al., 2005 ; Rizzolatti  & Craighero,  2004 ). A re- 
view by Pineda (2005) suggested  that mirror neuron involvement  in 
the link between  perception  and action is reﬂected  in the mu rhythm  
with dominant  frequencies  in the 8-13 Hz range. Additionally,  several 
studies have linked alpha-mu  suppression  to engagement  of the MNS 
in humans  and monkeys  ( Cheng et al., 2008 ; Debnath,  et al., 2019 ; 
Dum et al., 2002 ; Fitzpatrick,  et al., 2019 ; Fox et al., 2016 ; Hobson,  
& Bishop,  2016 ; Muakkassa  & Strick, 1979 ; Oberman  & Ramachan-  
dran, 2007 ; Shimazu  et al., 2004 ). Alpha-mu  oscillations  (8-12 Hz) of 
right parietal  channels  have been related to social coordination  in sev- 
eral studies ( Dumas et al., 2010 ; Naeem et al., 2012 a; Naeem et al., 
2012 b; Tognoli  et al., 2007 ). For example,  Naeem et al. (2012 a) used a 
ﬁnger tracing task in which participants  were asked to follow their own 
intrinsic  rhythms,  move in-phase  with each other, and move anti-phase  
with each other in diﬀerent  blocks. They found signiﬁcant  alpha-mu  
(10-12 Hz) suppression  for the in-phase  compared  to intrinsic,  and also 
increased  suppression  in the anti-phase  compared  to in-phase  condition,  
particularly  in right parietal  channels  (i.e. CP4). These neural correlates  
have been only observed  in stationary  tasks, and therefore  it is not yet 
known if this alpha-mu  eﬀect during interpersonal  synchronization  will 
be corroborated  during an ambulatory  mobile coordination  task. 
Previous  studies on brain activity  during walking  often focus on 
beta oscillations  (13-30 Hz; Wagner  et al., 2016 , Bruijn, et al., 2015 ; 
Pizzamiglio  et al., 2017 ). Additionally,  beta modulations  in central and 
parietal  channel  areas have been associated  with interpersonal  syn- 
chrony during hand movements  ( Dumas et al., 2010 ; Novembre  et al., 
2017 ), possibly  due to their association  with the motor system.  During 
movement,  beta oscillations  captured  by central channels  located  near 
the motor cortex have been shown to be a main neuromarker  of motor 
activity,  with event-related  desynchronization  (ERD), that is, decreases  in beta power relative  to a non-moving  baseline,  indicating  increased  
motor system engagement  ( Cheyne  et al., 2013 ; Seeber et al., 2014 ; 
Seeber et al., 2015 ; Storzer,  et al., 2016 ; Wagner  et al., 2012 ). This eﬀect 
has been demonstrated  in both walking  and cycling,  as event-related  
beta power has been shown to decrease  during movement  execution,  
while increases  in beta band power have been associated  with move- 
ment termination  ( Storzer,  et al., 2016 ). During walking,  this leads to 
a mechanism  in which the beta range/low  gamma  (24-40 Hz) power 
in central channels  decreases  during sections  of the gait cycle approxi-  
mately before and during double-leg  support,  and increases  during ap- 
proximately  in the middle of phases with single-leg  support  or swing 
( Seeber et al., 2015 ; Wagner  et al., 2012 ). Seeber et al. (2014) sug- 
gested that there are distinct,  but overlapping  frequency  proﬁles  which 
modulate  between  standing  and walking  (18-30 Hz), and within walking  
throughout  the gait cycle (24-40 Hz). Slightly  diﬀerent  frequency  ranges 
and timings  have been found for both of these frequency  proﬁles  be- 
tween studies ( Gwin et al., 2011 ; Pizzamiglio  et al., 2017 ; Seeber et al., 
2015 ; Wagner  et al., 2012 ), possibly  due to diﬀerences  in gait speeds 
( Nordin et al., 2020 ) and gait tasks such as treadmill/overground  walk- 
ing ( Roeder et al., 2018 ), EEG systems  and data analysis  methods  
( Cohen, 2017 ). Several  studies suggest  that cortical  beta modulations  
throughout  the gait cycle transmit  eﬀerently  to spinal motoneurons  
during human walking  ( Roeder et al., 2018 ; Petersen  et al., 2012 ). 
Increased  movement  control has also been associated  with decreased  
beta power ( Jain et al., 2013 ; Wagner  et al., 2012 ). For example,  
Wagner  et al. (2012) used robot assisted  gait training  to determine  dif- 
ferences  in brain activity  to active (i.e. normal  walking)  vs. passive  (i.e. 
letting the robot assistant  move their legs) walking.  The authors  found 
suppressed  beta rhythms  at central midline  areas during active com- 
pared to passive  walking,  demonstrating  increased  motor system en- 
gagement  during the active walking.  
Interpersonal  synchronization  has been explored  previously  during 
walking  only behaviorally  ( Nessler  & Gilliland,  2009 ) and through  brain 
activity  during hand movements  ( Dumas et al., 2010 ; Fitzpatrick  et al., 
2019 ; Naeem et al., 2012 a; Tognoli  et al., 2007 ). However  at this point, 
most studies have been heavily  artiﬁcial,  using treadmills  and unnatu-  
ral tasks, and it is unknown  if previous  results could be applicable  to 
natural  gait. While synchronization  during walking  has been proposed  
as a method  for neurorehabilitation  ( Mendonça  et al., 2014 ; Nessler  & 
Gilliland,  2009 ), the components  of walking  and neuroimaging  have yet 
not been combined  to observe  this phenomenon  in the brain during nat- 
ural walking.  In the present  study we intend to address  this in a natural-  
istic outdoor  walking  task using concurrent  inertial  measurement  unit 
(IMU) and mobile EEG recordings.  Participants  wore mobile EEG and 
an IMU while walking  next to an experimenter  who wore an IMU, so 
that we could record participant  brain activity  and behavioral  synchro-  
nization  to the experimenter.  The experimenter  kept a consistent  gait, 
while the participant  had three walking  conditions.  In the ﬁrst condi- 
tion participants  had their view of the experimenter  blocked  ( blocked  ), 
in the second they walked  naturally  next to the experimenter  ( natural ) 
with no walking  instruction,  and in the third they were instructed  to 
synchronize  their steps in-phase  with the experimenter  ( sync ). Our ﬁrst 
hypothesis  was that behavioral  synchronization  would be highest  in the 
sync condition,  lowest in the blocked  condition  and moderate  in the natu- 
ral condition,  due to the level of visual information  and instruction  given 
to the participant.  Our second hypothesis  was that alpha-mu  rhythms,  
particularly  at right parietal  channels,  would have the lowest power 
during the sync condition,  highest  in the blocked  condition,  and moder-  
ate in the natural condition,  as these rhythms  were predicted  to relate 
inversely  to the level of behavioral  synchronization.  Finally,  our third 
hypothesis  was that beta power would be lower in the sync condition  
than the two non-instructed  conditions  ( blocked  and natural ), due to the 
explicit  motor system engagement  caused by an increase  in conscious  
control over one’s gait.

2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Data were collected  in combination  with a previous  already  pub- 
lished study addressing  signal quality of EEG during standing  and 
walking  ( Scanlon  et al., 2021 ). Twenty-six  participants  were recruited  
through  the Oldenburg  University  website  to participate  in the study. 
Each participant  was asked to come in on two separate  days, to do 
recording  with each of two electrode  conﬁgurations  (see Materials  ). Due 
to technical  issues (wireless  connection  problems)  during data collec- 
tion, the data from seven participants  were removed  from the study. 
Data of one participant  were removed  as the person was not able to 
attend the second recording  session.  Data from 18 participants  (mean 
age = 24 years; age range: 20–28 years; eight female)  were then left 
for the ﬁnal analysis.  Participants  received  an honorarium  of 10 €/hour 
and had no history of psychiatric  or neurological  problems.  The Olden- 
burg University  ethics committee  approved  the experimental  procedures  
(permit  number:  2019-001).  
2.2. Materials  
Participants  came in for two separate  recording  sessions,  using each 
of the active (actiCAP,  EasyCap  GmbH, Brain Products  GmbH)  and pas- 
sive (EasyCap  GmbH, Brain Products  GmbH)  electrode  conﬁgurations  
for the diﬀerent  recordings  once. This was originally  done to compare  
signal quality between  the two conﬁgurations.  No signiﬁcant  diﬀer- 
ences were found between  the two conﬁgurations  ( Scanlon  et al., 2021 ). 
Therefore,  we combined  the data from the two sessions  for the present  
analysis.  The two electrode  conﬁgurations  had identical  64 channel  lay- 
outs. Reference  and ground  electrodes  were embedded  at FCz and AFz 
(10-20 system)  locations  in the cap, respectively.  For all sessions,  the 
same two Brain Products  (GmbH;  Gilching,  Germany)  LiveAmp  ampli- 
ﬁers were used. Both experimenter  and participant  had a Faros 180°
eMotion  (Mega Electronics,  2017) accelerometer  ﬁxed to their right foot 
using elastic tape. The task was presented  and timed using NBS Presenta-  
tion (version  20.02, Neurobehavioral  Systems,  Inc., RRID: SCR_002521;  
Berkeley,  USA) on a Dell (Latitude  5289) Ultrabook,  which was con- 
trolled by the experimenter  using the touchscreen.  The script marked  the 
beginning  and end of each condition  in the EEG data. The same Ultra- 
book was used for collecting  the data, using the LiveAmpConnector  (ver- 
sion 1.16, bit.ly/31P2mrd)  and LSL (Lab Streaming  Layer; Swartz Center 
for Computational  Neuroscience  and Kothe, 2015 ) LabRecorder  (version  
1.13, bit.ly/2ULAFhb)  software  to time-synchronously  collect both the 
event markers  from NBS Presentation  and EEG channel  data. During ses- 
sions using active electrodes,  the Ultrabook  and LiveAmp  were placed 
into a small backpack,  which was customized  for computer  ventilation.  
Loose wires were tucked into the backpack  pockets  to minimize  cable 
movements.  During passive  electrode  sessions,  the LiveAmp  was placed 
on the top of the participant’s  head using elastic tape and a sponge cus- 
tomized  with holes to avoid any direct physical  pressure  on the under- 
lying electrodes.  For further details,  see Scanlon  et al. (2021) . The Ul- 
trabook  was also placed within the backpack  during passive  electrodes  
sessions.  Synchronization  reference  signals were sent into the EEG and 
accelerometer  data at the beginning  and end of each session.  For this, 
the Faros sensors  and LiveAmp  were plugged  into a sync-box  after the 
start and before the end of recordings.  The sync-box  is a device sim- 
ilar to the TriggerBox  (Brain Products  GmbH),  which sent TTL pulses 
into the accelerometer  and EEG data. We later used these signals to syn- 
chronize  the accelerometer  and EEG data for analysis  (for rationale,  see 
Artoni et al., 2018 ). Later, custom  MATLAB  scripts were used to prune 
the data streams  oﬄine into one synchronized  data ﬁle. The experiment  
took place in a roofed outdoor  basketball  arena on the Oldenburg  Uni- 
versity campus.  Participants  followed  a rectangular  route around the 
court marked  by pylons,  approximately  every 10 m. These were occa- 
sionally  adjusted  to avoid excessive  sunlight  or rain. 2.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5426, 5429), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(14163, 14165), match='3.'>"

structurally  and functionally  connected  are known to predict variability  
in evoked  pain responses  ( Wager et al., 2013 ) and the eﬀects of expec- 
tations on pain ( Gratton  et al., 2018 ). Structural  connectivity  also corre- 
lates with regional  tissue integrity  with pain severity,  pain unpleasant-  
ness, and pain duration  ( Spisak et al., 2020 ; Davis and Moayedi,  2013 ). 
An upshot of acknowledging  the sources  of such variability  in the brain 
is a better understanding  of how top-down  systems  shape subjective  dif- 
ferences  in pain response  and how they contribute  to chronic  pains, 
nocebo  eﬀects and treatment  failure.  
In this study, we investigate  the circuitry  that mediates  sensitivity  
to the threat of receiving  increasing  intensities  of pain. Previous  studies 
have shown that expectations  induced  by conditioned  cues alter pain 
in relation  with a change in both activity  and connectivity  in top-down  
attention/executive  networks  and several pain responsive  regions  in the 
brain ( Lim et al., 2020 ; Kong et al., 2013 ). We hypothesized  that struc- 
tural pathways  and functional  connectivity  between  these systems  will 
predict cued threat bias in healthy  participants.  This relationship  was 
expected  to be associated  with high pain catastrophizing  and low mind- 
fulness scores. 
Here we use a data-driven,  whole-brain  approach  to investigate  if 
structural  and functional  brain characteristics  play a role in mediating  
top-down  bias in pain perception.  We ﬁrst illustrate  the threat bias eﬀect 
by showing  that linear increases  in the threat of stronger  heat stimuli 
increases  pain responses  more steeply in a signiﬁcant  number  of healthy  
individuals.  Next, we used Fixel-Based  Analysis  (FBA) to delineate  white 
matter ﬁber density  (FD) of microstructural  ﬁbers to examine  if these 
properties  can predict inter-individual  variability  in threat bias. This 
new DWI model can examine  the properties  of individual  ﬁber popula-  
tions within a voxel instead  of voxel averages  and thus allow for better 
resolution  for DWI-derived  measures  ( Mito et al., 2018 ). With this tech- 
nique, we identiﬁed  a region within the splenium  that had low FD in 
people with higher top-down  threat bias. Next, we found that the mean 
rsFC within and between  speciﬁc  RSNs plays a role in mediating  top- 
down threat bias in pain perception  and is signiﬁcantly  associated  with 
both the splenium  FD and with higher pain catastrophizing  and low 
mindfulness.  Thus, we demonstrate  that the brain’s structural  and func- 
tional connectivity  plays an important  role in amplifying  pain ratings in 
relation  with increases  in threat of receiving  stronger  stimuli.  
Methods  
Participants  
A total of 42 healthy,  right-handed  participants,  21 of whom were 
female,  were recruited  for this study and provided  informed,  written  
consent.  The subjects  had an age range of 20–56 years and mean ± 
standard  deviation  (SD) of 31.23 ± 10.91 years. Exclusion  criteria  in- 
cluded any diagnosis  of or prescription  for pain disorders,  history of 
cardiac,  respiratory,  or neurological  diseases  that could interfere  with 
participation  in the study, and other contraindications  to MRI scanning  
( Lim et al., 2020 ). The MRI scans included  structural  T1-weighted  (T1w) 
images,  diﬀusion-weighted  images (DWI), and functional  resting-state  
and task scans, the latter of which included  the pain-perception  exper- 
iment. From the 42 subjects  who participated  in the study, diﬀusion-  
weighted  data and resting-state  data were successfully  collected  from 41 
(DWI) and 39 (resting  state) participants,  respectively.  The study proto- 
col was approved  by Research  Ethics Board of the Nova Scotia Health 
Authority.  Other, results from this data collection  have previously  been 
reported  ( Lim et al., 2020 ). 
Top-down  pain modulation  experimental  paradigm  
Participants  were presented  with visual and thermal  (i.e., heat) stim- 
uli while inside an MRI scanner.  The visual stimulus  was a threat cue 
in the form of a percentage  range (e.g. 70–80%),  to inform the par- 
ticipant  of the intensity  of the incoming  thermal  stimulus.  After the heat stimulus,  the subject was prompted  to rate their pain on a scale 
from 0 to 100. This procedure  was repeated  multiple  times across four 
diﬀerent  task runs consisting  of a matched-condition  run, a level 1 
mismatched-condition  run, and two level 2 mismatched-condition  runs. 
In the matched-condition  run, trials consisted  of varying  intensities  of 
pain stimulus  ranging  from 4",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5509, 5512), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(4951, 4953), match='3.'>"

( Dehaene,  1993 ; Romei et al., 2012 ), visual stimulations  ( Landau  and 
Fries, 2012 ; Fiebelkorn  et al., 2013 ), or TMS pulses ( Veniero  et al., 
2021 ). Externally  generated  events may act as an alignment  event by 
resetting  the phase of internal  rhythms  as they directly  interfere  with 
the neural activity  in the respective  sensory  areas, or by resetting  atten- 
tional dynamics.  Conversely,  examples  of internally  generated  events 
are motor acts like an arm movement  ( Tomassini  et al., 2015 ), a button 
press ( Benedetto  et al., 2016 ) or an eye movement  ( Bellet et al., 2017 ; 
Benedetto  and Morrone,  2017 ). Internally  generated  events may also 
act as an alignment  event by resetting  neural rhythms,  either through  
a corollary  discharge,  i.e., an eﬀerent  copy of the movement  plan sent 
by motor areas, or through  the generation  of new sensory  inputs, e.g., 
the retinal movement  during a saccade.  Alternatively,  or additionally,  
a motor action may act as an alignment  event by revealing  an internal  
rhythm,  if the motor act is produced  with some preference  for a partic- 
ular phase of that rhythm.  
When the rhythmicity  of behavioral  metrics  is directly  quantiﬁed,  
there are several challenges.  First, the data are very sparse: each trial 
provides  only one measure  of behavioral  performance  (e.g., hit or miss), 
which alone does not provide  any information  about rhythmicity.  Sec- 
ond, the sampling  of the data can be irregular,  and this can be a chal- 
lenge for traditional  frequency  analysis  methods  such as discrete  Fourier  
transform  (DFT). Third, in the existing  publications,  a variety of meth- 
ods for spectral  analysis  and for statistical  testing have been used, and 
there is no agreement  on which one oﬀers better sensitivity  and speci- 
ﬁcity. 
Here we will directly  compare  diﬀerent  methods  for spectral  analy- 
sis and diﬀerent  statistical  approaches,  including  an assessment  of their 
strengths  and weaknesses.  We ﬁrst generated  data through  a model re- 
sembling  a typical experiment,  we then quantiﬁed  rhythmicity  by vari- 
ous methods  and we evaluated  the sensitivity,  speciﬁcity,  and D -prime 
of each method.  
2. Methods  
We present  here the methods  and results for quantifying  rhythmic-  
ity in the accuracy  of behavioral  responses.  We use the term rhythmic-  
ity to refer to the dependence  of behavioral  responses  on the phase 
of a particular  frequency  or frequency  band –b u t see Discussion  for 
an elaboration  on this topic. The code can be obtained  here: https: 
//github.com/tosatot/quantifying-  rhythmicity-  in- perceptual-  reports.  
2.1. Data generation  
We simulated  behavioral  responses  in a detection  task ( Fig. 1 ). We 
assumed  that participants’  detection  threshold  is inﬂuenced  by an in- 
ternal rhythm,  and that this rhythm  is aligned  across trials to an event 
happening  at time zero. The rhythm’s  modulation  frequency,  its modu- 
lation phase relative  to the alignment  event, and its modulation-depth  
vary somewhat  across trials and participants,  yet they are suﬃciently  
consistent  to result in a rhythmic  modulation  of the mean detection  per- 
formance  ( Fig. 1 A–C). Additionally,  we simulated  a factor which inﬂu- 
ences the strength  of the rhythm  across time. In an actual experiment,  
such a factor needs to be observable,  e.g., pupil size, heart rate variabil-  
ity, skin conductance,  recent performance  history,  recent mean reaction  
time, time since beginning  the experiment.  
Speciﬁcally,  we assumed  the following.  (1) Within a participant,  and 
across trials : the rhythm’s  frequency  followed  a normal  distribution  
around the participant-speciﬁc  mean; its phase followed  a von-Mises  
distribution  around the participant-speciﬁc  mean phase; its modulation-  
depth varied with the arousal  state. We modelled  the state of arousal  to 
decrease  linearly  with trial number:  The ﬁrst trial had maximal  arousal  
equal to one, resulting  in the predeﬁned  maximal  value of modulation-  
depth, and the last trial had an arousal  equal to zero, resulting  in zero 
modulation-depth.  Note that simulated  arousal  could have been as- 
signed to diﬀerent  trials in any arbitrary  way, and this would not have aﬀected  the analysis  as long as arousal  was deﬁned  (or in an experiment  
measurable)  per trial. (2) Across participants  : the rhythm’s  participant-  
speciﬁc  mean frequency  followed  a normal  distribution  (with means dis- 
tributed  as shown in Fig. 1 D, unless otherwise  speciﬁed  for speciﬁc  anal- 
yses); its participant-speciﬁc  mean phase followed  a von-Mises  distribu-  
tion (with means distributed  as shown in Fig. 1 G, unless otherwise  spec- 
iﬁed for speciﬁc  analyses);  its participant-speciﬁc  maximal  modulation-  
depth followed  a normal  distribution  (with means distributed  as shown 
in Fig. 1 J, unless otherwise  speciﬁed  for speciﬁc  analyses);  sigma , the 
width of the Gaussian  distributions  of trial-speciﬁc  frequencies,  and 
kappa, the width of the von-Mises  distributions  of trial-speciﬁc  phases,  
follow a normal  distributions  (as shown in Fig. 1 E and H, respectively);  
the proportion  of valid trials in each participant  follows  a normal  distri- 
bution (as shown in Fig. 1 K). 
We initiated  the random-number  generator  with a unique seed for 
each simulation  run, and we simulated  each trial of each participant  in- 
dividually.  We started by constructing  the underlying  probability  func- 
tion of each trial, which expresses  the rhythmically  modulated  likeli- 
hood to detect a probe across diﬀerent  times after the aligning  event. 
We obtained  the trial-speciﬁc  target frequency  and the target phase 
randomly  drawing  from the frequency  and phase distributions  (distri- 
butions  shown in Fig. 1 F,I). The target frequency  was used to create 
a third order Butterworth  bandpass  ﬁlter with a passband  of ± 0.2 Hz 
around the target frequency.  Finally,  the underlying  probability  func- 
tion was generated  by ﬁltering  white noise (i.e., uncorrelated  samples  
uniformly  distributed  between  0 and 1). We discarded  suﬃcient  time 
(30 s) at the beginning  of the signal to allow the ﬁlter to settle to its 
steady state. After ﬁltering,  the resulting  signal was visibly oscillatory,  
but not perfectly  regular  like a sine wave, because  its phase did not 
progress  linearly  and its amplitude  was not constant.  The Hilbert trans- 
form was used to obtain the instantaneous  phase, and the start time 
was chosen by selecting  the sample that was closest to the target phase 
for that trial. From that moment  onward,  we extracted  1000 samples,  
corresponding  to 1 s, the total duration  of a trial. The amplitude  of 
the signal was scaled between  − 1 to 1, and multiplied  with the trial- 
speciﬁc  modulation-depth  value (obtained  by randomly  drawing  from 
the modulation-depth  distribution)  plus 0.5. This resulted  in an oscil- 
latory signal that ﬂuctuated  around 0.5 with extrema  approaching  0.5 
plus/minus  the modulation-depth  value. This signal then represented  
the underlying  probability  function  of detection  performance  for that 
trial. 
We call probe onset interval  (POI) the time between  the alignment  
event and the probe event, with the latter being the stimulus  event that 
participants  are supposed  to detect and report. The POI corresponds  to 
the stimulus  onset asynchrony  (SOA) of several previous  studies.  For 
each simulated  trial of each participant,  the POI was determined  as a 
random  time between  the alignment  event and the end of the trial, by 
drawing  it from a uniform  distribution  of values ranging  from 0.001 s to 
1 s in steps of 0.001 s. Note that in this process  we generate  an irregular  
sampling,  e.g., not all POIs are sampled  the same number  of times, and 
some POIs do not occur at all. 
Once a POI had been chosen for a trial, we looked up the value 
of that trial’s probability  function  at that POI time. We used the 
obtained  value as probability  in the following  Matlab function  call: 
“y = datasample([  − 1,1],1, ”weights  ”,[1-probability,probability])  “. Each 
such call gave a value of − 1 or 1, with the respective  probabilities  sum- 
ming to one. We refer to these outcome  options  as behavioral  response  
value (BRV) and we consider  a value of 1 to correspond  to a correct 
detection,  and a value of − 1 to correspond  to a missed detection.  
We simulated  400 trials per participant  (except  otherwise  noted).  
Only a subset of the trials were labeled  as “valid ”, as it is often the case 
in a real experiment.  In each participant,  trials had a certain random  
probability  to be labeled  as “valid ”. This participant-speciﬁc  probability  
was determined  by randomly  sampling  a Gaussian  distribution  of mean 
0.8 and sigma 0.07 (as shown in Fig. 1 J).

2.2. Methods  evaluated  
The analysis  of rhythmicity,  both for the simulated  and any empirical  
data, starts with an array, which contains  for each trial one POI and 
one corresponding  BRV. In the case considered  here, the POI assumes  
values between  0 s and 1 s, and the BRV assumes  values of 1 for a correct 
detection,  and of − 1 for a missed detection.  
The working  hypothesis  is that there is a rhythm,  aligned  to or reset 
by an event, which modulates  detection  performance  according  to the 
rhythm’s  phase and amplitude  at the moment  of a probe event. The 
precise frequency  of the rhythm  is not known beforehand,  therefore  we 
need to test all plausible  frequencies.  That is, we need to perform  the 
analysis  in a spectrally  resolved  manner.  Furthermore,  neither  the phase 
of the rhythm  at the alignment  event is known,  nor the phase that leads 
to good or bad detection  performance.  
To test the working  hypothesis,  we need to relate POIs to BRVs, con- 
sidering  POIs in terms of spectral  phases.  We can proceed  in two dif- 
ferent ways. One option is to ﬁrst combine  all POIs and BRVs into an average  accuracy  time course (per participant,  or even for the entire 
group of participants),  and then to spectrally  analyze  it. Another  option 
is to determine  the spectral  phases of all POIs (see below for further 
explanation  on this) and relate them to their corresponding  BRVs, e.g., 
through  DFT or LSS. 
Both approaches  require  estimating  the spectrum  of the BRVs as a 
function  of their corresponding  POIs. This spectral  estimation  involves  
or is equivalent  to a Fourier  transform,  and therefore,  we require  the 
BRVs to be tapered  to avoid leakage  of spectral  energy,  in particular  
when zero padding  or when testing for frequencies  which are not an 
integer multiple  of the Rayleigh  frequency.  Furthermore,  the spectral  
estimation  beneﬁts  from the data to be detrended  before the Fourier  
transform.  Empirical  detection  performance  data after a reset often show 
longer-term  trends, with the rhythms  of interest  superimposed.  There- 
fore, we chose to perform  a linear detrending  (equivalent  to a ﬁrst-order  
polynomial  detrending)  of the performance  time series, as we have done 
in a previous  empirical  study ( Landau  and Fries, 2012 ). Linear detrend-  
ing removes  oﬀsets and linear trends, which can be large relative  to 
3  T. Tosato, G. Rohenkohl,  J.R. Dowdall et al. NeuroImage  262 (2022) 119561 
rhythmic  components,  and it otherwise  minimally  aﬀects the spectrum.  
Note that higher-order  polynomial  detrending  can eﬀectively  constitute  
a high-pass  ﬁltering  of the data, which renders  the resulting  spectra  
harder to interpret.  Note also that we did not actively  add any trend to 
our simulated  data, such that detrending  would not have been required.  
However,  in order to make the presented  methods  and code directly  
applicable  to empirical  behavioral  data, we included  linear detrending  
also for the simulated  data.

Studies  have assessed  how varying  preprocessings  of magnetic  res- 
onance imaging  (MRI) data inﬂuence  the results of dynamical  whole- 
brain models.  They showed  that the models are sensitive  to variations  in 
the pipelines  reconstructing  the SC and the FC from diﬀusion-weighted  
MRI (dwMRI)  and resting-state  functional  MRI (fMRI) images,  respec- 
tively ( Aquino  et al., 2022; Jung et al., 2021 ), and how the model ﬁt- 
ting may depend  on the properties  of the empirical  data used for model 
derivation  and validation  ( Domhof  et al., 2021b; Popovych  et al., 2021 ). 
Nevertheless,  the methodological  aspects  of the (test-retest)  reliability  
and the subject speciﬁcity  of the modeling  results and their relation  to 
the empirical  data have not been extensively  investigated  so far. In con- 
trast, the reliability  of the FC derived  from fMRI data, which is used 
for model validation,  has been scrutinized  in many studies over a pe- 
riod longer than a decade ( Birn et al., 2013; Noble et al., 2019; 2017; 
Pannunzi  et al., 2017; Shehzad  et al., 2009; Van Dijk et al., 2010 ). Its 
subject speciﬁcity  reﬂected  by, for example,  ﬁngerprinting  analysis  has 
received  much attention  as well ( Amico et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2015; 
Peña Gómez et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021; Sarar et al., 2021; Waller et al., 
2017 ). Also the subject speciﬁcity  of the empirical  structure-function  re- 
lationship  has been considered  in the literature  ( Messé, 2020; Zimmer-  
mann et al., 2018a ). Hence, comprehensive  assessments  of the reliability  
and the subject speciﬁcity  of the modeling  results and their relation  with 
the empirical  data are due. 
This study therefore  critically  assesses  the reliability  and subject 
speciﬁcity  of the results of the model validation  and their relations  with 
the empirical  connectomes  across a wide variety of conditions  for model 
construction  such as model deﬁnition  and wielded  parcellation.  In short, 
it demonstrates  that the results of the model ﬁtting may be more reli- 
able and subject speciﬁc  than the empirical  data. However,  our results 
also show that this ﬁnding  highly depends  on the modeling  conditions.  
In fact, for some of the tested circumstances  we found a reliability  and 
subject speciﬁcity  that are substantially  lower for the modeling  results 
than for the empirical  data. Moreover,  we explicitly  show that the mod- 
els can integrate  various  types of subject-speciﬁc  information  extracted  
from empirical  data into their output.  This makes our study relevant  for 
application,  especially,  given the current  focus on the involvement  of 
dynamical  whole-brain  models in clinical  investigations,  for example,  
in the framework  of precision  medicine.  
2. Materials  and methods  
In the current  study, we assessed  the reliability  and the subject speci- 
ﬁcity of the ﬁts of the dynamical  whole-brain  models to the empirical  
FC. We ﬁrst constructed  such models on the basis of the empirical  SC de- 
rived from dwMRI  data ( Fig. 1 ). Subsequently,  we independently  ﬁtted 
them to diﬀerent  realizations  of the empirical  FC (the FC derived  from 
resting-state  fMRI data) of individual  subjects  by optimizing  the (global)  
model parameters  through  a grid search paradigm  ( Fig. 1 ). By doing so, 
we obtained  the optimal  model parameters  that were used by the mod- 
els to generate  the associated  simulated  FCs that provided  the best ﬁts of 
the model to these separate  realizations  of empirical  FC. 
We subsequently  calculated  the intraclass  correlation  (ICC) of the 
individual  optimal  model parameters  as characterizations  of their relia- 
bility. Additionally,  we calculated  the same quantity  for the individual  
(undirected)  edges of the empirical  and ﬁtted simulated  FCs, and in- 
spected  the distribution  of these ICCs across connections  to examine  the 
reliabilities  of those connectomes.  We also computed  the single-modal  
connectome  correlations  , where diﬀerent  realizations  of the empirical  and 
the ﬁtted simulated  FCs were separately  compared  with each other for 
the same subject (within-subject)  or diﬀerent  subjects  (between-subject)  
to determine  how variable  the connectivity  patterns  are for the same 
and diﬀerent  subjects  ( Fig. 1 , blue arrows).  Furthermore,  we determined  
the within-  and between-subject,  cross-modal  connectome  correlations  
to study how the diﬀerent  types of connectivity  related to one another.  
Here we named the correlations  calculated  between  the empirical  SC 
and both types of FC (empirical  and simulated)  the structure-function  cor- relations  ( Fig. 1 , red arrows),  and those computed  between  the empirical  
and the simulated  FC the model-ﬁt  correlations  ( Fig. 1 , brown arrows).  
Finally,  we considered  all values of similarity  (Pearson  correlation)  be- 
tween the empirical  and simulated  FC established  at the model valida- 
tion by the parameter  grid search, which are referred  to as a similarity  
map. We examined  how the similarity  maps relate to one another  within 
and between  subjects.  
We repeated  our calculations  using 8 distinct  parcellations  for the re- 
construction  of the empirical  SC and FC from the MRI data to determine  
whether  a change of brain atlas could critically  alter the conclusions.  In 
addition,  we repeated  our computations  for 6 distinct  dynamical  whole- 
brain model implementations  to investigate  whether  varying  model per- 
sonalization  and model complexity  may yield qualitatively  diﬀerent  re- 
sults. 
Below we describe  the wielded  procedures  in detail. The code

ysis and the visualization  can be found here: https://jugit.fz-

radiofrequency  pulse. (For interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
constraints  either on compartment  parameters  or the functional  form of 
the ﬁber ODF; such constraints  improve  robustness  but may introduce  
biases into the estimation  of remaining  parameters  (cf. recent reviews  by 
Alexander  et al., 2019; Jelescu  and Budde, 2017; Novikov  et al., 2019 ). 
The constraints  are typically  employed  when analyzing  common  dMRI 
acquisition  protocols  based on low-to-intermediate  diﬀusion  weightings  
with pulsed ﬁeld gradient  (PFG) measurements,  since the problem  of re- 
covering  unconstrained  SM parameters  is ill-conditioned  ( Jelescu  et al., 
2016a; Novikov  et al., 2018 ). 
Multidimensional  diﬀusion  MRI ( Mitra, 1995; Topgaard,  2017; 
Westin et al., 2016 ) is a way to encode diﬀusion  along more than one 
direction,  probing  the response  to an ellipsoid  encoded  by a 3 ×3 𝑩 - 
tensor (cf. Fig. 2 and Section  2 below).  This adds complementary  in- 
formation  to that accessible  through  conventional  PFG, also known as 
linear tensor encoding  (LTE) ( Jespersen  et al., 2013; Szczepankiewicz  
et al., 2016 ). To resolve the degeneracy  in SM parameter  estimation,  
PFG/LTE  has been combined  with planar tensor encoding  (PTE) at inter- 
mediate  diﬀusion  weightings  ( Coelho et al., 2019b; Reisert et al., 2019 ). 
Fieremans  et al. (2018) and Dhital et al. (2018) analyzed  the advantages  
of combining  LTE with spherical  tensor encoding  (STE), and PTE, respec- 
tively, for SM parameter  estimation.  Similary,  Afzali et al. (2019) used 
numerical  simulations  to compare  the estimation  errors of the SM for 
a few discrete  combinations  of LTE, PTE and STE encodings.  While 
all these studies show the value of multidimensional  MRI for im- 
proving  SM parameter  estimation,  some combinations  of 𝑩 -tensor en- codings  provide  more precise and accurate  estimation  results than 
others. 
Optimizing  the parameter  estimation  is a complementary  way to 
increase  precision.  This has made supervised  machine  learning  (ML)- 
based approaches  gain attention  lately. Neural networks  ( Golkov et al., 
2016 ), polynomial  regression  ( Reisert et al., 2017 ), or random  for- 
est ( Palombo  et al., 2020 ) have provided  useful results in diﬀerent  
dMRI applications.  ML has been applied  to estimate  SM parameters  by 
Reisert et al. (2017) , and in more recent works ( Coelho et al., 2021a; 
de Almeida  Martins  et al., 2021; Gyori et al., 2022 ). Irrespective  of the 
implementation,  all these works concluded  that ML estimation  alone is 
unable to resolve SM parameter  degeneracies,  and that a suﬃciently  rich 
acquisition  protocol  is needed.  Furthermore,  Coelho et al. (2021b)  re- 
cently showed  theoretically  that data-driven  approaches  become  in- 
creasingly  inﬂuenced  by the ML prior (the training  set) as the signal- 
to-noise  ratio (SNR) decreases,  and that an optimal  acquisition  mini- 
mizes such an undesired  eﬀect. This was also observed  empirically  by 
Gyori et al. (2022) . 
In this work we aim to use ML not only to improve  parameter  es- 
timation,  but also to guide the experimental  design. Acquisition  opti- 
mization  strategies  are needed  to reduce scan times and/or improve  
quality of SM parameter  estimation.  Alexander  (2008) optimized  PFG 
diﬀusion  sequence  parameters  for a parallel  ﬁbers biophysical  model. 
More recently,  Coelho et al. (2019a)  explored  the space of isotrop-  
ically distributed  𝑩 -tensors  and selected  the combination  that maxi- 
2  S. Coelho, S.H. Baete, G. Lemberskiy  et al. NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119290 
mized the precision  of the cumulant  tensor elements  up to the second 
order in 𝑩 . Interestingly,  this work did not impose measurements  to 
be grouped  in shells, but these emerged  from the optimization.  Sub- 
sequently,  Lampinen  et al. (2020) used the Cramér-Rao  bound (CRB) 
( Cramér,  1946; Rao, 1945 ) of the SM parameters  to optimize  the acqui- 
sition for an extended  version  of the SM that also accounts  for intra- 
compartmental  𝑇 2 relaxation  values ( Veraart  et al., 2018 ). While the 
CRB provides  a lower bound on the variance  for an unbiased  estimator,  
this is not necessarily  optimal  for ML estimators  which are usually  biased 
at the expense  of increased  precision.  Here we propose  to use instead  
the (root) mean squared  error (R)MSE  as a quality metric for experiment  
design, as it enables  trading  oﬀbetween  bias and precision  at each SNR. 
Hence, minimal  MSE, rather than a proxy like the CRB, is a target for the 
protocol  design. Furthermore,  the optimal  protocol  precision  serves as 
a benchmark  for the experimental  precision  in a reproducibility  study, 
where other inevitable  factors,  such as imaging  artifacts  and misregis-  
tration,  can aﬀect the net parameter  variation.  
Complementary  to the search for the optimal  acquisition,  there 
has been an increasingly  prescient  need to evaluate  reproducibility  of 
dMRI, to enable its adoption  in clinic and clinical  research.  Grech- 
Sollars et al. (2015) performed  a multi-center  reproducibility  study of 
apparent  diﬀusion  coeﬃcient  (ADC) and diﬀusion  tensor imaging  (DTI) 
parameters  with 1.5T and 3T MRI scanners,  and found the relative  error 
(coeﬃcient  of variation,  or COV) of < 4% for average  values in diﬀer- 
ent WM regions  of interest  (ROI). For diﬀusion  kurtosis  imaging  (DKI) 
( Jensen et al., 2005 ), Henriques  et al. (2021) recently  proposed  a reg- 
ularized  estimator  and studied  its reproducibility  on diﬀerent  publicly  
available  datasets.  Modeling  the dMRI signal aims for more speciﬁc  in- 
formation  than the above signal representations.  Andica et al. (2020) as- 
sessed scan-rescan  and inter-vendor  reproducibility  of neurite  orienta-  
tion dispersion  and density  imaging  metrics  ( Zhang et al., 2012 ), which 
is a constrained  version  of the SM. However,  reproducibility  studies 
for the unconstrained  SM are so far lacking  because  they require  non- 
conventional  (beyond-LTE)  diﬀusion  data. 
The main outcomes  of this work are (i) a framework  that mini- 
mizes the estimation  error of the SM parameters  by coupling  experi- 
ment design with ML-based  parameter  estimation,  and (ii) its validation  
in a reproducibility  study involving  20 healthy  volunteers  that under- 
went dMRI on two clinical  scanners  with diﬀerent  gradient  strengths.  In 
Section  2 we introduce  the SM adapted  for multidimensional  dMRI, and 
the ML-based  parameter  estimation.  In Section  3 we describe  the experi- 
mental design, image acquisition,  and processing.  In Section  4 we report 
the resulting  15-minute  optimal  acquisition  protocols  for two 3T scan- 
ners with corresponding  gradient  strengths  of 40 and 80 mT∕m , Fig. 3 . 
We assess the optimized  protocols  via numerical  noise propagation  and 
in vivo experiments,  Fig. 4 . Finally,  in Section  5 we quantify  the repro- 
ducibility  of SM parameter  estimates  for 20 control subjects  that un- 
derwent  scan-rescan  on both scanners.  Our optimized  protocol  achieves  
voxelwise  COV ≲10% for all SM parameters  except free water fraction;  
the COV for ROI-averaged  values are 1 − 4% , Fig. 6 . These actual experi- 
mental values turn out to be in a good agreement  with predictions  based 
on the optimal  MSE. 
2. Theory  
2.1. Multidimensional  dMRI 
Multidimensional  dMRI, also known as 𝑞-space trajectory  imaging  
(QTI) ( Eriksson  et al., 2013; Westin et al., 2016 ), probes a trajectory  
𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) , rather than a point in the diﬀusion  𝑞-space, within a single mea- 
surement.  In other words, QTI treats the dMRI signal as a functional  of 
𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) , rather than a function  of 𝒒 , which results in the signal being sensi- 
tive to displacements  along multiple  dimensions  simultaneously.  
For Gaussian  diﬀusion,  the picture gets simpliﬁed,  as the cumulant  
series is truncated  at the level of the second-order  velocity  cumulant  
⟨𝑣 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑣 𝑗 ( 𝑡 ′) ⟩= 2 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 𝛿( 𝑡 − 𝑡 ′) deﬁning  the diﬀusion  tensor 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 . Hence, the signal 
𝑆[ 𝒒 ( 𝑡 )] = ⟨𝑒 𝑖 ∫d 𝑡 𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) ⋅𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) ⟩= 𝑒 − ∑
𝑖𝑗 𝐵 𝑖𝑗 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 (1) 
gets reduced  to a function  of the 3 ×3 symmetric  tensor 𝑩 = ( 𝐵 𝑖𝑗 ) : 
𝐵 𝑖𝑗 = ∫TE 
0 𝑞 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑞 𝑗 ( 𝑡 ) d 𝑡, with 
𝑞 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) = ∫𝑡 
0 𝑔 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ′) d 𝑡 ′, and 𝑏 = ∑
𝑖 𝐵 𝑖𝑖 , (2) 
where the trace of 𝑩 is the conventional  𝑏 -value 2 , and 𝐠 ( 𝑡 ) = d 𝒒 ∕d 𝑡 is the 
diﬀusion  gradient  waveform  used to generate  the trajectory.  Hence, for a 
medium  ( e.g. , a voxel) comprised  of multiple  non-exchanging  Gaussian-  
diﬀusion  compartments  (in general,  anisotropic,  such as in the SM), the 
𝑩 -tensor fully parametrizes  the measurement.  
The number  of nonzero  eigenvalues  in 𝑩 reﬂects  how many dimen- 
sions of the anisotropic  Gaussian  diﬀusion  are being probed simultane-  
ously. In this work, we focus on axially symmetric  𝑩 :

𝛽𝑢 𝑖 𝑢 𝑗 + 1 − 𝛽
3 𝛿𝑖𝑗 )

that are parametrized  by the overall scale (the 𝑏 -value),  the unit vector 
̂𝒖 along the symmetry  axis, and the adimensional  shape parameter  𝛽
( Fig. 2 a). Compared  to conventional  dMRI, the extra degree of freedom  
𝛽represents  the 𝑩 -tensor shape, e.g. , 𝛽= 1 for linear encoding  (a single 
nonzero  eigenvalue),  𝛽= 0 for spherical  encoding  (isotropic  𝑩 -tensor),  
and 𝛽= − 1 
2 for planar encoding  (two nonzero  eigenvalues).  Here 𝛿𝑖𝑗 is 
the Kronecker  symbol  (the unit matrix).  
The encoding  time required  for the gradient  waveforms  correspond-  
ing to a given 𝑩 -tensor depends  on its shape and b-value.  Fig. 2 b shows

declines  in cognitive  control are linked to declines  in frontal midline  
theta oscillations  ( Cavanagh  and Frank, 2014 ). This important  link high- 
lights frontal midline  theta oscillations  as a target to combat  age-related  
cognitive  decline.  Elucidating  the mechanisms  by which such interven-  
tion improves  cognition  in aging holds the potential  to increase  quality 
of life through  remediation  of lost cognitive  abilities  and prophylaxis  of 
decline  in vulnerable  aging populations.  
Age-related  cognitive  decline  is associated  with decreased  cortical  
volume  ( Jernigan  et al., 2001 ), particularly  in prefrontal  cortex (PFC) 
( Raz et al., 2010 ), a critical region supporting  cognitive  control.  Ad- 
ditionally,  deterioration  of white matter integrity  is common  in older 
adults ( Salat et al., 2005 ; Pagani et al., 2008 ; Bennett  et al., 2012 ), es- 
pecially  in longer tracts ( Yang et al., 2016 ), thereby  reducing  the quality 
of anatomical  connections  throughout  the brain. Given these anatomi-  
cal changes,  it is not surprising  that functional  connectivity  also changes  
across the lifespan  ( Davis et al., 2008 ), as both local and inter-regional  
dynamics  are disrupted  in aging ( Courtney  and Hinault,  2021 ). Because  
structural  and functional  connectivity  are vital to maintaining  cogni- 
tion ( Hausman  et al., 2021 ; Chan et al., 2021 ; Changeux  et al., 2021 ), 
interventions  seeking  to improve  cognition  in aging should identify  and 
target connectivity  mechanisms  ( Grover et al., 2021 ). The implications  
for identifying  such mechanisms  are immense,  as abnormal  patterns  of 
connectivity  are also a fundamental  feature of many clinical  disorders  
( Bullmore  and Sporns,  2009 ). 
One approach  to synchronize  brain rhythms  is through  noninva-  
sive transcranial  alternating  current  stimulation  (tACS) ( Grover et al., 
2021 ). TACS entrains  neural oscillations  at speciﬁc  frequencies  
( Herrmann  et al., 2013 ) and is safe, tolerable,  and cost eﬀective  
( Chaieb et al., 2014 ). When tACS successfully  synchronizes  brain 
rhythms,  functional  connectivity  is increased  ( K.T. Jones et al., 2020 ; 
K.T. Jones et al., 2020 ; Kim et al., 2021 ; Jones et al., 2017 ; 
Reinhart  and Nguyen,  2019 ), and results show promise  for enhancing  
( Alekseichuk  et al., 2016 ) and rescuing  ( Reinhart  and Nguyen,  2019 ) 
working  memory  across the lifespan.  In younger  adults, PFC theta 
tACS also shows promise  for improving  sustained  attention,  related 
to strengthened  alpha (8–12 Hz) connectivity  in the dorsal attention  
network  ( Rostami  et al., 2021 ). Improved  inhibitory  control has also 
been observed  following  PFC theta tACS, however,  only when the 
theta frequency  matches  an individual’s  peak frequency  ( Klírováet  al., 
2021 ), similar to results from working  memory  studies ( Reinhart  and 
Nguyen,  2019 ). The recent successes  of tACS, when optimized  to aﬀect 
brain networks,  set the groundwork  for developing  therapeutics  for in- 
dividuals  with clinical  diagnoses  that implicate  cognitive  control.  
We previously  demonstrated  the utility of a cognitive  control video 
game training  paradigm  in healthy  older adults, in which improved  mul- 
titasking  performance  was linked to increased  theta activity  in medial 
PFC (i.e., frontal midline  theta) and synchrony  between  medial PFC and 
posterior  regions  ( Anguera  et al., 2013 ). Given the observed  medial PFC 
theta eﬀects and importance  of frontal midline  theta in cognitive  con- 
trol ( Cavanagh  and Frank, 2014 ), we next investigated  whether  a single 
session of sham-controlled  theta tACS to medial PFC would enhance  cog- 
nitive control in young adults ( Hsu et al., 2019 ; Hsu et al., 2017 ). Partici-  
pants who received  theta tACS (6 Hz), compared  to control tACS (sham),  
showed  enhanced  performance,  and increased  broadband  EEG power –
particularly  in posterior  regions  within the beta (12–30 Hz) band. In a 
follow-up  study, we applied  theta tACS to medial PFC during cognitive  
control training  in older adults ( Zanto et al., 2021 ). Participants  who 
received  theta tACS (6 Hz) showed  greater behavioral  gains than those 
who received  control tACS (1 Hz) and, similar to young adults, exhibited  
increased  posterior  beta band activity.  Yet, group diﬀerences  were not 
as robust as in young adults. Using individualized  models of the tACS- 
induced  electrical  ﬁeld, we found that age-related  cortical  atrophy  at- 
tenuated  the amount  of stimulation  that reached  the cortex, explaining  
some of the older adults’ variability  in performance  outcomes.  
Our previous  report assessing  eﬀects of theta tACS in aging focused  
on pre-registered  hypotheses  relating  tACS’ eﬀects on performance  to re- gional neuroanatomy  and neurophysiology  ( Zanto et al., 2021 ). Here, we 
recognize  the importance  of network-level  analysis  considering  known 
variability  in brain connectivity  among older adults ( Davis et al., 2008 ; 
Courtney  and Hinault,  2021 ; Chan et al., 2021 ; Hinault  et al., 2021 ). 
Therefore,  we report new analyses  to characterize  how structural  and 
functional  connectivity  contribute  to tACS’ eﬀects during cognitive  con- 
trol training  in aging, and the frequency  speciﬁcity  of eﬀects. We nar- 
rowed the scope of our analyses  to investigate  the behavioral  and inter- 
regional  neural changes  observed  during training,  and between  active 
theta and control tACS groups receiving  the same length of training  
and stimulation.  Based on our previous  results demonstrating  broad- 
band changes  in posterior  spectral  activity  following  frontal theta tACS 
( Hsu et al., 2019 ; Hsu et al., 2017 ), we tested the hypothesis  that in- 
dividual  cognitive  control gains following  frontal theta tACS would be 
associated  with increased  frontal-posterior  broadband  functional  con- 
nectivity,  which in turn would be associated  with the integrity  of long- 
range white matter tracts. Supporting  this hypothesis  are recent reports 
linking preserved  white matter in older adults with preserved  cognitive  
control mediated  by long-range  functional  connectivity  in the alpha and 
gamma  bands ( Hinault  et al., 2021 ; Hinault  et al., 2020 ). Our ﬁndings:  
1) provide  mechanistic  insight into how frontal tACS aﬀects long-range  
neural synchrony,  2) facilitate  applied  research  seeking  to rescue cog- 
nitive control in older adults at risk of further decline  ( Grover et al., 
2021 ), and 3) inform models of electrophysiological  brain networks  in 
aging ( Sadaghiani  et al., 2022 ). 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
40 older adults (26 females/14  males; M ± SD age, 6 Hz: 66.45 ± 4.99 
years; 1 Hz: 67.85 ± 5.41 years) completed  a week-long  cognitive  con- 
trol training  paradigm.  All participants  were between  60 and 78 years 
old, had no history of neurological  or psychiatric  disease  (e.g., seizures),  
no history of brain tumors,  were not taking medications  that modu- 
late brain excitability  (e.g., neuroleptic,  anti-depressant,  stimulant,  hyp- 
notic), had no amblyopia,  strabismus,  or color blindness,  and did not 
have a pacemaker.  Prior to enrollment,  all participants  completed  an 
in-person  neuropsychological  screener  that included:  California  Verbal 
Learning  Test-II, animal ﬂuency,  digit symbol,  Patient Health Question-  
naire, Delis-Kaplan  Executive  Functioning  System Trails, Number  and 
Number-Letter,  Stroop,  Measurement  of Everyday  Cognition,  Ishihara  
Color Deﬁciency  test, physical  assessments  (chair sitting and standing  
speed),  hearing,  and visual acuity. All participants  scored within 2 SD 
of standardized  scores on each of the 12 of neuropsychological  and 
physical  function  assessments.  Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA 
( Nasreddine  et al., 2005 )) scores ranged from 23 to 30 and were not sig- 
niﬁcantly  diﬀerent  between  tACS groups ( M ± SD, 6 Hz: 27.05 ± 2.50; 
1 Hz: 26.05 ± 2.67; p = 0.25; Supplementary  Figure 1). All participants  
signed informed  consent  documents  approved  by the University  of Cal- 
ifornia,  San Francisco  Institutional  Review  Board. Participants  received  
$20 per hour for participation  and $50 bonus for completing  the study. 
2.2. NeuroRacer  paradigm  
The NeuroRacer  cognitive  control video game was developed  
using the OpenGL  Utility Toolkit  (GLUT;  http://www.opengl.org/  
resources/libraries/glut/  ) to serve as a multitasking  challenge  that as- 
sesses visual discrimination  (sign matching)  while simultaneously  per- 
forming  visuomotor  tracking  (driving  a car; see ( Anguera  et al., 2013 ) 
for details).  The visuomotor  tracking  driving  task required  participants  
to control a constantly  moving  car in the center of the road within yel- 
low and red boundaries  at a ﬁxed speed as the road turned horizontally  
and moved up and down hills. The visual discrimination  sign matching  
task required  participants  to press a button with their right thumb on the 
same controller  (Logitech  controller,  USA). Participants  were instructed

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118825,"2. Results  
2.1. Univoxel  versus multivoxel  eﬀects 
Better classiﬁcation  performance  using MVPA can be a trivial con- 
sequence  of the fact that classiﬁcation  is always a monotonically  non- 
decreasing  function  of the number  of voxels in a searchlight  ( Fig. 1 A). As 
can be seen increasing  the number  of voxels results in larger Crossnobis  
distance  ( Nili et al., 2020 ) across two conditions  and thereby  improv-  
ing classiﬁcation  accuracy  for any classiﬁer  such as linear discriminant  
analysis  (LDA) ( Misaki et al., 2010 ) (see Section  4 ) ( Fig. 1 B). It can be ar- 
gued that almost all previously  reported  MVPA results could arise from 
a mere increase  in sensitivity  which is expected  when combining  a large 
number  of ‘weak classiﬁers’  (i.e. single voxels) within searchlights  and 
solving  the classiﬁcation  in a higher-dimensional  space ( Haxby et al., 
2001; Kamitani  and Tong, 2005; Tong and Pratte, 2012 ). 
While such results may be used as evidence  for the spatial spread 
of coding beyond  a single voxel, they hardly address  whether  there is 
coordinated  activity  between  voxels that are diﬀerent  across conditions.  
Note that the spatial spread of coding is also often readily observed  using 
simple univariate  GLMs unless voxels in the searchlight  show mostly 
subthreshold  activations  that can only reach signiﬁcance  when MVPA 
is used (again via increasing  sensitivity  by using a large number  of ‘weak 
classiﬁers’).  
As a result in many studies,  it has been a challenge  to determine  to 
what degree the results of MVPA are simply a byproduct  of UVE as op- 
posed to representing  a real MVE code ( Coutanche,  2013; Hebart and 
Baker, 2018 ). Several  studies have assumed  that in general  if voxels 
show similar activation  across conditions  (e.g. increased  or decreased  
activation  in all voxels between  two conditions),  MVPA is simply a 
byproduct  of multiple  UVEs ( Coutanche,  2013; Hebart and Baker, 2018 ) 
and on the other hand, when there is diﬀerential  activity  across vox- 
els across task conditions,  the activation  pattern  is assumed  to repre- 
sent a real MVE code. Fig. 1 C shows a graphical  representation  of UVE 
and MVE according  to the aforementioned  interpretation  for two voxels 
across two conditions.  MVPA activations  are interpreted  as UVE when 
activation  changes  are largely similar for both voxels across the two con- 
ditions (i.e. activation  falling on the unity line which represents  equal 
sensitivity,  UVE axis). In this scenario,  MVE is a component  that is added to the UVE in the direction  perpendicular  to the UVE axis. In reality, the 
actual activation  of our two example  voxels can show a mixture  of both 
UVE and MVE ( Fig. 1 C right). A conventional  method  employed  to re- 
move UVE from MVE is then to remove  the part of the eﬀect that has 
the same sign and amplitude  across all voxels ( Hebart and Baker, 2018; 
Nili et al., 2020 ) ( Fig. 1 D). This procedure  is separately  performed  for 
each condition.  In the geometric  sense, MVE is extracted  by shifting  all 
samples  in each condition  such that the sum of voxel values for each 
sample becomes  zero ( Hebart and Baker, 2018 ). 
Unfortunately,  such interpretation  of MVPA can be erroneous  for 
at least two reasons:  (1) Current  UVE interpretation  implicitly  assumes  
equal sensitivity  to conditions  across voxels. However,  it is well-known  
that a given voxel’s sensitivity  to task conditions  can be aﬀected  by a va- 
riety of factors not related to neural activity  per se, including  imaging  
sequence  used, RF coil function  and positioning,  subject motion,  dif- 
ferences  in local susceptibility  and partial volume  eﬀect. In the other 
words, non-neural  sources  can cause some voxels to show lower or 
higher sensitivity  to condition  1 versus condition  2 ( Fig. 1 C right panel) 
and thus multidimensional  responses  to fall out of unity line. Such diﬀer- 
ential sensitivity  across voxels can be taken as evidence  for MVE as op- 
posed to UVE in the absence  of a meaningful  neural correlate.  (2) More 
importantly  from a computational  standpoint  and as far as informational  
content  or decoding  is concerned,  conditions  with pure UVE and pure 
MVE (current  formulations  as shown in Fig. 1 C) are not qualitatively  
diﬀerent.  In our two voxel examples,  pure UVE can be transformed  to 
pure MVE by an aﬃne transformation  of voxel activities  ( Fig. 1 E). Im- 
portantly  and as expected  such linear transformations  do not change the 
informational  content  or decoding  accuracy  regardless  of which name 
(UVE or MVE) one chooses  for describing  the observed  pattern.  
On the other hand, we argue that a true coordinated  and joint multi- 
voxel code which posits functional  cross-voxel  interactions  across con- 
ditions entails changes  in higher-order  cross-voxel  statistics.  Such cross- 
voxel interaction  entangles  response  ﬂuctuations  across voxels within 
trials. This alternative  formulation  is consistent  with a more precise 
deﬁnition  which suggests  that a ‘true’ population  code should be rep- 
resented  in coordinated  activity  between  members  within a given trial 
and not just their mean across trials ( Elsayed  and Cunningham,  2017 ). 
2.2. MVE vs sMVE 
In theory, arbitrary  interactions  between  any number  of voxels can 
be considered  resulting  in higher-order  interaction  (between  2 and ‘N’ 
voxels) however  correct estimate  of such higher-order  terms suﬀers from 
the curse of dimensionality  and requires  increasingly  larger amounts  of 
data. The least amount  of complexity  that still goes beyond  mean eﬀects 
is to consider  pairwise  covariance  of voxel activations  (sMVE).  
Thus, for a condition  indicator  𝑥 and two voxels 𝑣 1 and 𝑣 2 , formulat-  
ing the decoding  as a simple additive  model with a pairwise  interaction  
term can be written  as: 
𝑥 = 𝑎 1 𝑣 1 ⏟⏟⏟
UVE + 𝑎 2 𝑣 2 ⏟⏟⏟
UVE ⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟
MVE + 𝑏 ( 𝑣 1 ×𝑣 2 ) 
⏟⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏟
sMVE + 𝑐 + 𝜖. (1) 
where 𝑐and 𝜖are constant  and residuals,  respectively.  
Note that the classical  MVPA follows  basically  the same model 
but without  the interaction  term 𝑏 ( 𝑣 1 ×𝑣 2 ) . Each term 𝑎 1 𝑣 1 or 𝑎 2 𝑣 2 in 
Eq. (1) can be considered  UVE while the sum ( 𝑎 1 𝑣 1 + 𝑎 2 𝑣 2 ) can be con- 
sidered  MVE which is examined  by MVPA and nevertheless  has the same 
nature of information  as the UVE terms. On the other hand, the term 
𝑏 ( 𝑣 1 ×𝑣 2 ) which represents  the second-order  interaction  eﬀect can be 
considered  as the simplest  form in which coordinated  activity  across 
voxels may be used for discrimination  of two conditions.  This is the 
term that we refer to as second-order  MVE (sMVE).  The expected  value 
of this second-order  interaction  is the covariance  matrix of voxels in the 
searchlight  provided  that the activations  are all mean subtracted.  Signif- 
icant changes  in the covariance  matrix can reveal additional  information

sMVE. (B) A sample matrix of voxels in conditions  A and B with patches corresponding  to the four diﬀerent  scenarios  in A. (C) Crossnobis  distance  correctly  detects

in the voxels about the diﬀerent  conditions  beyond  their mean activa- 
tion. Thus, in sMVE, the discrimination  of conditions  depends  on how 
well the covariance  structure  of the data varies across conditions.  
There are diﬀerent  ways to measure  MVE including  examining  the 
accuracy  of classiﬁcations  ( Pereira  et al., 2009 ) or the continuous  dis- 
tance measures  such ( Walther  et al., 2016 ). In this study, squared  cross- 
validated  Mahalanobis  distance  that is also known as Crossnobis  dis- 
tance is used to extract the strength  of MVE ( Nili et al., 2020; Walther  
et al., 2016 ) (Fig. S1). Notably,  while classiﬁcation  accuracy  is a discrete  
measure  and saturates  at 100%, the Crossnobis  distance  is a continu-  
ous and non-saturating  measure  and thus allows for better diﬀerentia-  
tion of cases with very high classiﬁcation  accuracies  ( Hebart and Baker, 
2018; Walther  et al., 2016 ). To extract sMVE, Geodesic  distance  that is 
a geometry-aware  approach  to compare  covariance  matrices  is applied  
( Pennec  et al., 2006 ) (Fig. S2) (see Section  4 for more details).  
Fig. 2 A illustrates  a simpliﬁed  view of MVE and sMVE for two voxels 
in four diﬀerent  scenarios  using simulated  data. If the covariance  ma- 
trices of two conditions  are diﬀerent  (scenarios  2 and 3), then there is 
sMVE and if the mean activities  are diﬀerent,  then there is MVE (sce- 
narios 1 and 2). Fig. 2 B shows one sample in two contexts  (say 𝐴 and 𝐵) 
across matrix of voxels with 4 sub-patches  (each consisting  of 9 voxels) 
coding the conditions  𝐴 and 𝐵with MVE only (subpatch  #1), sMVE only 
(subpatch  #3), MVE+sMVE  (subpatch  #2) or no coding (subpatch  #4) 
same as the scenarios  considered  in Fig. 2 A. As can be seen in this proof 
of concept  simulation,  Crossnobis  and Geodesic  distances  showed  diﬀer- ential sensitivity  to subpatches  with MVE and sMVE coding,  respectively  
( Fig. 2 C).

ferent types of internal  cognition  involve  speciﬁc  brain networks.  For ex- 
ample, though visual and auditory  imagery  both involve  the activation  
of transmodal  networks  such as the DMN ( Zvyagintsev  et al., 2013 ), they 
also involve  the activation  of modality  speciﬁc  networks  ( Ganis et al., 
2004 ; Pearson  et al., 2015 ; Yoo et al., 2001 ). That diﬀerent  types of 
internal  cognition  involves  speciﬁc  brain networks  was perhaps  most 
directly  demonstrated  by Shirer and colleagues,  who showed  that func- 
tional magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) connectivity  patterns  very 
reliably  distinguished  mental arithmetic,  episodic  memory  and recall 
( Shirer et al., 2012 ). 
Taken together,  these EEG and fMRI studies demonstrate  that during 
internal  cognition  (1) brain responses  to the external  stimuli decrease  
and (2) speciﬁc  brain networks  are activated  for diﬀerent  types of inter- 
nal cognition.  What remains  unclear  is how these two ﬁndings  relate. 
To understand  this, we need to link the reduction  in brain responses  to 
the external  stimuli with the speciﬁc  changes  in brain connectivity  that 
are associated  with the diﬀerent  types of internal  cognition  . 
Here we propose  a framework  that links stimulus  responses  to con- 
nectivity  between  brain areas. The framework  is based on three quanti-  
ties (1) External  Stimulus  Strength  (ESS), which reﬂects  the strength  of 
the stimulus  response  in each brain area (2) External  Stimulus  Connec-  
tivity (ESC), which reﬂects  connectivity  between  brain areas due to the 
stimulus  responses  and (3) Functional  Connectivity  (FC), which reﬂects  
connectivity  both due to the stimulus  response  and due to internal  (i.e. 
stimulus  independent)  activity.  The three quantities  allow us to address  
perceptual  decoupling  in a principled  manner.  Speciﬁcally,  we hypoth-  
esized that during external  cognition  stimulus  responses  will be strong 
(high ESS) and connectivity  between  brain areas will largely reﬂect stim- 
ulus responses.  In this case ESC will be similar (or coupled)  to FC. During 
internal  cognition  however,  stimulus  responses  will be attenuated  (low 
ESS) and connectivity  between  brain areas will largely reﬂect internal  
processing.  In this case, ESC will be decoupled  from FC ( Figure 1 A). 
To test this, we conducted  a proof-of-concept  experiment  in which 
we measured  whole brain activity  using functional  magnetic  resonance  
imaging  (fMRI) while subjects  engaged  in either external  or internal  
cognition.  Speciﬁcally,  we presented  subjects  with naturalistic  audiovi-  
sual stimuli and instructed  them to either engage in an external  task 
(pay attention  to the stimuli)  or engage in one of three diﬀerent  inter- 
nal tasks –mental  arithmetic,  recall or imagery.  We chose these internal  
tasks based on previous  studies ( Ki et al., 2016 ; Shirer et al., 2012 ) and 
because  their qualitatively  diﬀerent  nature is likely to involve  distinct  
functional  connectivity  patterns  ( Figure 1 B, see Methods  for details).  
We analyzed  the fMRI data by operationalizing  the three quantities.  
We calculated  ESS as the Pearson  correlation  coeﬃcient  between  the 
time courses  in the same brain area across repeated  presentations  of the 
stimulus,  an approach  inspired  by encoding  studies ( Huth et al., 2012 , 
2016 ). To calculate  ESC we were inspired  by recent developments  in 
inter-subject  and intra-subject  correlation  analysis  and calculated  the 
correlation  between  the time course in one brain area in a given trial and 
the time course in another  brain area and a diﬀerent  trial( Regev et al., 
2019 ; Simony  et al., 2016 ; Strappini  et al., 2019 ; Wilf et al., 2015 ). 
We calculated  FC in the usual way, as the correlation  between  the time 
courses  across areas in the same trial. Together,  these deﬁnitions  of 
ESC, ESS and FC provide  a simple (mere correlations  within/across  tri- 
als/areas)  and readily interpretable  operationalization  of our conceptual  
framework  ( Figure 1 C, see Methods  for details).  
2. Methods  
2.1. Subjects  
We recruited  24 subjects  for the fMRI study. Two subjects  opted out 
before completing  the experiment  and two were rejected  from analy- 
sis due to excessive  movement  (median  framewise  displacement  > 0.2 
( Vanderwal  et al., 2017 )). Thus, we analyzed  data from a total of 20 sub- jects (9F, ages 20-37, median  27). For the behavioral  study we recruited  
a separate  group of 32 subjects  (10F, ages 20-47, median  22). 
We obtained  informed  consent  from all subjects.  The experimental  
protocol  was approved  by the ethics and safety committees  of the Na- 
tional Institute  of Information  and Technology,  Japan. 
2.2. Experimental  design 
Subjects  viewed  an audiovisual  stimulus  while engaging  in either 
an external  task or one of three internal  tasks ( Figure 1 A). We selected  
engaging  movies with narrative  structures  as we reasoned  that these 
would be the most eﬀective  at producing  reliable  and widespread  acti- 
vations.  Some of our stimuli (Single Life, How they get there and Black 
Hole) were previously  used in inter-subject  correlation  studies ( Lee & 
Chen, 2021 ). Further,  we monitored  for wakefulness  via an in-scanner  
camera  that provided  clear view of the subjects’  eyes and allowed  the 
participants  a 1-2 minute break to recuperate  between  trials if they 
chose to do so. 
For the external  task, subjects  were instructed  to pay careful atten- 
tion to the audiovisual  stimulus.  In the internal  tasks, subjects  were 
instructed  to try to ignore the stimulus  and either imagine  their next 
holiday  (imagine),  recall their daily trip to work or school (recall)  or 
count backwards  from 2000 in steps of 7 (arithmetic).  For the imagine  
task, subjects  were explicitly  instructed  to imagine  a holiday  that has 
not yet occurred,  otherwise  subjects  may recall a previous  holiday.  For 
the internal  tasks, subjects  were also instructed  to (1) perform  all tasks 
in their head (as opposed  to out loud), (2) recall and imagine  in as much 
detail as possible  and (3) continue  as best they can in case of a mistake  
or lapse in attention.  For all tasks, subjects  were also instructed  to keep 
their eyes open and ﬁxated.  
We chose the arithmetic  and recall tasks because  they have been 
used in other studies ( Ki et al., 2016 ; Shirer et al., 2012 ). We added the 
imagine  task as a future-oriented,  divergent  form of internal  cognition.  
Together,  the three tasks reﬂect qualitatively  diﬀerent  types of internal  
cognition.

ages typically  have dynamic  imaging  appearances  and low tissue con- 
trast ( Prastawa  et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2007 ), espe- 
cially for the 6-month-old  brain ( Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018 ), 
which signiﬁcantly  degrade  the registration  performance  when align- 
ing individual  images into the common  space. Thus, it is highly desired  
to have a 4D infant brain atlas with densely  sampled  time points and 
high spatial resolution  to characterize  detailed,  age-related  anatomical  
patterns.  
Few pioneering  infant brain volumetric  atlases have been con- 
structed.  ( Shi et al., 2011 ) combined  HAMMER  registration  methods  
( Shen and Davatzikos,  2002; Wu et al., 2010 ) with a group-wise  regis- 
tration strategy  ( Wu et al., 2012 ) to create spatiotemporal  infant atlases 
at 3 time points, i.e., 1-month,  12-month,  and 24-month  from 95 infants.  
( Kuklisova-Murgasova  et al., 2011 ) built probabilistic  atlases from the 
segmentation  maps of 153 neonates  from 29 to 44 weeks gestational  age 
(GA). ( Oishi et al., 2011 ) hierarchically  used aﬃne and nonlinear  reg- 
istration  methods  to construct  an infant brain atlas from 33 neonates  
between  37 and 53 weeks postmenstrual  age (PMA).  ( Fonov et al., 
2009 ) created  an atlas with age ranging  from birth to 4.5 years based 
on the NIH pediatric  database  using a nonlinear  unbiased  registration  
framework.  ( Akiyama  et al., 2013 ) proposed  a typical 6-month-old  in- 
fant atlas from 60 infants with chronological  age between  177 and 230 
days. ( Zhang et al., 2016 ) proposed  spatiotemporal  atlas at every three 
months  in the ﬁrst postnatal  year using longitudinal  scans from 35 in- 
fants with age ranging  from 1-month  to 12-month.  ( Schuh et al., 2018 ) 
published  spatiotemporal  neonatal  brain atlas based on the Developing  
Human  Connectome  Project (dHCP)  dataset ( Makropoulos  et al., 2018 ), 
which involved  275 neonates  from 35 to 44 weeks PMA. We brieﬂy 
summarized  the recently  published  infant brain atlases in Table 1 . As 
can be seen from the table, the volumetric  spatiotemporal  infant atlases 
from birth to 2 years of age are still rarely available,  and few existing  
ones were generated  based on few participants,  low spatial resolution,  
and sparse temporal  points, leading  to degraded  accuracy  of subsequent  
analyses.  
In this paper, we propose  to construct  a 4D volumetric  atlas us- 
ing a total of 542 high-quality  infant brain MR scans from 240 sub- 
jects acquired  by a large longitudinal  infant brain dataset,  i.e., the 
UNC/UMN  Baby Connectome  Project (BCP) ( Howell  et al., 2019 ). Our 
atlas densely  covers the dynamic  brain development  during the ﬁrst two 
years with 17 time points (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 
15, 18, 21, and 24 months)  and comprises  of four components:  (1) the 
group-representative  T1w and T2w images;  (2) the tissue probability  
maps (TPMs)  for each tissue type; (3) the tissue segmentation  maps 
(TSMs);  and (4) the popularly-used  Desikan  cortical  parcellation  map 
( Desikan  et al., 2006 ) and manually  delineated  subcortical  labels. To 
mitigate  the potential  bias introduced  by the hard threshold  age group- 
ing, we applied  a sliding-window  strategy  to consider  the subjects  from 
the neighboring  ages at each time point. To improve  the registration  
performance,  we ﬁrst applied  the infant brain extraction  and analysis  
toolbox  (iBEAT V2.0 Cloud) ( Wang et al., 2018 ) to segment  each scan 
into three tissue types and manually  checked  the achieved  TPMs. Then, 
both the high-quality  TPMs and the fuzzy intensity  images were com- 
bined to align all images into the common  space using the symmetric  group-wise  normalization  (SyGN)  approach  ( Avants et al., 2010 ), which 
is widely used in brain atlases building  for human ( Alexander  et al., 
2017; Dong et al., 2019 ) and non-human  primates  ( Love et al., 2016 ). 
To achieve  consistent  cortical  region labeling  in both infant and adult 
brain images,  we mapped  the widely used Desikan  cortical  parcellation  
map to each age-speciﬁc  atlas and also manually  delineated  the typical 
subcortical  structures.  To the best of our knowledge,  our 4D infant atlas 
encodes  the largest number  of high-quality  infant brain MR images and 
achieves  the densest  temporal  sampling.  
The organization  of the paper is as follows.  The atlas construction  is 
detailed  in Section  II. In Section  III, we qualitatively  and quantitatively  
evaluated  the performance  of the proposed  atlas, and compared  them 
with the state-of-the-art  atlases.  In Section  IV, we highlighted  the nov- 
elty and signiﬁcance  of our atlas and discussed  future works. Finally,  
we concluded  in Section  V. 
2. Materials  and methods  
The proposed  framework  for building  the 4D infant brain volu- 
metric atlas is shown in Fig. 1 . First, all the images were prepro-  
cessed and segmented  using an infant brain dedicated  toolbox  iBEAT 
V2.0 Cloud ( Wang et al., 2018 ) ( http://www.ibeat.cloud/  ). Next, the 
achieved  TPMs along with T1w and T2w images were further input into 
the SyGN atlas construction  algorithm  ( Avants et al., 2010 ) to build the 
templates  at each time point. Finally,  the widely-used  Desikan  cortical  
parcellation  map in FreeSurfer  was mapped  to all the templates,  and the 
subcortical  structures  were also manually  delineated.  In total, 542 MRI 
scans from 240 term-born  subjects  (128 females  and 112 males) up to 
26 months  of age were utilized  for atlas construction.  The number  of 
subjects  at each scan age and the longitudinal  distribution  of the scans 
are illustrated  in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , respectively.  
2.1. Participants  and image acquisition  
All MR images used for constructing  our infant brain atlas are from 
the public BCP dataset,  and all participants  were recruited  from a broad 
community  to ensure the sample approximates  the racial/ethnic  and 
socioeconomic  diversity  of the US census.  
During the data collection  procedures,  the inclusion  criteria  for en- 
rolling children  are as follows:  1) born from 37 to 42 weeks GA, 2) at 
an appropriate  birth weight matching  to the GA, and 3) free of major 
pregnancy  and delivery  complication.  Children  with the following  cri- 
teria were excluded:  1) being adopted,  2) having schizophrenia,  autism,  
bipolar  disorder,  or intellectual  disability,  3) having any medical  or ge- 
netic conditions  related to growth,  development,  or cognition,  4) having 
any MRI contraindication,  5) maternal  alcohol  or illicit drug use, placen-  
tal abruption,  maternal  pre-eclampsia,  and maternal  HIV status during 
pregnancy.  More details of enrolling  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  can 
be found in ( Howell  et al., 2019 ). 
BCP MR images were acquired  on two 3T Siemens  Prisma MRI scan- 
ners located  at the Biomedical  Research  Imaging  Center (BRIC) at the 
University  of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill (UNC site) and the Cen- 
ter for Magnetic  Resonance  Research  (CMRR)  at the University  of Min- 
nesota (UMN site), respectively.  To mitigate  the harmonization  problem

of data acquired  at two sites, the model of scanners  is the same, and both 
scanners  use the same Siemens  32 channel  head coils and imaging  pro- 
tocol. Meanwhile,  two sites used the same criteria  to recruit and enroll 
subjects  and performed  the same imaging  procedures  and quality con- 
trol criteria  (i.e., excessive  motion,  insuﬃcient  coverage,  and ghosting  
( Howell  et al., 2019 )). All scans were acquired  while the infants were 
naturally  sleeping,  and their heads were secured  in a vacuum  ﬁxation  
device with ear protection.  We used both T1w and T2w images,  which 
were acquired  to provide  anatomical  information  regarding  brain struc- 
tural development,  to build our atlas. All T1w and T2w images have 
undergone  visual inspection  for quality control.  Both T1w and T2w im- 
ages had a resolution  of 0 . 8 ×0 . 8 ×0 . 8 𝑚𝑚 3 and were acquired  with 208 
sagittal  slices using the following  parameters,  respectively:  TR/TE = 
2400/2.24  𝑚𝑠 and TR/TE = 3200/564  𝑚𝑠 . 
In total, at the time of performing  atlas construction,  there were 775 
scans from 306 subjects  acquired  within the age range from birth to 26 months.  All structural  MR images were visually  checked  by the experts  
after the image acquisition  to assess the excessive  motion,  insuﬃcient  
coverage,  and ghosting.  After the quality control,  there remained  674 
scans. 
2.2. Image preprocessing  and tissue segmentation  
All images were preprocessed  using the infant brain extraction  and 
analysis  toolkit (iBEAT V2.0 Cloud) ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Speciﬁcally,  N3 
bias ﬁeld correction  ( Sled et al., 1998 ) was ﬁrstly performed  on all im- 
ages for intensity  inhomogeneity  correction.  Then, an infant-dedicated  
learning-based  method  ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) was used for skull-stripping.  
Subsequently,  for each subject,  the T2w image was rigidly aligned  onto 
the corresponding  T1w image using FLIRT in FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ). In addition,  the FLIRT-based  rigid registration  was performed  on 
all the BCP MR images to align them to the corresponding  age-speciﬁc

terminates  in the anterior  nucleus  of the thalamus,  can also be readily 
visualized  and is a target for treatment  of epilepsy  ( Grewal  et al., 2018 ; 
Schaper  et al., 2020 ). 
Recent advances  in ultra-high  ﬁeld MRI have led to United States 
Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) approval  of 7T scanners  for clinical  
imaging  ( Burkett  et al., 2021 ; Trattnig  et al., 2018 ; Vargas et al., 2018 ). 
Due to the increased  signal at ultra-high  ﬁeld, application  of FGATIR  
at 7T may allow higher spatial resolution,  better DBS targeting  accu- 
racy, and discovery  of new biomarkers  not visible at conventional  ﬁeld 
strengths  ( Maruyama  et al., 2019 ). Pulse sequence  parameters  play a vi- 
tal role in image quality.  However,  optimization  of FGATIR  parameters  
on 7T is a challenging  problem,  due to its multi-parametric  nature (i.e., 
multiple  factors,  including  repetition  time, inversion  time, acquisition  
ﬂip angle, and bandwidth,  all contribute  to image contrast),  as well as 
the need to maximize  GM signal while eﬀectively  suppressing  WM. This 
is further complicated  by the severe transmit  ﬁeld (B1 + ) inhomogeneity  
on 7T ( Barisano  et al., 2019 ; Burkett  et al., 2021 ; van der Kolk et al., 
2013 ; Vargas et al., 2018 ). As will be demonstrated,  unwitting  choice of 
parameters  can lead to reversed  image contrast,  which presents  a chal- 
lenge on utilizing  FGATIR  for DBS targeting.  Although  parallel  transmit  
technique  ( Deniz, 2019 ; Katscher  and Bornert,  2006 ) may alleviate  the 
B1 + inhomogeneity  issues, it has not been FDA-approved  for clinical  
use. Additionally,  there are remaining  challenges  to be fully addressed,  
such as safety issues related to heat deposition  ( Zelinski  et al., 2008 ; 
Zhu, 2004 ). 
In this work, we propose  a systematic  approach  to optimize  FGATIR  
sequence  on 7T MRI aiming at improving  image contrast  and reduc- 
ing the negative  eﬀect of B1 + inhomogeneity.  After introducing  a new 
framework  for sequence  optimization  by formulating  it into a con- 
strained  optimization  problem,  we describe  how it can be modiﬁed  to 
account  for the eﬀect of B1 + inhomogeneity,  while improving  GM to 
WM contrast.  We then demonstrate  how this approach  can improve  de-

2. Theory  
2.1. FGATIR  optimization  without considering  B1 + inhomogeneity  
The goal of pulse sequence  optimization  in this work is to select a 
combination  of sequence  parameters  that provides  optimal  image char- 
acteristics  for a desirable  resolution,  ﬁeld of view (FOV), and the total 
imaging  time pre-determined  based on the application  at hand. Such a 
process  can be formulated  into a multi-variable  numerical  optimization  
problem  with parameters  including  repetition  time (TR), inversion  time 
(TI), excitation  ﬂip angle (FA), and receive  bandwidth  (BW) as input 
variables.  The optimal  parameters  can be deﬁned  as those which max- 
imize an objective  function  representing  certain desirable  image char- 
acteristics.  With FGATIR,  a saturated  WM signal and a high GM to WM 
contrast-to-noise  ratio (CNR) is desirable.  Without  considering  the ef- 
fect of transmit  RF ﬁeld inhomogeneity,  FGATIR  optimization  can be 
formulated  into the following  constrained  optimization:  
{𝑇 𝑅 0 , 𝑇 𝐼 0 , 𝐹 𝐴 0 , 𝐵 𝑊 0 }= arg max 
𝑇 𝑅, 𝑇 𝐼, 𝐹𝐴, 𝐵𝑊 {

data acquisition  window  with red bar and arrow indicating  the center of acqui- 
sition window  and k-space center ( k = 0). T1 values of 1126 and 1939 msec

quisition  window,  which is aligned with the center of k-space,  is placed around

𝐵 + 
1 denotes  WM and GM signal levels in acquired  
images,  assuming  uniform  B1 + ﬁeld; 𝛿is a small constant  number  that 
controls  the relative  signal strength  of WM compared  with GM. Note 
that a small 𝛿forces WM signal to be suppressed,  which is a key fea- 
ture of FGATIR.  Based on our experience,  a value around 0.02 is suf- 
ﬁcient to limit the WM signal, and is therefore  used in this work. Too 
large of a value of 𝛿will introduce  residual  WM signal and compromise  
the contrast,  while an even smaller  𝛿no longer causes a major impact.  
𝑇 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a constant  determined  by the preset total scan time limit. For 
a given number  of total k-space  lines, the total imaging  time increases  
as TR increases.  Since longitudinal  magnetization  of brain tissues evolve 
throughout  the data acquisition  window,  the signal strengths  at the cen- 
ter of k-space  are commonly  used as surrogates  for GM and WM sig- 
nal levels in images.  Under this assumption,  the 𝑆 𝑊 𝑀 
𝐵 + 
1 and 𝑆 𝐺𝑀 
𝐵 + 
1 can 
be taken as the signal levels at the center of data acquisition  window,  
which is aligned  with the k-space  center, and can be calculated  through  
Bloch equation  simulation  based on the sequence  parameters  being used 
(i.e., TR, TI, FA, BW) as described  in ( Deichmann  and Haase, 1992 ) and 
( Marques  et al., 2010 ). Details of the signal expressions  of WM and GM 
are given in Appendix.  To illustrate  these concepts,  Fig. 1 shows how 
the GM and WM longitudinal  magnetizations  evolve throughout  a TR 
cycle and demonstrates  how the center of the acquisition  window  (red 
bar) is placed around the WM null point to suppress  WM signal. 
Next, 𝜎0 ( Eq. (2) ) is the baseline  image noise level, whose absolute  
value does not aﬀect the outcome  of optimization  and is therefore  set 
as 1 for convenience.  Eq. (2) . accounts  for the eﬀect of BW on image 
noise, and the CNR is scaled by √
𝑇 𝑅 to yield the normalized  CNR per 
unit scan time. 
2.2. FGATIR  optimization  with modiﬁed  objective  function  accounting  for 
B1 + inhomogeneity  
Eq. (1) assumes  uniform  transmit  RF ﬁeld and therefore  is susceptible  
to B1 + inhomogeneity.  While the inversion  pulse used in FGATIR  on 7T 
is typically  an adiabatic  pulse that is specially  designed  to be more im- 
mune to B1 + inhomogeneity,  the low ﬂip angle excitation  pulses used in 
data acquisition  are not ( Marques  et al., 2010 ). Therefore,  the actual FA 
2  S. Tao, X. Zhou, E.M. Westerhold  et al. NeuroImage  252 (2022) 119043 
can deviate  from the nominal  FA, accordingly.  As will be demonstrated,  
this can degrade  image contrast  in certain areas. 
Considering  B1 + inhomogeneity,  we adapt the FGATIR  optimization  
by modifying  the objective  function  in Eq. (1) as follows:  
{𝑇 𝑅 0 , 𝑇 𝐼 0 , 𝐹 𝐴 0 , 𝐵 𝑊 0 }= arg max 
𝑇 𝑅, 𝑇 𝐼, 𝐹𝐴, 𝐵𝑊 { 𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∑
𝑟 = 𝑟 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑁𝑅 𝐺𝑀− 𝑊 𝑀 
𝑟 ⋅𝐵 + 
1 } 
(4) 
where 𝐶𝑁𝑅 𝐺𝑀− 𝑊 𝑀 
𝑟 ⋅𝐵 + 
1 now represents  the GM-WM  CNR assuming  the ac- 
tual B1 + ﬁeld to be 𝑟 times the nominal  B1 + ﬁeld; 𝑟 denotes  the ratio 
between  the actual and nominal  B1 + ﬁeld and ranges from 𝑟 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 60% to 
𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 140% in this work (i.e., ±40% of nominal  value, with a Δ𝑟 = 5% 
increment),  which has been previously  found to cover most of brain 
volume  ( Marques  et al., 2010 ). Note that Eq. (4) explicitly  accounts  for 
the CNR in areas with B1 + inhomogeneity.  Therefore,  maximization  of 
Eq. (4) promotes  balanced  CNR among diﬀerent  areas. 
Eq. (4) , together  with Eq. (3) , casts the second optimization  problem  
with a modiﬁed  objective  function  to account  for B1 + inhomogeneity  
but using the same optimization  constraints  as before.

in more aggressive  police encounters.  With respect to new insights  on 
functional  neuroanatomy,  the video stimuli do not allow Dang et al. to 
establish  what the TPJ is responding  to. Participants  could be mentaliz-  
ing about White police oﬃcers’  aggression  towards  Black civilians  and 
consider  that such aggression  is intentional,  unjustiﬁed  and avoidable  
as opposed  to incidental,  appropriate  and unavoidable  (e.g., see Koster- 
Hale et al., 2013 ). Participants  could also be mentalizing  about the role 
of the police oﬃcer as the civil authority  of the government  and delegit-  
imize the White oﬃcer who embodies  this role. Both of these interpreta-  
tions would suggest  that the TPJ is responding  to well-studied  processes  
involved  in morally-relevant  judgments  ( Houlihan  et al., 2021 ). 
With respect to new insights  related to social psychological  research,  
the participant  sample and study design do not allow Dang et al. to estab- 
lish whether  their results generalize  beyond  White liberals  or whether  
their results are actually  justice-related  as the authors  suggest.  The par- 
ticipants  in the Dang et al. study were skewed.  They were politically  
liberal and high in internal  motivation  to respond  without  prejudice.  In 
other words, they were racially  egalitarian  Whites.  A wealth of evidence  
shows that White liberals  in the U.S. —particularly  those high in inter- 
nal motivation  to respond  without  prejudice  —d i ﬀ e r  from their more 
conservative  counterparts  in that they genuinely  desire racial equality  
( Kteily et al., 2017 ). Desire for racial equality  aﬀects who they include  or 
exclude  from their social groups,  who they extend empathy  to, which 
social policies  they support,  whose voices they amplify  (i.e., on their 
Twitter  accounts)  and the degree of inequality  that they perceive  in so- 
ciety ( Iyengar,  and Hahn, 2009 ; McClanahan  et al., 2019 ; Shi et al., 
2017 ; Sidanius  et al., 2017 ). White liberals  also diﬀer from their conser-  
vative counterparts  in socio-cognitive  attentional  biases involving  racial 
inequality  —they  are more likely to automatically  attend to bias in pro- 
cedures  that discriminate  against  racial minorities  when biased proce- 
dures are present  ( Waldfogel  et al., 2021 ). 
In Study 1, White liberal participants  could be genuinely  empathiz-  
ing with Black civilians  in the videos or genuinely  considering  whether  
the White oﬃcers  in the videos acted unjustly.  Both are consistent  with 
the interpretation  promoted  by Dang et al. that for these participants,  
mentalizing  involves  considerations  about injustice.  If either of these 
interpretations  were true, it raises the question  of whether  these eﬀects 
generalize  beyond  liberal Whites.  Alternatively,  White liberal partici-  
pants could be mentalizing  about White Americans  as prototypically  
advantaged  and Black Americans  as prototypically  disadvantaged.  Ac- 
cumulating  evidence  in social psychology  shows that liberal Whites 
continue  to harbor indirect  forms of racial bias ( Dupree  et al., 2021 ; 
Roberts  and Rizzo, 2021 ). White liberals  have been shown to engage 
in race-status  associations  —a phenomenon  where third-party  observers  
cognitively  bind White Americans  with high status and Black Americans  
with low status ( Dupree  et al., 2021 ). This is consistent  with the interpre-  
tation that for these participants,  mentalizing  involves  considerations  
about stereotypic  attributes  and status reinforcing  hierarchies.  Because  
race-status  associations  are sensitive  to social contexts  ( Dupree  et al., 
2021 ), videos with greater levels of aggression  may have cued these 
more pernicious  associations.  
Research  at the nexus of two or more sub-areas  in psychology  face 
similar challenges.  In many respects,  the points we raise are not new. 
Investigators  tend to respond  to concerns  such as the ones that we raise 
here by inviting  key stakeholders  –members  of the police profession  or 
the judiciary,  for instance  –t o collaborate.  Editors respond  to journal  
level critiques  by calling for interdisciplinary  special issues that bring 
disparate  literatures  together.  Scholars  jet oﬀ (or now, Zoom in) to 
small-group  conferences  to ﬁgure out whether  there is indeed a crisis 
in one or more sub-areas.  As co-authors,  we have been part of each of 
these interventions.  They have left us both unsatisﬁed  and in search of a 
more comprehensive,  systematic,  and open science  methods  to integrate  
social psychology  and social neuroscience  research.  In the remainder  of 
this commentary  we suggest  a novel path to integrate  social psychol-  
ogy and social neuroscience  when research  focuses  on justice related 
research.  2. How to move forward:  accelerating  the integration  between  
social psychology  and social neuroscience  
One unanswered  question  we are left with is: how does brain function-  
ing support the understanding  of complex  social interactions?  To answer this 
question,  we need to ask: what makes a social interaction  more or less com- 
plex? Dang et al. follow the classical  neuroscientiﬁc  approach  that maps 
concepts  from the psychological  literature  (e.g., attention  ) onto distinct  
brain areas. This approach  has led to the crystallization  of mental func- 
tions and associated  brain structures  that are, at a closer look, often over- 
lapping  (the most evident  case being the conceptual  similarities  between  
attention,  cognitive  control,  executive  control,  executive  functions,  working  
memory  and associated  fronto-parietal  neural substrates;  see Toba et al., 
preprint  ). Many authors  (e.g., Pessoa et al., 2021 ; Buszaki  2020 ) are 
challenging  this traditional  neuroscientiﬁc  approach.  Terms used to de- 
scribe cognitive  constructs  are often ambiguous  and used interchange-  
ably; sometimes  they refer to similar processes  and overlapping  neural 
mechanisms,  and sometimes  they do not. Often, this approach  has led to 
reverse  inferences,  with the activation  of a brain region (e.g., the TPJ) 
being used to infer the presence  a speciﬁc  cognitive  process  (e.g., men- 
talizing ). There is a need to identify  a lower dimensional  space between  
social psychology  and social neuroscience.  
A potential  way to achieve  this integration  would be to develop  a 
strong theoretical  framework  making  use of a big data approaches  that 
result in model-driven  predictions.  Speciﬁcally,  we could build an inte- 
grative social psychology-social  neuroscience  research  accelerator  that 
will serve both research  ﬁelds. This could be achieved  using the follow- 
ing two-step  process:  
Understanding  racial bias, social justice and inequality  could be 
achieved  by building  an empirically-validated,  data-driven  taxonomy  
of social psychological  processes,  where terms related to social inter- 
actions found in textbooks  and handbooks  (e.g., political  partisanship,  
procedural  justice, intergroup  relations,  policing)  can be searched  and 
results can be visualized  in terms of how they aggregate  (e.g., clus- 
ters). Authors  who are unfamiliar  with social psychological  research  
could obtain the most frequently  studied  concepts,  how they relate 
to each other, where they are published,  the contexts  in which they 
are used, and study designs  employed.  Such a taxonomy  is diﬀer- 
ent than just identifying  papers using tools such as Connected  Papers 
(https://www.connectedpapers.com/).  Our approach  would be useful 
to avoid conducting  restricted  searches  in speciﬁc  literature  subﬁelds  
(e.g., third-party  perceptions  of police-civilian  interactions).  This more 
comprehensive  approach  of using a shared taxonomy  tool for social pro- 
cesses would output terms and how they are studied  (e.g., interracial  in- 
teractions,  intergroup  contact,  downward  competency  shift) rather than 
just a single concept  (mentalization).  The next step would entail using 
this taxonomy  to look into the neural substrates  most commonly  asso- 
ciated with clustered  social processes.  
How to choose the regions  and networks  of interest,  then? As the 
number  of neuroimaging  (especially  functional  magnetic  resonance  
imaging)  studies grows, the need for meta-analytic  tools that summa-  
rize results from diﬀerent  studies also grows. Currently,  platforms  for 
automated  synthesis  of fMRI data exist (e.g., Neurosynth,  NiMARE,  and 
NeuroQuery)  but none of them are speciﬁc  to social processes,  and the 
results require  the intervention  of the researcher  to select a subset of 
the data. Creating  a shared tool for meta-analyses  of the social neu- 
roscientiﬁc  literature  would allow for choosing  the local and network  
patterns  of neural activity  from model-based  predictions  driven by the 
taxonomy.  
We believe  that this two-step  approach  —( 1 ) develop  a taxonomy  
rooted in social psychological  literature  ; and, (2) create a shared tool 
for regions  and networks  selection  —would  advance  the ﬁeld by accel- 
erating the integration  of diﬀerent  levels of investigation  of social pro- 
cesses. The existence  of a data-driven  taxonomy  could reduce (if not 
avoid) the chances  of restricting  the analyses  of interest  to a subset of 
processes  and neural structures.  Instead,  using this taxonomy  would al-

low researchers  such as Dang et al. to dig deeper into the plethora  of 
socio-cognitive  processes  involved  in the bystander  perspective  of the 
inter/intra-racial  interactions  shown in the videos and provide  addi- 
tional insights  about the neural mechanisms  supporting  them.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5140, 5143), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(10176, 10180), match=' \n3.'>"

2018 ; Proklova  et al., 2016 , 2019 ). Moreover,  humanness  has com- 
monly been measured  using rating scales (e.g., Contini  et al. 2020 ) 
which may not reveal subtle diﬀerences  between  objects.  Here we ad- 
dress these issues by testing separately  the contribution  of perceptual  
and conceptual  features  of humanness  to the organisation  of object 
representations  in the human visual system,  using a two-alternative  
forced choice task. Instructions  were manipulated  to guide behavioural  
choices  towards  speciﬁc  features,  in contrast  to related previous  work 
that used very diﬀerent  tasks to measure  the diﬀerent  features  (e.g., 
Thorat et al. 2019 ), which limits the ability to draw direct comparisons.  
We collected  human-similarity  judgements  of 200 various  object images 
from 191 participants  and compared  them using representational  sim- 
ilarity analysis  (RSA; Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008 ) to their corresponding  
neural representations  recorded  from 16 participants  with Electroen-  
cephalography  (EEG). Presented  with randomly  paired objects,  the 191 
participants  in our behavioural  judgement  task were divided  into three 
groups and asked either (i) “which  object is more similar to a human?  ”, 
(ii) “which  object looks more similar to a human?  ”, or (iii) “which  object 
thinks/feels  more similar to a human?  ”, in order to test the respective  
contribution  of overall humanness,  perceptual  humanness,  and concep-  
tual humanness  in object representations.  
2. Methods  
We used a previously  published  stimulus  set and corresponding  EEG 
data, obtained  from https://osf.io/a7knv/  ( Grootswagers  et al., 2019a ). 
For the current  study, we collected  humanness  scores in three online 
behavioural  experiments.  Data and analysis  code for the current  study 
are available  on https://osf.io/3ed8f/  . 
2.1. Participants  
Participants  were 191 undergraduate  students  at Western  Sydney  
University  (50 male, 140 female,  1 non-binary)  between  the ages of 
17 and 64 (M = 22.74, SD = 8.85). Participants  were recruited  through  
the Western  Sydney  University  online research  participation  platform  
(SONA)  and received  course credit for their participation.  Of the partic- 
ipants, 14 were left-handed  and 177 were right-handed.  47 participants  
were non-native  English  speakers  and 144 participants  were native En- 
glish speakers.  Prior to commencing  this study, participants  were pre- 
sented with an information  statement  summarising  the project and the 
requirements  of the task and provided  informed  consent.  All aspects  of 
the study were approved  by the Western  Sydney  University  Human  Re- 
search Ethics Committee.  
2.2. Visual stimuli 
This study used a previously  published  stimulus  set ( Grootswagers  
et al., 2019a ). The stimulus  set consisted  of 200 images of animate  and 
inanimate  objects ( Fig. 1 ). Stimuli  were grouped  into two high level cat- 
egories;  100 animate  objects and 100 inanimate  objects.  These two cat- 
egories were further divided  into ﬁve animate  subcategories  (i.e., mam- 
mal, human,  insect, aquatic,  bird) and ﬁve inanimate  subcategories  (i.e., 
clothing,  fruits, furniture,  plants, tools). Within the subcategories,  stim- 
uli were further separated  into 50 diﬀerent  objects (e.g., cow, kangaroo)  
with four diﬀerent  images per object ( Fig. 1 ). This stimulus  set was cho- 
sen as it contains  a large number  of objects that could be associated  with 
a wide range of humanness  judgements.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118834,"2. Hardware  for OPM interference  suppression  
Like SQUID-MEG,  OPM-based  MEG typically  takes place inside an 
MSR made of copper or aluminium  and mu-metal  (but see, Limes et al., 
2  R.A. Seymour, N. Alexander,  S. Mellor et al. NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118834 
2020 ). Current  commercially  available  OPMs operate  according  to the 
spin exchange  relaxation-free  (SERF) principle,  and are only capable  of 
measurements  in very low background  magnetic  ﬁeld levels. By con- 
trast, SQUIDS  are stationary,  have a higher dynamic  range and can op- 
erate eﬀectively  at any background  magnetic  ﬁeld level, as long as it 
remains  consistent  over time. Given these additional  requirements  for 
OPMs, MSRs for wearable  MEG applications  should be of the highest  
quality possible  without  becoming  prohibitively  heavy or expensive.  For 
example,  a recently  developed  shielded  room designed  for OPM-based  
MEG systems  (Magnetic  Shields Ltd.) has several design modiﬁcations  
to improve  shielding:  four half-thickness  layers of mu metal, rather than 
the conventional  three, with the grain of two layers turned at 90°; the 
purity of the mu metal was improved  during manufacture;  and wider 
panels of mu metal were produced  to create fewer joints. An additional  
method  for ensuring  even lower residual  ﬁelds and gradients  in MSRs 
is via degaussing.  This involves  applying  a sinusoidal  current  with de- 
creasing  amplitude  to coils wound around the shielding  material  induc- 
ing magnetic  ﬂux in a closed loop ( Altarev  et al., 2015 ), resulting  in 
magnetic  equilibration  of the MSR. 
In terms of sensor design, SERF-based  OPMs typically  possess  a set 
of three inbuilt ﬁeld cancellation  coils to automatically  null any resid- 
ual ﬁelds around the vapour cell ( Osborne  et al., 2018 ). This is common  
across most OPMs used for MEG measurements:  QZFM Gen-2, QuSpin  
Inc.; and HEDscan  TM , Fieldline  Inc. (but see Limes et al. (2020) and 
Kowalczyk  et al. (2021) for alternative  SERF-free  OPM designs).  The au- 
tomated  nulling is applied  dynamically,  but has to be optimised  for the 
sensor’s  position  and orientation  at the start of an experimental  record-  
ing. Where sensors  move from their start point through  the spatially  
varying  remnant  ﬁelds inside an MSR, the ﬁeld nulling will become  
progressively  worse. Currently,  it is therefore  advisable  that OPM exper- 
iments involving  moving  participants  incorporate  frequent  breaks into 
paradigms  so that OPMs can be ﬁeld-zeroed  and re-calibrated.  The inter- 
nal coils can theoretically  achieve  ﬁeld nulling up to ﬁelds of ± 50 nT, but 
in reality, measurement  non-linearities  are introduced  into the data at 
around ± 5 nT. It should be noted that closed-loop  OPM systems  are de- 
veloping  fast ( Fourcault  et al., 2021 ; Kowalczyk  et al., 2021 ; Sheng et al., 
2017 ) and are already  commercially  available  with a dynamic  range of 
200 nT and closed-loop  3dB bandwidth  up to 300 Hz (e.g. HEDscan  TM , 
Fieldline  Inc.). Technical  developments  in coil design have also man- 
aged to reduce cross-talk  between  adjacent  sensors  by a factor of 10 
compared  with conventional  Helmholtz  coils ( Nardelli  et al., 2020 )(. In 
terms of QZFM Gen-2 operation,  it is also possible  to dynamically  update 
the internal  nulling coils over time based on models of the static ﬁeld 
within the MSR ( Mellor et al., 2021a ). All of these methods  (to main- 
tain a zero-ﬁeld  operating  point) will increase  the dynamic  range of the 
sensors  and make OPM systems  more robust to low-frequency  ﬁeld drift 
and movement  artefacts  that degrade  calibration  values during open- 
loop measurements  ( Iivanainen  et al., 2019 ). 
Onboard  coils can also be complemented  by external  biplanar  coils 
( Boto et al., 2018 ; Holmes  et al., 2018 ) to correct for the remnant  back- 
ground  ﬁeld in the MSR, as measured  using reference  OPMs placed 
away from the participant.  The compensation  ﬁeld can be dynamically  
updated  for sites in urban environments  with time-varying  changes  
in remnant  background  ﬁelds, reducing  interference  to just ∼0.5 nT 
( Holmes  et al., 2019 ; Iivanainen  et al., 2019 ). Furthermore,  detailed  
ﬁeld mapping  of the MSR can be used to model magnetic  ﬁeld compo-  
nents and gradients  to update the compensation  ﬁeld produced  by the 
coils. This has recently  been shown to further reduce static ﬁelds to just 
0.29 nT ( Rea et al., 2021 ). However,  the use of external  custom  coils 
restricts  participant  movement  to a reduced  area of the MSR (around  
40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm with current  designs).  This may not be suitable  
for experimental  setups requiring  movement  over 40 cm, or for certain 
cohorts  who are likely to exceed this limit over the course of an exper- 
iment. To address  this issue, Holmes  et al. (2021) introduced  a novel 
matrix coil design featuring  two 1.6 m 2 planes, each containing  24 in- 
dividually  controllable  square coils. This resulted  in a much larger area of the MSR being nulled, allowing  a ""hyper-scanning""  two-person  ball 
game to be performed.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12977, 12981), match='\n2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(5229, 5234), match='  \n3.'>"

The current  study was designed  to test a sensory/neural  theory of 
dyslexia  which focuses  on the phonological  deﬁcit, Temporal  Sampling  
(TS) theory ( Goswami,  2011 , 2015 , 2020 ). TS theory aims to provide  
a coherent  sensory,  neural, and developmental  framework  to explain  
how phonological  representations  for words arise from automatic  sen- 
sory and neural processes  that are active from infancy  ( Goswami,  2020 ). 
TS theory proposes  that some of these automatic  processes,  speciﬁcally  
discrimination  of amplitude  envelope  rise times and the associated  ac- 
curacy of neural oscillatory  phase alignment  to temporal  modulations  
in speech at rates < 10 Hz, are atypical  in dyslexia  from birth. These 
sensory/neural  diﬀerences  potentially  cause speech to be perceived  dif- 
ferently  from infancy  onwards  and thus phonological  representations  for 
word forms develop  diﬀerently,  subsequently  impairing  the learning  of a 
visual code for phonology  (see Goswami,  2021 ). These sensory  and neu- 
ral diﬀerences  broadly  exhibit cognitively  as diﬃculties  in processing  
rhythm  ( Goswami,  2011 ). Here, we adopt a stimulus-driven  approach  
to identify  bands of amplitude  modulations  (AMs) in the speech signal of 
a children’s  story that match diﬀerent  phonological  units such as stress 
patterns,  syllables,  and phonemes,  and then we match these bands to 
corresponding  neural activity  in typically  developing  vs dyslexic  chil- 
dren. This novel approach  enables  a data-driven  test of TS theory us- 
ing MEG. We predicted  impaired  neural sampling  in neurophysiological  
bands corresponding  to stress patterns  and syllable-level  information  in 
children  with dyslexia.  
To identify  the AM bands that matched  phonological  informa-  
tion at diﬀerent  linguistic  levels in the children’s  story used in the 
MEG scanner,  we followed  the multi-time  resolution  processing  the- 
ory ( Poeppel,  2003 ). Acoustically,  human speech can be modeled  as a 
hierarchically-organized  rhythmic  structure  of AMs (relative  changes  in 
signal intensity)  at diﬀerent  timescales,  timescales  that are tracked  inde- 
pendently  by cortical  processes  ( Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ; Gross et al., 
2013 ; Keitel et al., 2018 ). According  to multi-time  resolution  models,  
endogenous  cortical  oscillations  entrain  or phase-align  their activity  to 
modulations  at corresponding  timescales  in the speech signal, thereby  
encoding  the diﬀerent  temporal  patterns,  and bind them together  to 
create the speech percept  ( Ghitza,  2012 ; Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ; 
Poeppel,  2014 ). By TS theory, if one or more timescales  suﬀer poor 
phase alignment,  this would have cascading  perceptual  eﬀects which 
would aﬀect the quality of the ﬁnal speech percept.  Comprehension  of 
speech requires  eﬀective  parsing  of this amplitude-based  information  on 
a millisecond  timescale.  Current  evidence  suggests  that rhythmic  elec- 
trical brain activity  (i.e., the neural oscillations)  use acoustic  ‘edges’ in 
the signal such as amplitude  rise times to track these timescales  pre- 
cisely, triggering  automatic  phase resets to align the oscillations  with 
ongoing  speech rhythms  at matching  timescales  ( Doelling  et al., 2014 ; 
Gross et al., 2013 ). TS theory originally  proposed  that this cortical  track- 
ing is atypical  in dyslexia  in the neurophysiological  delta (classically  de- 
ﬁned as 0–4 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) bands. This was expected  to impair 
the representation  of the hierarchically-organized  rhythmic  structure  of 
AMs and hence negatively  aﬀect the automatic  extraction  of phonolog-  
ical information  ( Goswami,  2011 ). 
However,  it is now recognized  that these canonical  neurophysio-  
logical bands may not map neatly onto linguistic  information  at the 
prosodic  ( ∼delta band) and syllabic  ( ∼theta band) levels. Speech mod- 
eling of infant- and child-directed  speech (IDS, CDS) based on TS theory 
has shown that there is a ‘spectral-amplitude  modulation  phase hier- 
archy’ (S-AMPH),  which for IDS and CDS maps to linguistic  units like 
stressed  and unstressed  syllables,  rhymes,  and phonemes  ( Leong and 
Goswami,  2015 ). The S-AMPH  can be thought  of as a nested and 
hierarchically-organized  structure  of AMs with the stressed  syllable  (i.e., 
the perceptual  basis for speech rhythm  perception)  at the top. At the 
next level are the syllables  (for example,  consonant-vowel  or consonant-  
vowel-consonant  combinations),  followed  by onset-rime  units (linguists  
divide syllables  at the vowel to yield onset-rime  units, as in spring, sting, 
sing). Leong and Goswami’s  (2015) modeling  showed  that these diﬀer- 
ent levels of phonology  emerge  automatically  from the acoustic  signal if one AM cycle at diﬀerent  timescales  is assumed  to match one linguistic  
unit (for CDS these timescales  were ∼2 Hz, ∼5 Hz, ∼20 Hz; Leong and 
Goswami,  2015 ). The S-AMPH  modeling  suggests  that accurate  speech-  
brain synchronization  to AM information  in the speech signal from in- 
fancy onwards  would enable the development  of an “acoustic-emergent  ”
phonological  system ( Goswami,  2021 ). According  to TS theory, this 
acoustic-emergent  phonological  system develops  diﬀerently  in dyslexia  
because  of atypical  oscillatory  phase alignment  to the slower acoustic  
information  that is important  for perceiving  syllable  stress patterns  and 
speech rhythm.  To test this theory comprehensively,  it is necessary  to 
establish  the acoustic  timescales  in any speech input that correspond  to 
linguistic  information  at the prosodic  and syllabic  levels. 
For the current  study, S-AMPH  modeling  was used for this purpose.  
The S-AMPH  approach  applies probabilistic  amplitude  demodulation  to 
modeling  the rhythm  patterning  in speech,  yielding  a low-dimensional  
representation  of the speech signal. The modeling  generates  a hier- 
archical  representation  of the dominant  spectral  (acoustic  frequency  ) 
and temporal  (oscillatory  rate ) modulation  patterns  in the speech en- 
velope ( Flanagan  and Goswami,  2018 ; Leong et al., 2017 ; Leong and 
Goswami,  2015 ). The AM boundaries  deﬁned  by the S-AMPH  model- 
ing were used to identify  various  temporal  linguistic  features  from our 
speech materials  (hereafter  stress AM rate, syllable  AM rate, a sub-beat  
AM rate [see below] and a phoneme  AM rate). This stimulus-driven  
approach  allowed  us to divide the canonical  neural oscillatory  bands 
(delta, theta, alpha, gamma)  into speciﬁc  frequencies  that matched  the 
linguistic  timescales  in our speech materials,  enabling  greater precision  
in identifying  which speciﬁc  linguistic  time scales may show atypical  
neural entrainment  in English  children  with dyslexia.  This approach  is 
also relevant  to understanding  the ‘phonological  deﬁcit’ in dyslexia  in 
other languages.  The S-AMPH  modeling  shows that speech rhythm  per- 
ception  (prosody)  depends  crucially  on the phase alignment  of slower 
AMs (centered  on ∼2 Hz and ∼5 Hz, Leong and Goswami,  2014a ). Ac- 
cordingly,  impaired  oscillatory  phase alignment  to AMs in speech at 
slower rates would signiﬁcantly  aﬀect the perception  of speech rhythm  
and consequently  the extraction  of linguistic  phonology  for languages  
with both stress-timed  rhythms  like English  and languages  with syllable-  
timed rhythms  like Spanish  and French.  
There is a growing  body of neuroimaging  data from children  
that is consistent  with TS theory(  Clark et al., 2014 ; Fiveash  et al., 
2021 ; Hämäläinen  et al., 2012 ; Kuhl et al., 2020 ; Van Hirtum  et al., 
2021 ; Vanvooren  et al., 2017 ). Children  with dyslexia  across lan- 
guages show impaired  discrimination  of non-speech  amplitude  rise 
times ( Goswami,  2015 for review),  and individual  diﬀerences  in im- 
pairment  are related to language-speciﬁc  phonological  tasks (e.g., tone 
awareness  in Chinese,  syllable  awareness  in Spanish).  Infants at family 
risk for dyslexia  show impaired  rise time discrimination  by 10 months  of 
age ( Kalashnikova  et al., 2018 ), and rise time discrimination  predicts  vo- 
cabulary  development  by age 3 years ( Kalashnikova  et al., 2019b ). EEG 
studies indicate  atypical  phase alignment  to rhythmic  speech in the delta 
band for children  with dyslexia  ( Power et al., 2013 ), as well as atypi- 
cal auditory  steady-state  responses  (ASSR) to AM white noise at multiple  
temporal  rates ( De Vos et al., 2017 ; Lizarazu  et al., 2015 ; Poelmans  et al., 
2012 ). Neurophysiological  studies using speech input show that dyslexic  
children  learning  English  (EEG), French and Spanish  (MEG) exhibit 
atypical  cortical  tracking  of the hierarchically-organized  rhythmic  struc- 
ture of AMs, focused  primarily  on the delta band ( Destoky  et al., 
2020 , MEG; Di Liberto  et al., 2018 , EEG; Molinaro  et al., 2016 , MEG; 
Power et al., 2016 , EEG). Furthermore,  a recent MEG study with neu- 
rotypical  children  also showed  the involvement  of delta and theta bands 
in speech tracking  ( Kolozsvári  et al., 2021 ). On current  developmental  
data, therefore,  it is plausible  to propose  that atypical  sensory  process-  
ing of amplitude  rise times, present  from infancy,  and associated  atypi- 
cal cortical  tracking  of the hierarchically-organized  rhythmic  structure  
of AMs at diﬀerent  timescales  in the speech signal, negatively  aﬀect 
the perception  and representation  of the speech signal in dyslexia  and 
consequently  impair the representation  of phonology.  We suggest  that 
2  K. Mandke, S. Flanagan,  A. Macfarlane  et al. NeuroImage  253 (2022) 119077 
the primarily  delta-band  deﬁcit found in these prior neurophysiologi-  
cal studies would interfere  with the required  multi-time  resolution  pro- 
cesses, which would negatively  aﬀect phonological  development.  
However,  electrophysiological  data with dyslexic  adults have chal- 
lenged this developmental  framework.  When adults with dyslexia  are 
tested with MEG or EEG, atypical  sampling  of auditory  information  
appears  more often in higher frequency  bands such as the gamma  
band ( ∼30 Hz, see Lehongre  et al., 2011 ; Lizarazu  et al., 2021b ; 
Marchesotti  et al., 2020 ). Gamma  band information  is thought  rele- 
vant to phonemic  parsing  of the speech signal, and as individuals  with 
dyslexia  learning  alphabetic  languages  exhibit diﬃculties  in learning  
grapheme-phoneme  correspondences,  an alternative  theoretical  view is 
that the core neural deﬁcit in dyslexia  relates to rapid temporal  sampling  
( De Vos et al., 2020 ; Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ; Lehongre  et al., 2011 , 
2013 ). To evaluate  this claim, data from young children  with dyslexia  
is required,  and we contribute  such data here. It is worth noting that 
( Lizarazu  et al., 2021b ) recently  tried to replicate  existing  adult ASSR 
dyslexia  studies with MEG. They reported  signiﬁcant  group diﬀerences  
in the delta band in the right hemisphere  and in the gamma  band in 
the left hemisphere,  thereby  supporting  both “slow rate ”and “fast rate ”
viewpoints.  At the same time, an adult study reported  by Lizarazu  et al. 
(2021a ) tested the mechanistic  claim underpinning  TS theory (that am- 
plitude rise times or edge onsets govern accurate  neural phase locking)  
and showed  that these edge onset processes  were indeed impaired  in 
participants  with dyslexia.  
These diﬀerences  in the literature  regarding  the temporal  rates of 
cortical  tracking  aﬀected  in dyslexia  could be explained  in part by diﬀer- 
ences in the methods  used in the studies of entrainment  ( Lizarazu  et al., 
2021b ). However,  in our view, the diﬀerences  are more likely to be 
explained  by the age of the participants.  Developmental  studies of 
reading  acquisition  along with studies of illiterate  adults have shown 
that phoneme-level  representations  only emerge  as reading  is acquired  
( Ziegler and Goswami,  2005 ). A consideration  of the child’s devel- 
opmental  trajectory,  from auditory  impairments  in infancy  through  
phonological  impairments  in toddlerhood  to reading  impairments  once 
school commences,  suggests  that the atypical  rapid (gamma  band) tem- 
poral sampling  diﬀerence  found in adults with dyslexia  may emerge  
over developmental  time. Such a pattern  would be expected  due to 
the severely  reduced  experience  of automatically  translating  graphemes  
into phonemes  that accompanies  being dyslexic  in alphabetic  languages  
( Goswami,  2015 ; Thiede et al., 2020 ). 
Consistent  with this developmentally-driven  perspective,  De Vos 
et al. (2017) reported  that a diﬀerence  in rapid-rate  sampling  (an ASSR 
to 20 Hz AM noise) in Dutch children  at family risk for dyslexia  only 
emerged  once reading  was taught. Indeed,  French-speaking  children  
with dyslexia  show enhanced  performance  in phoneme  categorization  
tasks, which would not be expected  if a rapid sampling  deﬁcit were 
present  ( Bogliotti  et al., 2008 ). The French data showed  the continuing  
perception  of allophones  by dyslexic  children.  Allophones  are the vari- 
ous phonetic  realizations  of a phoneme  in a language  that do not con- 
tribute to distinctions  of meaning.  Typically,  allophones  are perceived  
early in infancy  and then discarded,  in order to facilitate  speech compre-  
hension.  Accordingly,  it is important  to measure  phoneme-rate  sampling  
when listening  to natural  speech in children  with dyslexia,  ideally at the 
very beginning  of learning  to read before grapheme-phoneme  conver-  
sion has been automatizedized.  This enables  investigation  of whether  
the gamma  band temporal  sampling  deﬁcit revealed  by adult studies 
( Lehongre  et al., 2011 , 2013 ) reﬂects  the end state of development  of 
the reading  system or a core pre-reading  neural diﬀerence.  We provide  
relevant  data in the current  paper. 
As noted, a precise one-to-one  mapping  between  diﬀerent  levels of 
linguistic  information  in natural  speech stimuli and canonical  neural 
oscillations  is diﬃcult  to quantify.  Keitel et al. (2018) examined  this 
question  directly  using MEG and a sentence  listening  task and showed  
that statistical  regularities  in their stimulus  materials  emerged  for bands 
spanning  0.6–1.3  Hz (phrases),  1.8–3 Hz (words),  2.8–4.8  Hz (syllables),  and 8–12.4 Hz (phonemes).  These regularities  are notably  slower than 
classic assumptions  made in the literature,  for example,  that syllables  are 
reﬂected  in theta band neural activity  (4–8 Hz) and phonemes  in gamma  
band neural activity  (30 Hz + ; Giraud and Poeppel,  2012 ). Further,  there 
can be large inter-subject  variations  in speaking  rates ( Fosler-Lussier  and 
Morgan,  1999 ; Varnet et al., 2017 ). As both neural perspectives  (rapid 
sampling  impaired  in dyslexia  vs slow sampling  impaired  in dyslexia)  
agree that eﬃcient  auditory  processing  on a millisecond  time scale is the 
bedrock  of phonological  learning,  it is critical to compute  the statistical  
regularities  assumed  to convey linguistic  information  directly  from the 
stimulus  materials  being used in neural sampling  experiments.  For the 
current  study, we ﬁrst quantify  the modulation  content  of our natural  
speech stimuli by employing  the S-AMPH  model. The statistical  regular-  
ities in our speech materials  are then used to quantify  the boundaries  
for the neurophysiological  bands that we investigate  in our MEG data. 
For ease of interpretation,  going forward  we refer to these neurophysi-  
ological  bands in terms of the corresponding  AM rates corresponding  to 
linguistic  units in our speech materials,  as stress AM band, syllable  AM 
band, sub-beat  AM band and phoneme  AM band. 
By leveraging  on the superior  temporal  resolution  of magnetoen-  
cephalography  (MEG),  we then investigate  which brain regions  track 
the diﬀerent  linguistic  timescales  present  in human speech,  and whether  
there are diﬀerences  between  children  with dyslexia  and chronological  
age (CA) matched  controls.  Our dependent  measure  is estimated  lagged 
coherence  between  the speech envelope  and ongoing  brain activity.  
We hypothesized  that speech tracking  of various  linguistic  timescales  
would be impaired  in dyslexia,  particularly  at slower temporal  rates 
(stress AM and syllable  AM rates). Furthermore,  we investigated  poten- 
tial diﬀerences  between  the brain networks  involved  in speech tracking  
for dyslexic  and control children.  Based on prior child data support-  
ing TS theory suggesting  right-lateralized  deﬁcits  ( Cutini et al., 2016 ; 
Di Liberto  et al., 2018 ) and prior adult studies show that rapid tempo- 
ral modulations  are preferentially  processed  in the left hemisphere  while 
slower modulations  are preferentially  processed  in the right hemisphere  
( Boemio  et al., 2005 ), we predicted  that group diﬀerences  at slower 
temporal  rates would be lateralized  to the right hemisphere.  Finally,  we 
assessed  whether  the lagged coherence  and global eﬃciency  measures  
of the speech processing  network  correlated  with behavioral  measures  
of language,  phonology  and reading.  
In summary,  here we assess the developmental  TS hypothesis  by 
comparing  stimulus-driven  stress AM band, syllable  AM band, sub-beat  
AM band and phoneme  AM band neural sampling  in response  to natu- 
ral speech in children  with and without  dyslexia.  We predict that the 
primary  group diﬀerences  will be for slower sampling  rates < 10 Hz, 
consistent  with TS theory, and that any group diﬀerences  in slower sam- 
pling will be right-lateralized.  As the dyslexic  participants  had only been 
learning  to read for a short time (their average  reading  age was 7 years), 
we did not expect to ﬁnd prominent  phoneme  AM band eﬀects in the 
children  with developmental  dyslexia.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Thirty-nine  participants  took part in the present  study, which is part 
of an ongoing  longitudinal  study of dyslexia.  Children  were aged on 
average  7-8 years when the study began (2018).  The current  sample 
comprised  all those children  from the total cohort of 121 children  who 
volunteered  for neuroimaging  (two further control volunteers  were ex- 
cluded as they were signiﬁcantly  younger).  We report MEG data from 
20 age-matched  controls  (CA group) and a group of 19 dyslexic  children  
(DY group),  see Table 1 for details.  Due to interruptions  to the research  
necessitated  by COVID-19,  the CA volunteers  were slightly  younger  than 
the DY group once data collection  was completed,  even though these 
groups are well-matched  for age in the larger cohort. All children  were 
native speakers  of British English.  Children  with dyslexia  were recruited

resting-state  fMRI (rsfMRI)  studies,  the temporal  correlation  of the time 
series is generally  used to infer the strength  of the functional  “connec-  
tivity ” between  two regions  ( Biswal et al., 1995 ). However,  the local 
hemodynamic  status changes  both the magnitude  and time delay of 
fMRI signals ( Amemiya  et al., 2012 ; Qiao et al., 2017 ; Roc et al., 2006 ), 
thereby  directly  aﬀecting  their temporal  correlation  ( Amemiya  et al., 
2014 ; Golestani  et al., 2016 ; Siegel et al., 2016 ). The rsfMRI time de- 
lay measured  using the global mean or similar signal as the reference  
signal has consistently  conﬁrmed  that the delay is comparable  to that 
in dynamic  susceptibility  contrast  perfusion  imaging  in ischemic  pa- 
tients ( Amemiya  et al., 2014 ; Christen  et al., 2015b ; Lv et al., 2013 ) 
or in healthy  controls  ( Amemiya  et al., 2016 ; Tong et al., 2017 ), which 
most likely reﬂects  the regional  variance  in the local hemodynamic  re- 
sponses  ( Amemiya  et al., 2020 ). Theoretically,  such fMRI metrics  can 
be more sensitive  to altered hemodynamics  than CBF. This is because  
the blood transit time is delayed  even under the condition  where an 
increase  in blood volume  results in the successful  preservation  of nor- 
mal CBF ( Powers,  1991 ). Moreover,  since BOLD contrast  originates  in 
the veins, the rs-fMRI  time delay is ampliﬁed  compared  with the corre- 
sponding  arterial  transit time ( Tong et al., 2017 ). However,  due to a lack 
of studies examining  the reliability  of fMRI perfusion  metrics  or directly  
comparing  them with a reference  standard  clinical  examination,  it re- 
mains unclear  whether  fMRI has an equivalent  or even better reliability  
or sensitivity  to longitudinal  hemodynamic  changes.  
Understanding  the characteristics  of fMRI metrics,  including  the 
sources  and patterns  of measurement  errors, not only helps improve  
fMRI perfusion  imaging  but would also contribute  to improving  fMRI 
methodology  for assessing  neural activity,  since these share the same 
imaging  and contrast  mechanisms  that rely on local hemodynamics.  
Therefore,  this study examined  the longitudinal  characteristics  of fMRI 
perfusion  metrics,  namely  the temporal  correlation  coeﬃcient  and time 
delay computed  voxel-wise  by setting the average  cerebellar  time series 
as the reference  signal, and compared  with those of N-isopropyl-p-[  123 I]- 
iodoamphetamine  ( 123 I-IMP) SPECT-based  CBF measurement  during the 
perioperative  period in patients  undergoing  anterior-circulation  revas- 
cularization.  Since there has been no study examining  the reliability  of 
these metrics,  in addition  to the main patient study, the test-retest  reli- 
ability of the fMRI metrics  was also assessed  using the healthy  subjects’  
dataset acquired  over consecutive  days. We chose the HCP dataset that 
provides  the highest  quality data and is the subject of many studies so 
that the results can be related to those of other studies.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Theoretical  simulation  study 
2.1.1. Dataset 
To illustrate  how the temporal  correlation  of two signals changes  
with altered hemodynamics  that delay and decrease  the magni- 
tude of the signal, a simulation  study was performed  using an 
actual resting-state  fMRI (rsfMRI)  signal combined  with a varied 
amount  of simulated  noise. The signal time course was originally  
from the WU-Minn  HCP young healthy  adults (ages 22–35) S1200

ﬁcation  reﬂects  the more rapid physiological  changes  occurring  within 
the ﬁrst few weeks after giving birth, which are followed  by slower 
more gradual  changes  until maternal  physiology  reaches  pre-pregnancy  
levels at around six months  after giving birth ( Romano  et al., 2010 ).

ies, the number  of time points, as well as the number  of participants  per

than the number  of studies as many samples  overlap  or are identical  
across studies (i.e., diﬀerent  analyses  were conducted  using the same 
dataset).  
2. Applied  methods  
All 12 studies were based on structural  magnetic  resonance  imaging  
(MRI), which is suﬃciently  sensitive  to identify  changes  at the scale of 
a millimeter  and as soon as after only a few weeks. While one study 
focused  on brain size and ventricular  size ( Oatridge  et al., 2002 ) and 
another  on brain age 1 ( Luders et al., 2018 ), the vast majority  of stud- 
ies ( Carmona  et al., 2019 ; Hoekzema  et al., 2017 , 2020 ; Kim et al., 
2010 ; Lisofsky  et al., 2019 ; Luders et al., 2021a , 2021b , 2021c , 2020 ; 
Martinez-Garcia  et al., 2021 ) focused  on attributes  of gray matter (i.e., 
the brain’s tissue that contains  a mix of neuronal  synapses,  dendrites,  
and cell bodies, as well as glia cells). Two studies ( Carmona  et al., 2019 ; 
Hoekzema  et al., 2017 ) additionally  explored  attributes  of white matter 
(i.e., the brain tissue that contains  the axons and glia cells). 
There were substantial  diﬀerences  across studies in terms of the 
morphometric  approach  applied  2 , which determined  the spatial scale 
of the ﬁndings  ( Table 2 ), ranging  from global, to regional,  to local 
( Box 1 ). Global measures  include  total brain size, brain volume,  and 
1 Brain age was estimated  based on the gray matter distribution  throughout  
the entire brain using a relevance  vector machine,  as detailed  elsewhere  ( Franke 
et al., 2010 ). 
2 There were also diﬀerences  across studies with respect to the scanner,  analy- 
sis software  (software  version,  respectively),  statistical  tests, and covariates  (see 
Supplemental  Table 1).

ious regions  ( Martinez-Garcia  et al., 2021 ). In contrast,  local analyses

a broader light. At the LiveMEEG  2020 conference,  a reﬂection  on GSP was fostered  that included  explicitly  
documented  guidelines  and technical  advances,  but also emphasized  intangible  GSP: a general awareness  of 
personal,  organizational,  and societal realities  and how they can inﬂuence  MEEG research.  This article provides  an 
extensive  report on most of the LiveMEEG  contributions  and new literature,  with the additional  aim to synthesize  
ongoing  cultural changes  in GSP. It ﬁrst covers GSP with respect to cognitive  biases and logical fallacies,  pre- 
registration  as a tool to avoid those and other early pitfalls, and a number of resources  to enable collaborative  
and reproducible  research  as a general approach  to minimize  misconceptions.  Second, it covers GSP with respect 
to data acquisition,  analysis,  reporting,  and sharing,  including  new tools and frameworks  to support collaborative  
work. Finally, GSP is considered  in light of ethical implications  of MEEG research  and the resulting  responsibility  
that scientists  have to engage with societal challenges.  Considering  among other things the beneﬁts of peer review 
and open access at all stages, the need to coordinate  larger international  projects,  the complexity  of MEEG subject 
matter, and today’s prioritization  of fairness,  privacy,  and the environment,  we ﬁnd that current GSP tends to 
favor collective  and cooperative  work, for both scientiﬁc  and for societal reasons.  
1. Introduction  
The generation  of scientiﬁc  knowledge,  which is the purview  of sci- 
ence and the humanities,  relies on scientists  and researchers  using ap- 
propriate  tools and techniques,  appropriate  processes  and methods,  and 
appropriate  ways of thinking  and reasoning.  All these elements  of scien- 
tiﬁc work have been developed  and reﬁned over centuries  of discovery  
to ensure that the generated  knowledge  lives up to ever-evolving  cur- 
rent standards.  Rules, guidelines,  and principles  that codify this way of 
work are referred  to as good scientiﬁc  practice  (GSP). The details vary 
between  disciplines,  but generally  GSP serves to uphold and continue  
methodological  progress,  to make sure results are reliable,  and to avoid 
scientiﬁc  misconduct.  
In magnetoencephalography  (MEG) and electroencephalography  
(EEG), here collectively  referred  to as MEEG, the ﬁrst guidelines  for 
good practice  were published  for EEG by Donchin  et al. (1977) . They 
represented  the ﬁndings  of an international  committee  formed  to pro- 
vide publication  criteria,  which the committee  members  ﬁrst discussed  
among themselves  and then opened  up for public discussion  during 
a conference.  It was here that the recommendation  was recorded  to, 
among other things, report age, sex, and handedness  of all participants  
–something  still done to this day. Since then, this has been a common  
pattern:  new or additional  guidelines  have often emerged  from interna-  
tional meetings  or societies  where scientists  consider,  for example,  the 
need for standardization  in light of new methods,  techniques,  or ﬁnd- 
ings. 
Currently,  the most recent eﬀort in the MEEG community  to co- 
ordinate  and promote  GSP at all stages of the research  cycle has 
come from the Organization  for Human  Brain Mapping.  Their COBIDAS  
MEEG white paper ( Pernet et al., 2020) lists current  standards  and 
good practices  for data acquisition,  analysis,  reporting,  and sharing.  
Together  with numerous  other guidelines  that have emerged  over the 
years ( Donchin  et al., 1977 ; Pivik et al., 1993 ; Picton et al., 2000 ; 
Handy,  2005 ; Luck, 2005 , 2014 ; Duncan  et al., 2009 ; Gross et al., 2013 ; 
Keil et al., 2014 ; Kappenman  and Luck, 2016 ; Hari and Puce, 2017 ; 
Kane et al., 2017 ; Hari et al., 2018 ), they support  scientists  and re- 
searchers  in minimizing  known pitfalls and adhering  to best practices  
during the various  stages of research.  
Such documents  are even more important  now that the ﬁeld is 
becoming  increasingly  interdisciplinary,  and not all colleagues  will 
have had the opportunity  to be trained  in all relevant  technologies  
( Pernet et al., 2020 ). Furthermore,  recent concerns  about reliabil-  
ity in neuroimaging  research  ( Button et al., 2013 ; Poldrack  et al., 
2017 ), more pressingly  referred  to as a “replication  crisis ”( Shrout and 
Rodgers,  2018 ), have highlighted  the importance  of community  stan- 
dards –not just their existence,  but also the community’s  own awareness  
of, and adherence  to, such standards.  Therefore,  the ﬁeld of neuroimag-  ing in general  is actively  and eﬀectively  working  towards  consolidating  
GSP within its community  ( Poldrack  et al., 2020 ). 
The virtual LiveMEEG  conference  on ""Good scientiﬁc  practices  in 
EEG and MEG Research""  was held on October  5–9, 2020, with the aim 
of bringing  together  MEEG experts  to discuss essential  aspects  of GSP 
for the entire lifecycle  of MEEG research  projects.  Importantly,  what 
emerged  from this meeting  was that not everything  that is deemed  im- 
portant  is captured  by current  or previous  standards  –nor, indeed,  could 
it be: there are many subtleties  and approaches  that do not lend them- 
selves to being standardized  per se. Instead,  this diﬀerent  type of GSP 
enables  a more general  reﬂection  on the way we think and act, with re- 
spect to both the work itself and the broader  scientiﬁc  environment.  In 
particular,  ""open science""  is seen as one fundamental  aspect of modern  
GSP. This refers to a general  approach  which aims to make all products  
of scientiﬁc  work publicly  available.  Among  other things, this makes sci- 
ence less isolated,  more community-driven,  and allows the results to be 
fully reproduced  and veriﬁed  by colleagues  ( Garrett-Ruﬃn  et al., 2021 ; 
Clayson  et al., 2022 ). As we shall see, this approach  is gaining  traction,  
and many modern  recommendations  follow almost naturally  from this 
general,  open mindset.  
Our two-fold  aim here is to review existing  and developing  guide- 
lines and resources  for GSP, and to capture  those LiveMEEG  contribu-  
tions that widened  our understanding  of what GSP means. GSP is not 
merely about adhering  to established  protocols  and avoiding  mistakes:  
it involves  a more general  awareness  of personal,  organizational,  and 
societal  realities,  of the structures  that surround  and inﬂuence  us all, 
and of the future that we ourselves  wish to see on the path of scientiﬁc  
progress.  This work aims to help foster that awareness.  
1.1. How to use this paper 
Part of the nature of general  principles  is that they can be formulated  
broadly.  We do this at the beginning  of each section,  and use the sub- 
sections  and subsubsections  to provide  increasingly  detailed  GSP that 
illustrate  these principles.  To that end, each section ﬁrst summarizes  
the general  considerations  addressed  in that section,  and brieﬂy intro- 
duces its subsections.  These subsections  deal with more detailed  but still 
generally  relevant  GSP, while any deeper sections  address  concrete  is- 
sues and provide  speciﬁc  suggestions.  As such, the reader can use the 
higher levels to navigate  the paper, and choose to read those lower lev- 
els as they see ﬁt. The three main sections  of this paper, following  this 
introduction,  relate to: GSP relevant  to the early, e.g., planning  and pre- 
planning  stages of MEEG research  (Section  2); issues that arise and GSP 
that can help during data collection,  analysis,  and reporting  (Section  
3); and ﬁnally, considerations  and GSP that go beyond  the work itself, 
and touch upon ethical and social aspects  that surround  it (Section  4). 
The reader is encouraged  to look into the referenced  literature  in any 
relevant  section,  as well as Appendix  Table A1 for further resources.

Box 1 . Evolving  GSP 
GSP is under constant  evolution.  Current  GSP may not be appro- 
priate in the future, as new methods  highlight  limitations  of cur- 
rent practice.  Some examples  are: 
1 GSP for gamma-band  oscillatory  activity  measurements  has 
evolved  dramatically  after the discovery  of a microsaccadic  
spike artifact  in the EEG ( Yuval-Greenberg  et al., 2008 ) with 
energy in the gamma  frequency  range. This spike artifact  led 
researchers  to now routinely  monitor  saccadic  eye movements  
prior to drawing  conclusions  regarding  high-frequency  brain 
activity  recorded  from the scalp. 
2 Traditionally  acceptable  statistical  practices  in neuroimaging  
consisted  of selecting  regions  of interest  for further analysis  
with the same contrast  that was used to report eﬀect sizes in 
publications.  This is now a well-known  case of problematic  cir- 
cularity  in data analysis  ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2009 ; Vul et al., 
2009 ). Similarly,  the failure to account  for multiple  compar-  
isons in mass univariate  data analysis  (shown  with irony by 
Bennett  et al. (2009) , or by Nichols  and Hayasaka  (2003) ) has 
become  completely  unacceptable.  
3 Wrong uses of powerful  methods  often emerge,  especially  if 
these are successful  and widely used. For instance,  the cluster-  
based correction  for multiple  comparisons  ( Maris and Oost- 
enveld 2007 ) seems to imply a spatio-temporal  extent of the 
eﬀect under investigation  and has been used for this purpose.  
However,  this extent depends  on an arbitrary  threshold,  and 
should not be used to localize  eﬀects in space or time, as has 
been reminded  recently  ( Sassenhagen  and Draschkow,  2019 ). 
4 Similarly,  increasing  the number  of factors in a statistical  
analysis  (e.g., ANOVA)  causes an exponential  increase  in the 
number  of main eﬀects and interactions  being tested, which 
can dramatically  increase  the familywise  Type I error rate 
( Cramer  et al., 2016 ; Luck and Gaspelin,  2017 ). As a result, 
previous  advice to include  electrode/sensor  as a factor in sta- 
tistical analyses  ( Luck, 2005 ) has been replaced  by advice to 
collapse  across electrodes/sensors  unless this factor is impor- 
tant for testing the scientiﬁc  hypotheses  ( Luck, 2014 ). 
2. Early considerations  for MEEG projects  
Some general  principles  of GSP come into play even before the ﬁrst 
instrument  is picked up. These include  GSP speciﬁcally  related to plan- 
ning and pre-planning  stages of a project,  as well as GSP that is not 
speciﬁc  to any one stage, but rather reﬂects  a general  approach  to the 
project as a whole. 
During pre-planning  stages, among other things, one may be con- 
sidering  the outcomes  of previous  experiments  and how they may be 
followed  up on, or brainstorming  about experimental  variables  and ma- 
nipulations.  Here, it is important  to be aware of the limits of one’s own 
ability to properly  seek out, perceive,  and arrange  the relevant  facts. 
Section  2.1 deals with GSP related to this. It emphasizes  the importance  
of awareness,  and of availing  oneself of the expertise  of others early on. 
This latter point also applies to planning  stages, where there are a num- 
ber of beneﬁts  of sharing  project ideas with others, both before and after 
they have been ﬁnalized.  To that end, Section  2.2 explains  the various  
facets of public pre-registration.  Finally,  open science  was mentioned  
in the introduction  as a fundamental  approach  to the organization  and 
conducting  of scientiﬁc  projects.  Open science  requires  a commitment  
that impacts  all stages of research,  but many tools, guides, and examples  
already  exist to support  this, some of which are outlined  in Section  2.3 . 
2.1. Human factors 
Scientists  are trained  to form beliefs about the world and test their 
theoretical  and experimental  hypotheses  with objectivity.  However,  
even expert humans  are fallible,  as they can be victims  of their own bi- ases and, consequently,  make logical errors. GSP can help mitigate  these 
errors by making  researchers  aware of them, by explicitly  accounting  
for biases in data analysis  and representation,  and by enforcing  careful 
planning  of experiments,  with attention  to the logical implications  of 
given observations.  
2.1.1. Cognitive  biases, their manifestation,  and ways to mitigate  them 
Cognitive  biases pervade  all levels of thinking  and reasoning,  from 
low level perceptual  processes  to social representations.  Because  cogni- 
tive capacities  are limited,  humans  allocate  resources  sparingly  and cre- 
ate mental shortcuts  (heuristics)  that are prone to oversights  and biases 
( Gigerenzer,  2008 ). Of note here are the biases that cause researchers  
to perceive  or understand  information  incorrectly  during data analysis  
and viewing,  and end up drawing  inaccurate  conclusions.  We illustrate  
a few eﬀects and mention  strategies  to help overcome  these biases. 
At the perceptual  level, researchers  have to grapple  with sensory  
errors and visual illusions  both when reading  and when creating  visual 
data representations.  The limits and strengths  of the visual system for ex- 
tracting  information  from such visual representations  are well studied,  
and detailed  guidelines  exist: see Franconeri  et al. (2021) for a recent 
review.  
A prominent  example  in the ﬁeld of brain imaging  in general,  and 
MEEG in particular,  is the question  of color mapping.  Because  human 
perception  of color categories  is neither  linear nor equal across the color 
wheel ( Bae et al., 2014 ), the choice of how to represent  continuous  data 
with color is not trivial. The rainbow  color map, widely used in the ﬁeld, 
unfortunately  does not take perceptual  limitations  into account  and can 
lead to perceiving  inaccurate  steps in the data, or meaningless  categor-  
ical boundaries  ( Cooper  et al., this issue ; Borland  and Taylor II, 2007 ). 
Instead,  there are now perceptually  uniform  colormaps  that ensure that 
the linear representation  of data is correctly  perceived  by human ob- 
servers.  See Cooper  et al. (this issue) , for a review and suggestions.  An- 
other example  is how results can be distorted  when not visualized  prop- 
erly, hiding underlying  patterns  in the raw data ( Chambers  et al., 2018 ; 
Ware, 2019 ; Allen et al., 2021 ). Therefore,  it is recommended  to present  
more complete  visual representations  such as box and density  plots 
that reﬂect the entire distribution  of the underlying  data rather than 
focusing  on its central tendency  ( Hintze and Nelson,  1998 ; Rodu and 
Kafadar,  2021 ). 
Beyond  individual  perceptual  errors, other types of errors can oc- 
cur when viewing  data in a social context.  A well-known  example  is 
the “curse of knowledge  ”e ﬀ e c t ,  whereby  personal  experience  and fa- 
miliarity  with a method,  theory, or set of results make the presenter  as- 
sume more knowledge  in the audience  than there actually  is Xiong et al. 
(2020) . This is almost always the case when researchers  present  their 
own work, and may thus lead to a miscommunication  between  presen-  
ter and observer.  This disparity  may be further increased  due to the 
fact that, on the observer’s  side, their high-level  experiences  inﬂuence  
their interpretation  and even low-level  perceptual  processing  of objec- 
tive information.  This can aﬀect the reading  and understanding  of MEEG 
data, especially  when it is likely that an experimental  result strongly  sup- 
ports or refutes one’s own theoretical  predictions.  In combination  with 
the conﬁrmation  bias, the same viewer may be inclined  to ignore data 
features  that refute their own theoretical  views. There is a plethora  of 
higher-order  cognitive  biases that aﬀect decision  making  at many lev- 
els. Commenting  on all of them is beyond  the scope of the present  arti- 
cle, but their powerful  eﬀect on perception  and understanding  is impor- 
tant to consider  at all stages of a research  project.  The interested  reader 
could consult  references  such as Baron (2006) or the seminal  works of 
Tversky  and Kahneman  (1974) . 
Finally,  social factors also inﬂuence  the socio-cultural  structure  
of scientiﬁc  investigation,  and inﬂuence  scientiﬁc  progress  in a way 
that may be biased toward theories  and representations  of the most- 
represented  social groups.  The majority  of publications  in MEEG re- 
search come from Western  institutions  that recruit so-called  W.E.I.R.D.  
(Western,  Educated,  Industrialized,  Rich, and Democratic)  participants,  
3  G. Niso, L.R. Krol et al NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119056 
putting  into question  whether  these study results generalize  to a 
larger population  ( Henrich  et al., 2010 ). Researchers  must keep this 
in mind when reading  past work, designing  new studies,  and describ-  
ing their own experimental  conclusions.  Lack of diversity  and inclu- 
sion is prevalent  in academia,  and the MEEG ﬁeld is no exception  
to this ( Schrouﬀ et  al., 2019 ). Gender  bias, as well as marginaliza-  
tion and underrepresentation  of racial, ethnic, and cultural  minorities,  
aﬀect women,  BIPOC (black, indigenous,  and other people of color) 
and people with disabilities,  not only as students  and scientists,  but 
also in participant  samples.  Some relevant  resources  and concrete  ac- 
tions to mitigate  gender bias and inequity  at individual  and institu- 
tional levels in academia  have been collected  recently  ( Schreiweis  et al., 
2019 ; Llorens  et al., 2021 ; Levitis et al., 2021 ). As suggested  by 
Dworkin  et al. (2020) , Zurn et al. (2020) we have included  a cita- 
tion diversity  statement  at the end of the manuscript  for the aware- 
ness of citation  bias in the literature.  In the ﬁeld of EEG, recent studies 
have begun to address  the fact that standard  EEG electrodes  are not 
designed  to accommodate  coarse and curly hair common  in individu-  
als of African  descent  ( Etienne  et al., 2020 ; Choy et al., 2021 ). This 
is an important  reminder  that systemic  bias can also occur through  
instrumentation.  
2.1.2. Logical thinking  and fallacious  reasoning:  an example  
Cognitive  biases aﬀect perception,  cognition,  and reasoning  in sci- 
ence, but fallacious  conclusions  can also be reached  due to a failure to 
fully understand  and account  for the logical implications  of an experi- 
mental work. Logical  thinking  is at the heart of conceiving  hypotheses  
and designing  experiments.  Experimenters  need to take certain steps at 
the outset to forestall  later mistakes  when drawing  conclusions  from re- 
sults. See Sinnott-Armstrong  and Simmons  (2021) for a list of common  
fallacies  in MEEG data. 
Some common  mistakes  can be illustrated  by misinterpretations  of 
Libet and collaborators  ( Libet et al., 1983 ). In this now infamous  EEG 
experiment,  participants  were positioned  in front of a clock face, and 
were instructed  to freely move their ﬁngers or wrists at a time of 
their choosing.  When they did decide to move, they were asked to re- 
port the time when the decision  was made. As such, the experiment  
yielded  three points in time: the self-reported  time of the conscious  
will or decision  to move (W), the measured  time that movement  in- 
deed took place (M), and correlated  brain activity  in the EEG in the 
form of a readiness  potential  (RP). They found that the readiness  po- 
tential RP occurred  before the reported  time of W, which in turn oc- 
curred before M. Libet’s ﬁndings  have been replicated  often, but there 
are still raging debates  about their interpretation,  the role of the neural 
activity  (RP) and W in producing  M, and any relation  of these ﬁnd- 
ings to free will. Unfortunately,  these debates  continue  to involve  sev- 
eral fallacies  that could have been avoided  by following  these simple 
recommendations.  
First, spell out all theories  or hypotheses  that might explain  possible  
experimental  ﬁndings.  Overlooking  an option can lead to a fallacy called 
false dichotomy  . For example,  commentators  on Libet et al. (1983) of- 
ten assumed  that one of only three options  must be true: (a) W causes 
M, but nothing  causes W (Libertarianism);  (b) W causes an RP, which 
causes M (Backwards  Causation);  or (c) RP causes M, but W does not 
cause M (Libet’s  conclusion).  Libet’s followers  rejected  the Libertarian  
claim, because  they assumed  that every event has a cause. They also 
rejected  Backwards  Causation,  because  W occurs later than RP, and 
causes never come after their eﬀects. They concluded  that RP causes 
M, but W does not cause M. What they failed to consider  was the Com- 
monsense  view that RP causes W, and then W in turn causes M —that 
is, activity  in the brain causes choices,  which cause actions.  To over- 
look such a plausible  option is called false dichotomy  because  it is false 
to assume  that one member  of the original  set of alternatives  must be 
true. 
Second,  think carefully  about which theories  or hypotheses  are log- 
ically compatible  with others. Forgetting  that both of two supposed  al- ternatives  might be true can lead to a fallacy called aﬃrming  a disjunct  . 
Some readers  of Libet et al. (1983) seem to reason that either RP causes 
M or W causes M, so, if RP causes M, then W does not cause M (cf Sinnott-  
Armstrong,  2011 ). However,  this reasoning  is fallacious  because  RP and 
W might both cause M, such as when RP, W, and M form a chain of 
causes across time. 
Third, deﬁne the precise category  that the conclusion  will cover and 
include  stimuli or tasks for all variations  within that category.  Failing 
to include  a subclass  of the phenomenon  can lead to a fallacy called 
hasty generalization  . An experiment  using a speciﬁc  kind of action can- 
not justify a conclusion  about all actions,  especially  when the studied  
acts are atypical.  In particular,  Libet’s subjects  arbitrarily  chose when to 
ﬂex their wrists with nothing  at stake. What Libet found about these ar- 
bitrary,  simple,  trivial acts might not hold for important  human actions 
that are based on conscious  deliberation  and require  complex  sequences.  
If one wants to draw a conclusion  about all actions,  one must be sure to 
include  diverse  kinds of actions in the experimental  data itself. 
How can one know whether  one has included  enough  kinds of test 
alternatives,  considered  enough  theories,  and speciﬁed  competitors  that 
cannot both be true? The best way to minimize  the chances  of these and 
other mistakes  is to seek early feedback  from others, especially  those 
who disagree  with one’s views and assumptions.  This includes  people 
from other ﬁelds and backgrounds.  Working  together  instead  of alone 
is of great beneﬁt:  today’s team science  activities  have shown these ad- 
vantages  (see examples  in Section  2.3 ).

dict individual  traits. Furthermore,  we hypothesize  that predictions  of 
individual  traits using models based on these “connTask  ”m a p s would 
be more accurate  than predictions  derived  from models based on the 
rs-connectome  directly.  Thus, we suggest  a novel approach  for accurate  
estimation  of cognitive  abilities  from a simple and eﬀortless  fMRI scan, 
without  actually  performing  any task. 
To test our hypotheses,  we used the data of 847 participants  from 
the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) who underwent  resting-state  and 
several task-fMRI  scans, as well as multiple  behavioral  tests performed  
outside  of the scanner  (see methods)  ( Barch et al., 2013 ; Glasser  et al., 
2013 ; Smith et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2012 ). As a measure  of in- 
telligence,  we calculated  individual  general  cognitive  ability (G) scores 
based on 10 cognitive  tests, using a previously  suggested  factor analy- 
sis approach  ( Dubois et al., 2018b ). We selected  100 participants  with 
no relatives  in the dataset to serve as the training  set, and generated  
a variety of connTask  maps for the remaining  747 participants.  We 
then used these maps to predict individual  G-scores  using a Brain Basis 
Set modeling  paradigm  ( Sripada  et al., 2020 , 2019 ) (see methods  and 
Fig. 1 ). We predicted  intelligence  scores using either original  task ac- 
tivation  maps, connTask  maps or resting-state  functional  connectomes,  
and compared  the success  of predictions  derived  from these diﬀerent  
inputs. In addition,  we devised  models that combine  data from multiple  
task-activation/connTask  maps and compared  their success  to models 
based on a single map (see methods).  
2. Materials  and Methods  
2.1. Data and participants  
We used the data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Van Essen et al., 2012 ) for all subsequent  analyses.  The dataset includes  
functional  and structural  minimally  pre-processed  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ) 
scans (1200 subjects  release).  
We included  participants  that performed  all the relevant  behavioral  
and cognitive  tests (see G-score  construction,  Section  2.6 ), and com- pleted all the resting-state  and task fMRI sessions,  barring  the Motor 
task, which was left out of further analysis  due to its weak contribution  
to the prediction  of intelligence  ( Sripada  et al., 2020 ), and the low speci- 
ﬁcity of its connTask  maps ( Tavor et al., 2016 ). These criteria  resulted  
in a dataset of 847 participants.  
All acquisition  parameters  and image processing  pipelines  are de- 
scribed  in detail in Glasser  et al (2013) . Brieﬂy,  all fMRI data (rest and 
task alike) were scanned  with a TR of 0.72s. Each participant  included  
in this study had four resting-state  fMRI runs with a total of 1,200 time- 
points per run, and performed  all necessary  tasks fMRI scans. 
As part of the HCP’s pre-processing  procedure,  all functional  
data were de-noised  using FMRIB’s  ICA-based  Xnoiseiﬁer  (FIX) 
( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), which identiﬁes  in- 
dependent  components  of structured  artefacts  in the data, and regresses  
them out. This is the standard  method  for nuisance  regression  in the 
HCP. This procedure  ensures  that the “cleaned  ”d a t a is minimally  af- 
fected by noise sources  such as white-matter  signal or motion eﬀects, 
as these are represented  as noise components  and are regressed  out of 
the data. The “cleaned  ”data was then resampled  and “projected  ”onto 
a surface representation  consisting  of 91,282 ""grayordinates""  in stan- 
dard space. Data were aligned  and registered  using Multimodal  Surface  
Matching  (MSMAll)  ( Robinson  et al., 2018 ). 
As for the task fMRI, data provided  by the HCP were already  post- 
processed  and included  statistical  analysis.  All tasks in the HCP were 
performed  in a block-design  manner,  and activity  estimates  were com- 
puted for the time series from preprocessed  functional  scans using FSL’s 
FILM (FMRIB’s  Improved  Linear Model with autocorrelation  correction)  
( Woolrich  et al., 2001 ). “Blocks  ”of each type of stimuli included  in each 
task, were convolved  with a double gamma  canonical  hemodynamic  re- 
sponse function  ( Glover,  1999 ) to generate  the main model regressors.  
All tasks were performed  twice, and the statistical  maps provided  by 
the HCP are the result of the second level analysis,  that provides  a mean 
result for each contrast  across both runs. 
The Working  Memory  task included  405 time-points,  with 25 sec- 
onds long blocks, and 4 blocks per condition  (0-back,  2-back);  The Gam-

math and story blocks were maintained  at same length),  and 4 blocks

with 23 seconds  long blocks and 2 or 3 blocks per condition  (run 1 con- 
tained 2 Social and 3 Random  blocks and Run 2 contained  3 Social and

16 seconds  long blocks, and 3 blocks per condition  (relational,  control);  
The Emotion  task included  176 time-points,  with 18 seconds  long block 
and 3 blocks per condition  (face, shape).  
We used the Z-score  maps provided  by the HCP for all contrasts  de- 
scribed  in Table 1 with no further analysis.  Additional  details regarding  
task design and processing  can be found in ( Barch et al., 2013 ) 
2.2. Construction  of connectivity-derived  task activation  (connTask)  maps 
Connectivity-derived  task activation  maps were calculated  according  
to the method  suggested  by Tavor and colleagues  ( Tavor et al., 2016 ), 
for which all codes are publicly  available.  The procedure  is described  in 
Fig. 1 A and detailed  below. 
2.2.1. Train-test  split 
We selected  100 participants  without  any relatives  in the data, to 
serve as the training  set for the prediction  of task-induced  activation  
maps from resting-state  connectivity  data (i.e., the construction  of con- 
nTask maps). This was done to ensure that under no circumstances  an 
individual’s  connTask  map could have been created  based on a train- 
ing set which included  data from their siblings,  to prevent  over-ﬁtting  
(Colclough  et al., 2017). 
2.2.2. Feature extraction  
The feature extraction  procedure  included  four steps, designed  to 
yield a set number  of functional  connectivity  maps, to be used in the 
prediction  model. 
1) First, in order to reduce the dimensionality  and prepare  the data for 
the following  steps, all the training  set’s pre-processed  resting-state  
fMRI data were combined  using an iterative  group principal  compo-  
nent analysis  (PCA) procedure  ( Smith et al., 2014 ). This step is aimed 
to concatenate  a large number  of participants;  an iterative  PCA was 
shown to yield a very accurate  approximation  to a concatenation  
of the whole dataset while having very low memory  requirements  
( Smith et al., 2014 ). In each iteration  of this procedure,  data from 
one resting-state  scan (1200 timepoints)  were added, and the overall 
dimensionality  was reduced  to a set of 1000 group-level  components.  2) Group independent  component  analysis  (ICA) ( Beckmann  et al., 
2005 ) was performed  on the training  set’s reduced  data using Fas- 
tICA ( Hyvarinen,  1999 ), yielding  45 spatially-independent  cortical  
components  to be used as seeds for connectivity  analysis.  Five of 
these components  were manually  classiﬁed  as noise according  to 
their spatial maps and removed  from further analyses  (see Supple-  
mentary  Figure S1). 
3) Dual regression  was performed  on the cortical  components  against  
individual  time-series,  to produce  subject-speciﬁc  cortical  indepen-  
dent component  (IC) maps ( Beckmann  et al., 2009 ) for all partic- 
ipants, test and training  sets alike. In dual regression,  the ﬁrst re- 
gression  uses the cortical  group-ICA  maps as regressors  to get an 
individual  time-series  for each component  per participant.  The sec- 
ond regression  uses the individual  time-series  as regressors  to get 
individual  spatial maps. Thus, this step produces  individual  seeds to 
be used in the following  connectivity  analysis.  
4) Last, the subject-speciﬁc  IC maps were used as seeds in a weighted  
seed-to-vertex  analysis.  As such, individual  IC maps were regressed  
against  individual  rs-fMRI  time-series  in order to yield one time- 
course per spatial map. Each time course was then correlated  with 
the original  rs-fMRI  data to produce  an individual  connectivity  map 
for each IC map. In the original  work by Tavor and colleagues,  
weighted  seed-to-vertex  connectivity  maps were created  also for ad- 
ditional  32 sub-cortical  components.  Of these, we included  3 cerebel-  
lar components  that were created  through  group-ICA.  The remain-  
ing sub-cortical  components  had little to no contribution  to the pre- 
diction success,  and thus were kept out of the procedure  we imple- 
mented  in this work.

ing specialized  imaging  sequences  have attempted  to further probe tis- 
sue characteristics  even further ( Fan et al., 2021 ; Palombo  et al., 2020 ; 
Wang et al., 2014 , 2015 ; Zong et al., 2021 ). 
Early diﬀusion  imaging  studies acquired  the minimum  require-  
ment of six orthogonal  DWIs for computing  a single diﬀusion  ten- 
sor ( Pierpaoli  et al., 1996 ). With improvements  in MRI hardware  and 
software  and the demand  for more complex  diﬀusion  models,  acquisi-  
tion schemes  have increased  in complexity.  Clinical  diﬀusion  imaging  
studies typically  acquire  12–30 DWIs per patient while research  stud- 
ies typically  acquire  30–60 DWIs per participant  ( Jones and Cercig- 
nani, 2010 ). Recent large sample studies such as the Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP, ( Van Essen et al., 2012 )) and the Adolescent  Brain 
Cognitive  Development  (ABCD,  ( Casey et al., 2018 )) study, collected  
297 and 103 DWIs per participant,  respectively.  Collecting  even more 
data per individual,  through  repeated  sampling  has been informative  
for functional  MRI (precision  functional  mapping  [PFM])  ( Braga and 
Buckner,  2017 ; Gordon  et al., 2017 ; Laumann  et al., 2015 ), reveal- 
ing previously  undetected  individual  variants  in functional  network  ar- 
chitecture  ( Gordon  et al., 2021 ; Gratton  et al., 2018 ; Greene et al., 
2020 ; Marek et al., 2018 ; Newbold  et al., 2020 ; Sylvester  et al., 2020 ; 
Zheng et al., 2021 ). By analogy,  intensive  acquisition  of DWIs in individ-  
uals could be similarly  fruitful in the study of structural  brain connec-  
tivity. Prior studies have examined  the reliability  and accuracy  of diﬀu- 
sion imaging  using less than 60 diﬀusion  directions  ( Hasan et al., 2001 ; 
Jones, 2004 ). Evaluated  measures  have included  mean FA ( Jones and 
Cercignani,  2010 ; Lebel et al., 2012 ; Ni et al., 2006 ), tract-averaged  
FA ( Gordon  et al., 2018 ; Luque Laguna  et al., 2020 ), and capacity  
to resolve crossing-ﬁber  models ( Rokem et al., 2015 ; Tournier  et al., 
2013 ). Model reliability  has also been evaluated  using histological  val- 
idation ( Jones et al., 2020 ; Kuo et al., 2008 ; Panagiotaki  et al., 2012 ; 
Schilling  et al., 2018 ), in various  tissue types ( Alexander  et al., 2001 , 
2019 ). However,  it is unclear  what degree of within-individual  reliabil-  
ity may be achieved  by collecting  much larger quantities  of DWI data. 
Therefore,  we acquired  repeated  DWI scans over multiple  sessions.  
Three individuals  were scanned  on multiple  days using the ABCD study 
sequence  ( Casey et al., 2018 ). This sequence  includes  103 DWIs (96 dif- 
fusion encoding  directions;  4 b-value  shells; ∼6.5 min). A total of 9 - 
14 complete  DWI datasets  were acquired  per individual.  Diﬀerences  in 
the head position  across scans contributes  additional  variability  in an- 
gular sampling  for each subject.  Thus, repeated  scanning  with the same 
sequence  increases  both angular  sampling  and SNR. These repeated  sam- 
pling data were used to study how DWI data quantity  and analysis  meth- 
ods impact reliability  and accuracy.  We pseudo-randomly  sampled  DWI 
encodings  in a manner  that maintained  approximately  constant  angu- 
lar coverage  (see Methods;  Figure S1), to systematically  evaluate  how 
reliability  depends  on angular  sampling.  Although  earlier work has sug- 
gested that 30 spatially  distributed  DWIs could be suﬃcient  to estimate  
a diﬀusion  tensor ( Jones, 2004 ), more complex  models have not been 
similarly  tested. 
Four crossing-ﬁber  estimation  methods  were compared:  FSL’s Bed- 
postX (BPX) ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ; Jbabdi et al., 2012 ; Sotiropoulos  et al., 
2016 ) uses the ball-and-sticks  model and Automatic  Relevance  Determi-  
nation (ARD) to select the number  of ﬁber directions.  The ball-and-sticks  
model was separately  estimated  using a novel Bayesian  model selec- 
tion developed  in our laboratory  which we term Bayesian  Multi-Tensor  
Model selection  (BaMM).  The third and fourth crossing-ﬁber  estima-  
tion methods  tested here were DSI Studio’s  Constant  Solid Angle Q-ball 
Imaging  (CSA-QBI;  ( Aganj et al., 2010 ; Tuch, 2004 ), and MRtrix3’s  Con- 
strained  Spherical  Deconvolution  (CSD, ( Tournier  et al., 2013 , 2019 ), 
two of the currently  most widely used diﬀusion  processing  packages.  
As a control,  we also tested two single-tensor  estimation  methods:  lin- 
ear least squares  (LLS) and single-tensor  Bayesian  (STB) ( Basser et al., 
1994a , Basser et al., 1994b ; Lee et al., 2010 ). These six diﬀusion  mod- 
eling methods  were selected  as examples  of diﬀering  approaches  to dif- 
fusion imaging  ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ; Jbabdi et al., 2012 ; Jensen et al., 
2005 ; Tournier  et al., 2013 , 2019 ; Tuch, 2004 ; Wang et al., 2014 , 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ), but are not an exhaustive  representation.  Pertinent  
model estimation  diﬀerences  may be summarized  as follows:  BaMM and 
BPX both use a partial volume  model assuming  a variable  number  of 
radially  symmetric  ﬁber compartments.  BaMM incorporates  a model se- 
lection approach  to estimate  the number  of ﬁber compartments.  BPX 
uses automatic  relevance  determination  (ARD) to down-weight  unnec- 
essary ﬁber compartments.  CSA-QBI  is a method  derived  from Q-ball 
numerical  approximation  of the water diﬀusion  orientation  distribution  
function  (dODF)  ( Aganj et al., 2010 ; Callaghan  et al., 1988 ; Tuch, 2004 ). 
The CSD method  use a constrained  spherical  deconvolution  to estimate  
the ﬁber orientation  distribution  (FOD) ( Dell’Acqua  and Tournier,  2019 ; 
Jeurissen  et al., 2014 ). The accuracy  and reliability  of these methods  
was evaluated  as a function  of data quantity  in both real and simulated  
data. 
2. Methods  
The organization  of the present  analyses  is summarized  in Table 1 . 
2.1. Voxelwise  parameter  estimation  
We evaluated  ﬁve parameter  estimation  methods:  two methods  
(Bayesian  Multi-Tensor  Model-Selection  [BaMM]  and FSL’s BedpostX  
[BPX]) used the ball and sticks model ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ); the third 
crossing  ﬁber method  (Constant  Solid Angle Q-Ball Imaging  [QBI]) used 
spherical  harmonics  ( Aganj et al., 2010 ); and two methods  (Linear  Least 
Squares  [LLS] and Single Tensor Bayesian  [STB]) used the classic single 
tensor model ( Basser et al., 1994a ). 
2.1.1. Bayesian  multi-tensor  model-selection  (BaMM)  modeling  ball and 
sticks 
We adapted  a Bayesian  model selection  algorithm  followed  by pa- 
rameter  estimation  of the winning  model (modiﬁed  from ( Lee et al., 
2010 )). BaMM evaluated  several competing  models derived  from the 
ball and sticks model (aka one ball vs. one ball and one stick; see Eq. (1) ). 
Model selection  and parameter  estimation  used a Markov-Chain  Monte 
Carlo (MCMC),  with Metropolis-Hastings  sampling,  and simulated  an- 
nealing.  The model selection  penalty  was scaled based on the input data 
size. Additional  details on the implementation  of this model are in the 
Supplemental  Material.  
2.1.2. FSL’s BedpostX  (BPX) 
The ball and stick model, developed  by FSL ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ), is 
an alternative  to the single diﬀusion  tensor model ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ; 
Jbabdi et al., 2012 ). BPX is a multi-compartment  model, in which the 
ﬁrst compartment  models the diﬀusion  of free water as isotropic  (ball), 
and the rest of the 𝑘 compartments  model diﬀusion  along several axial 
ﬁber directions  with zero diﬀusion  in the radial direction  (sticks).  The 
predicted  diﬀusion  signal is: 
𝜇𝑖 = 𝑆 0 [(1 − Σ𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 )𝑒𝑥𝑝 (− 𝑏 𝑖 𝑑 )+ Σ𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (
− 𝑏 𝑖 𝑑 (𝑔 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑥 𝑘 )2 )]
(1) 
where 𝑖 indexes  encoding  direction  and 𝑘 indexes  compartment.  𝑆 0 is 
the signal with no diﬀusion  weighting  and 𝜇𝑖 is the signal with a diﬀu- 
sion gradient  applied  along the unit vector 𝑔 𝑖 with b- value 𝑏 𝑖 on diﬀusion  
signal 𝑑. The 𝑓 𝑘 are volume  fractions  for each ﬁber compartment.  Each 
ﬁber compartment  is modeled  as a stick-like  tensor oriented  along 𝑥 𝑘 . 
We employed  FSL’s BedpostX  6.0.0 to evaluate  BPX ( Sotiropoulos  et al., 
2016 ). The Bayesian  parameter  estimation  approach  uses Automatic  
Relevance  Determination  (ARD) to down weight unnecessary  ﬁbers. 
BPX estimates  angles 𝜃and 𝜙but not FA, MD, AD, or RD. Angles 𝜃and 𝜙
are estimated  for every direction  (indeed  by 𝑘 ). We ran BedpostX  using 
the default settings  unless noted otherwise:  2 ﬁbers, weight = 1, and 
burn in = 1000.

Fig. 1. Estimated  Tensor and Angles 
(A) Constant  Solid Angle Q-Ball Imaging  (QBI) reports ﬁfteen spherical  harmonic  
values, from which a 3D surface is estimated.  The surface is colored by the 
orientation  distribution  function  (ODF). The surface/ODF  peaks are extracted  
(black line) and angles 𝜑 and 𝜃estimated  to match in B. (B) For Linear Least 
Squares (LLS) and Single Tensor Bayesian  (STB), the tensor describing  Brownian  
diﬀusion  of water was calculated.  Three eigenvalues  are used to describe  the 
tensor shape. From the largest eigenvector,  two angles are estimated  to describe  
the tensor orientation  in 3D space. For Bayesian  Multi-Tensor  Model-Selection  
(BaMM)  and FSL’s BedpostX  (BPX), a stick corresponding  to eigenvector-1  is 
estimated  and its angles reported.

Intrinsic  neural timescales  can be measured  with an autocorrelation  
function  (ACF) that correlates  a signal with copies of itself that are tem- 
porally shifted with a series of lags ( Murray  et al., 2014 ; Honey et al., 
2012 ; SanCristobal  et al., 2021 ). The ACF therefore  indexes  temporal  
continuity  in neural activity  or the degree to which previous  activity  
predicts  future dynamics  over multiple  timescales  ( Golesorkhi  et al., 
2021a , 2021b ; Honey et al., 2012 ; Wolﬀet  al., 2022 ). A common  prac- 
tice in EEG and MEG studies is to report the autocorrelation  window  
(ACW) representing  the length of time at the moment  when the ACF 
decays to 50% of its maximum  value (i.e., ACW-50;  Raut et al., 2020 ; 
Watanabe  et al., 2019 ; Ito et al., 2020 , Honey et al. 2012 ). Worth noting, 
Golesorkhi  et al. (2021a)  introduced  a novel variant,  ACW-0,  based on 
the temporal  delay when the autocorrelation  reaches  zero. Moreover,  
they demonstrated  that ACW-0 shows stronger  prediction  than ACW- 
50 in diﬀerentiating  between  brain regions  with shorter and longer 
timescales  (i.e., core- and periphery).  An objective  of this study was 
therefore  to determine  the discriminatory  ability of ACW-50  compared  
to ACW-0 when applied  to self and non-self-speciﬁcity  given that, like 
the core brain regions,  self-speciﬁcity  exhibits  high temporal  continuity  
( Kolvoort  et al., 2020 ; Wolﬀet  al., 2019 ). 
The overarching  goal of our investigation  was to determine  how INTs 
shape task-related  activity  during the neural processing  of self- and non- 
self-speciﬁc  information.  To this end, and following  a previous  paradigm  
( Vallacher  et al., 2002 ), we constructed  8 min narratives  with self- and 
non-self-speciﬁc  contents,  respectively.  After a resting state EEG ses- 
sion, subjects  listened  to each narrative  while EEG was recorded.  Lis- 
tening to these narratives  allowed  the presentation  of self- and non-self-  
speciﬁc  stimuli in a dynamic  (rather than static) and naturalistic  way 
that includes  distinct  timescales  in the input itself ( Huk et al., 2018 ; 
Golesorkhi  et al., 2021a , 2021b ). Consequently,  it was possible  to di- 
rectly compare  the impact of longer and shorter INTs on the neural pro- 
cessing of dynamic  self- and non-self-speciﬁc  narratives.  
Our ﬁrst speciﬁc  aim was to investigate  how subjective  behav- 
ioral evaluations  diﬀer in response  to the autobiographical  and non- 
autobiographical  stimuli.  We hypothesized  greater behavioral  variabil-  
ity in response  to the former based on recent studies connecting  in- 
terindividual  variation  to the self in psychological  ( Kolvoort  et al., 2020 ) 
and neuronal  variables  ( Huang et al., 2016 ; Wolﬀet  al., 2019 ). Speciﬁ-  
cally, we hypothesized  greater spatial extension  and faster velocity  dur- 
ing the self-speciﬁc  narrative  compared  to the non-self-speciﬁc  one. The 
larger background  here is that self-speciﬁcity  induces  a stronger  be- 
havioral  change as related to the well-known  self-prioritization  eﬀect 
( Sui and Humphreys,  2015a ). 
Our second objective  was to investigate  ACW-50  and ACW-0 during 
self- and non-self-relevant  tasks in EEG. Given that a positive  correla-  
tion was recently  observed  between  the resting-state  ACW length and 
self-speciﬁcity  ( Kolvoort  et al., 2020 ; Wolﬀ et  al., 2019 ), we hypoth-  
esized that the ACW would be signiﬁcantly  longer during self-speciﬁc  
compared  to non-self-speciﬁc  activities.  
1. Materials  and methods  
1.1. Subjects  
Twenty-seven  (10 females;  mean age = 30.3 years) healthy  subjects  
were recruited  from the local community  in Ottawa,  Canada.  Medical  
history was collected  using an in-house  health assessment  questionnaire.  
All participants  were right-handed  per the Edinburgh  Handedness  Tool 
( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ). Each participant’s  session lasted approximately  three 
hours. The experimental  protocol  was approved  by the ethics commis-  
sion (REB #2016004)  of the University  of Ottawa  Institute  of Mental 
Health Research.  All participants  provided  written  informed  consent  
prior to engaging  in any study-related  activities.  
1.2. Paradigm  
Our experiment  used a behavioral  paradigm  modiﬁed  from 
Vallacher  et al. (2002) . Participants  in their study ﬁrst recorded  an au- tobiographical  narrative  (average  2 min 52 s) and were then presented  
with that recording  during the experiment’s  task phase. Subjects  contin- 
uously evaluated  their narrative’s  contents  as positive  or negative  using 
a mouse cursor. On a moment-to-moment  basis, they indicated  degrees  
of negativity  or positivity  by moving  the cursor away from the center or 
towards  the center of the screen, respectively.  From this movement,  the 
researchers  extracted  variables  such as the cursor distance  from center 
along the x-axis, acceleration,  and time spent with the cursor station-  
ary, which were then correlated  with a small number  of psychological  
scales. 
Expanding  on this original  template,  participants  in our study 
recorded  an unstructured,  eight-minute  autobiographical  narrative.  Par- 
ticipants  were encouraged  to be as comprehensive  as possible  in sharing  
personal  details about themselves  and their lives that they deemed  sig- 
niﬁcant.  Next, subjects  completed  an eight-minute,  eyes-open  rest ses- 
sion for EEG acquisition  while staring at a ﬁxation  cross centered  on 
the computer  screen. The subjects  were then presented  with their prere- 
corded auditory  narrative  and the narrative  of a stranger  through  head- 
phones in a counterbalanced  order (see Fig. 1 a). 
The stranger,  or “non-self  ” narrative  was also eight minutes  long 
and was recorded  by a member  of the research  team. All subjects  were 
exposed  to the same non-self  recording.  Brieﬂy,  the non-self  narrative  
served as a control for the self-condition  which, as previously  indicated,  
was expected  to exhibit high interindividual  variability.  To elicit this 
interindividual  variability,  a control condition  was included  that would 
exhibit low-variability  across participants.  
In response  to both narratives,  subjects  indicated  positivity  or nega- 
tivity on a moment-to-moment  basis by positioning  the cursor relative  to 
the center of the screen (see Fig. 1 b). For ease of distinction,  we assigned  
diﬀerent  colors corresponding  to diﬀerent  cursor positions.  The circular  
cursor appeared  green in proximity  to the center for a positive  appraisal,  
red towards  the periphery  for a negative  appraisal,  and yellow for inter- 
mediate  distances  reﬂecting  a neutral  evaluation.  These colors served 
to remind  participants  of their cursor position  reﬂecting  an emotional  
valence.  Additionally,  all participants  verbally  conﬁrmed  their under- 
standing  of the cursor task instructions  before beginning  the experiment.  
Cursor distance  from the center in pixels was sampled  at 200 Hz to cre- 
ate a behavioral  timeseries  concurrent  with the EEG recording.

2.6. Time-frequency  analysis  of EEG 
Our central research  question  on the sensorimotor  beta rhythm  was 
addressed  by ﬁrst estimating  the magnitude  of beta (15–30 Hz) power 
from the EEG channel  C3 in the left hemisphere  (contralateral  to the 
right hand used for response)  (see Fig. 3 A for channel  location).  C3 
has been widely used to study the sensorimotor  beta rhythm  from the 
primary  motor cortex ( Deiber et al., 2012 ; Gonzalez-Rosa  et al., 2015 ; 
Jackson  et al., 2019 ; López-Larraz  et al., 2015 ; Picazio  et al., 2014 ; 
Swann et al., 2015 ). The oscillatory  power of neural signal was cal- 
culated  by means of Fast Fourier  Transformation  (FFT) using the new- 
timef function  in EEGLAB.  This procedure  implements  the calculation  of 
changes  in oscillatory  power by means of a moving  window  (steps = 10 
msec). The mean event-related  (log) spectral  perturbation  (ERSP) was 
computed  with respect to the preceding  800 ms before the decision  cue. 
After the FFT, the epochs covered  from − 544 ms to 2439 ms around 
the decision  cue onset. 1 The ERSPs were averaged  across the beta fre- 
quency  range (15–30 Hz). Sensorimotor  beta rhythm  during the evalu- 
ation phase was identiﬁed  based on testing the presence  of the event- 
related desynchronization  (ERD) by comparing  the ERSP against  zero as 
described  in the Results section.  
2.7. ERP analysis  
In addition  to estimating  the sensorimotor  beta oscillations,  we es- 
timated  the ERPs in order to understand  the relative  timing of the sen- 
sorimotor  beta rhythm  within the temporal  cascade  of the decision  pro- 
cess. In particular,  we analyzed  the P2 and P3 components  involved  
in the processing  of reward-related  cues ( Glazer et al., 2018 ). The ERPs 
were identiﬁed  in the channels  of interest  (COI) reported  in our previous  
1 The epoch length prior to ﬀt was set to − 800 to 3200 ms around the deci- 
sion cue onset which included  the [ − 800 0] ms as a baseline,  [0 1500] ms as 
the duration  of decision  cue, and the ﬁrst 1700 ms of the subsequent  ﬁxation 
screen. This long epoch including  the post-cue  ﬁxation period was set expecting  
that after ﬀt, the interval will become shorter, cutting oﬀthe boundaries  of the 
decision  cue phase. After ﬀt, the epoch interval became − 544 ms to 2439 ms.

study using the same paradigm  as well as others that have identiﬁed  P2 
and P3 in similar decision-making  paradigms  ( Chen et al., 2019 , 2020 ; 
San Martin et al. 2013 , 2016 ). A frontocentral  COI consisted  of ﬁve 
electrodes  centered  on the standard  FCz channel  (Fz, FCz, Cz, FC1, FC2) 
and a parietocentral  COI consisted  of four electrodes  centered  on the 
standard  Pz channel  (Pz, POz, CP1, CP2) (Fig. S2). Average  amplitudes  
over these electrodes  were entered  in subsequent  statistical  analyses,  
with time windows  selected  according  to previous  studies ( Polich 2007 ; 
Potts et al., 1996 ) and by visual inspection  of the waveforms  in our data. 
All ERP results are reported  in the Supplementary  Materials.  
2.8. fMRI data analysis  
In our fMRI analysis  we primarily  focused  on determining  the co- 
variation  between  sensorimotor  beta and the BOLD responses  associ- 
ated the evaluation  phase, during which participants  were processing  
the reward and Go-probability  information.  Prior to testing for the co- 
variations,  we also investigated  the task-related  BOLD activations  in the 
evaluation  and action phase (standard  MRI analysis)  to replicate  prior 
studies of decision  making  within our newly developed  experimental  
paradigm  and conﬁrm  that it is well suited for the purpose  of our study. 
To this end, a GLM was constructed  including  the following  regressors.  
First, to look at brain activations  associated  with experimental  variables  
in the evaluation  phase and the action phase, we modeled  the onset of 
the decision  cues and Go/NoGo  stimulus  with a duration  of 0 s as the 
main regressors  of interest.  Only correct Go/NoGo  trials were included  
as main regressors  for action phase. Three parametric  regressors  were 
added to the decision  cue regressor  to account  for the main eﬀect of re- 
ward (large vs. small reward:  [1, − 1]), main eﬀect of Go-probability  
(75% vs. 50% vs. 25%: [1, 0, − 1]) and the interaction  between  the 
two factors (large_75%,  small_75%,  large_50%,  small_50%,  large_25%,  
small_25%:  [1, − 1, 0, 0, − 1, 1]). Next, to look at the covariation  between  
sensorimotor  beta and BOLD responses  associated  with the evaluation  
phase, we added the normalized  single-trial  beta power as a paramet-  
ric modulator  to the decision  cue regressor.  Additionally,  the following  
were included  as regressors  of no interest:  onset of feedback  with the 
magnitude  of reward points earned added as a parametric  regressor,  
onset of Go/NoGo  stimulus  with incorrect  responses,  and six head mo- 
tion parameters.  In order to account  for spurious  motion artifacts,  each 
frame displacement  greater than 0.5 mm was also coded as a covariate  
of no interest  in the GLM. 
Due to the complexity  of our GLM and the fact that our key regressors  
of interest  —i.e., decision  cue and Go/NoGo  stimulus  regressors  —were  
not always temporally  spaced out enough  despite jittering  of ISIs, we 
checked  for the multicollinearity  across the key regressors  2 by calculat-  
ing the variance  inﬂation  factor (VIF). The mean VIF across all subject 
was 1.41, which was close to 1 suggesting  ‘ no collinearity  ’ and much 
below 4 suggesting  ‘requiring  further investigation’  ( Akinwande  et al., 
2015 ; Craney and Surles 2002 ). 
Analyses  of fMRI data were conducted  in predetermined  regions-of-  
interest  (ROIs) based on our a priori hypotheses.  For anatomical  struc- 
tures that are relatively  large and well identiﬁed,  such as the cortical  
motor regions,  thalamus,  caudate  and putamen,  we used anatomical  
masks adapted  from standardized  templates  including  the Human  Mo- 
tor Area Template  (HMAT)  ( Mayka et al., 2006 ), WFU PickAtlas  toolbox  
( Maldjian  et al., 2003 ), and the Basal Ganglia  Human  Area Template  
(BGHAT)  ( Prodoehl  et al., 2008 ). In these anatomical  masks, the ef- 
fects of experimental  variables  and the covariation  with the sensorimo-  
tor beta oscillations  were assessed  using small volume  correction  with 
a peak voxel-level  p FWE-corr  < 0.05. For smaller  basal ganglia  struc- 
tures and functional  ROIs that we deﬁned  based on the literature,  we 
2 The key regressors  included  in testing for multicollinearity  were the deci- 
sion cue regressor,  its parametric  modulation  by sensorimotor  beta, and the 
correct/incorrect  Go/NoGo  stimulus  regressors.  created  spherical  ROIs centered  on the corresponding  MNI coordinates.  
The eﬀects of experimental  variables  and the covariation  with the senso- 
rimotor  beta oscillations  were summarized  by taking the average  of the 
eﬀect across all voxels within each spherical  ROI. The list of spherical  
ROIs, the MNI coordinates  and their relative  sizes in radius as wells as 
each of the references  from which the coordinates  were taken are listed 
in Table 1 . The sizes of the spherical  ROIs were adjusted  based on the 
respective  size of the structure.  Results from analyses  using the spherical  
ROIs are reported  after Bonferroni  correction.  
2.8.1. Task-related  BOLD activations  
We tested for the brain activations  associated  with encoding  of de- 
cision variables  (i.e., reward and Go-probability  information)  during 
evaluation  phase by testing for the three parametric  regressors  in pre- 
deﬁned  spherical  ROIs of the valuation  network  —the VS, vmPFC,  and 
VTA —adopted  from previous  studies ( Bartra et al., 2013 ; Murty et al., 
2014 ) (see Table 1 ). We also examined  task-related  activations  during 
the action phase, speciﬁcally  those associated  with Go vs. NoGo re- 
sponse.  Considering  that our Value-Based  Go-NoGo  task was not compa-  
rable to the traditional  Go-NoGo  paradigms  and that there was no spe- 
ciﬁc hypothesis  about the action phase, we performed  an exploratory  
whole-brain  analyses  in the contrast  between  Go vs. NoGo trials. These 
results are presented  in Supplementary  Materials.  
2.8.2. Covariation  between  the sensorimotor  beta oscillations  and the 
BOLD response  associated  with evaluation  phase 
The central aim of this study was to determine  the neural circuitries  
associated  with the sensorimotor  beta signal during the evaluation  
phase. Speciﬁcally,  we tested if the beta signal is associated  with the 
cortical  motor regions,  subcortical  basal ganglia  and thalamic  nuclei, 
or the valuation  network.  To this end, we ﬁrst tested for the eﬀect of 
the beta-power  modulation  within the anatomical  masks of the cortical  
motor regions  (HMAT),  thalamus  (extracted  from WFU PickAtlas  tool- 
box) and caudate/putamen  (BGHAT).  HMAT included  sub-regions  of the 
cortical  motor system including  the pre-supplementary  (pre-SMA)  and 
supplementary  motor (SMA) area, the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) 
premotor  cortex and, the primary  motor cortex (M1). For smaller  basal 
ganglia  nuclei (i.e., GPi, GPe, STN, SN), beta-power  modulation  was 
tested within the corresponding  spherical  ROIs ( Table 1 ). We then tested 
for the eﬀect of beta-power  modulation  in the valuation  network  (i.e., 
VS, vmPFC,  and VTA), using the same ROIs from the analysis  of task- 
related BOLD activations.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(25081, 25100), match=' Data availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(10361, 10367), match='  \n3. '>"

( Volz et al., 2015 ) and the responsiveness  to TBS depended  on the pre- 
interventional  network  connectivity  of the stimulated  region ( Cardenas-  
Morales  et al., 2014 ; Nettekoven  et al., 2015 ). 
Moreover,  the mechanism  underlying  rTMS/TBS  eﬀects on brain 
tissue are not clearly deﬁned.  Previous  studies demonstrated  that 
rTMS alters cortical  excitability  through  changes  in synaptic  strength  
( Chen et al., 1997 ; Cooke and Bliss, 2006 ; Fitzgerald  et al., 2006 ; 
Huang et al., 2005 ; Maeda et al., 2000b ; Pascual-Leone  et al., 1994 ). 
Animal  models provide  evidence  that TBS protocols  are more likely to 
induce long-term  potentiation  (LTP) and long-term  depression  (LTD) 
( Hess et al., 1996 ; Huemmeke  et al., 2002 ; Vickery  et al., 1997 ), which 
depend  on the GABAergic  and glutamatergic  systems  in the cortex 
( Funke and Benali, 2011 ; Lenz et al., 2016 ; Trippe et al., 2009 ). In the 
human,  the eﬀects of TBS on synaptic  transmission  have been measured  
indirectly,  by administrating  pharmacological  agents ( Huang et al., 
2007 ). Recently,  Stagg et al. (2009) used magnetic  resonance  spec- 
troscopy  (MRS) to measure  local changes  in the cortical  concentrations  
of GABA and glutamate  + glutamine  (Glx). They demonstrated  that cTBS 
increased  the GABA concentrations  at the target site. The study provides  
direct evidence  of GABAergic  interneuronal  activity  for the underlying  
mechanism  of cTBS and suggests  a possibility  that the GABAergic  system 
can also be an important  factor in rTMS responsiveness.  
Contrary  to studies on the motor system,  the inter-individual  vari- 
ability of rTMS responsiveness  has not been investigated  in higher 
cognitive  functions  such as language  and memory.  Some studies have 
excluded  non-responders  and only reported  the results of responders  
( Pattamadilok  et al., 2015 ; Sliwinska  et al., 2015 ) or reported  contrary  
results from the stimulation  protocols  (e.g., inhibitory  1Hz rTMS/cTBS  
inducing  a facilitatory  eﬀect) ( Andoh et al., 2006 ; Bonni et al., 2015 ). 
Given the dearth of information  about the nature of individual  diﬀer- 
ences in rTMS on higher cognition,  in this study, we explored  this use 
respect to semantic  memory,  a feature of human higher cognition  by 
employing  a combination  of MRS, fMRI and rTMS. 
Semantic  memory  is deﬁned  as the collective  knowledge  of the world 
including  words, pictures,  objects,  people,  and emotions.  Converging  
evidence  indicates  that the anterior  temporal  lobe (ATL) is the site of 
a transmodal  hub that generates  coherent  semantic  representations  by 
interacting  with multiple  modality-speciﬁc  brain regions  ( Binney et al., 
2010 ; Doeltgen  et al., 2010 ; Patterson  et al., 2007 ; Pobric et al., 2007 ; 
Sale et al., 2010 ; Todd et al., 2010a ; Todd et al., 2010b ; Visser et al., 
2012 ). Thus, perturbing  the ATL with inhibitory  rTMS/TBS  produces  
a temporal  semantic  impairment  leading  to slower reaction  times in 
healthy  participants  ( Jung and Lambon  Ralph, 2016 ; Lambon  Ralph 
et al., 2009 ; Pobric et al., 2010a , b ; Pobric et al., 2007 ). Although  ATL 
rTMS eﬀects on semantic  processing  have been repeatedly  demonstrated  
at the group level, there are often considerable  individual  diﬀerences  in 
the rTMS eﬀect. 
Here, we investigated  the inter-individual  variability  of rTMS re- 
sponsiveness  on semantic  processing  at the behavioural  level as well 
as at a neural/neurochemical  level using a combined  MRS and fMRI- 
guided cTBS. Previously,  we demonstrated  that the neurochemical  pro- 
ﬁles of the ATL were associated  with task-induced  regional  activity  and 
task performance  during semantic  processing  ( Jung et al., 2017 ). Specif- 
ically, GABA concentrations  in the ATL were positively  correlated  with 
semantic  task performance  and negatively  associated  with task-induced  
regional  activity  in the ATL during semantic  processing.  Here, we used 
the resting-state  MRS and fMRI data from our previous  study as the 
baseline  neurochemical  proﬁles  including  GABA, Glx concentrations,  
and Glx/GABA  ratio (excitation  and inhibitory  balance:  EIB). Then, we 
asked participants  to attend following  cTBS sessions.  cTBS was deliv- 
ered at the ATL through  individually  fMRI-guided  TMS neuronaviga-  
tion which maximizes  rTMS eﬀects at the behavioural  level ( Sack et al., 
2009 ). Participants  were assigned  into two groups (responders  and non- 
responders)  based on their semantic  performance  changes  after cTBS at 
the ATL. Based on previous  studies showing  the involvement  of GABAer-  
gic and glutamatergic  systems  in rTMS eﬀects (Funke and Benali, 2011; Lenz et al., 2016), we explored  the relationship  between  ATL cTBS re- 
sponsiveness  in semantic  processing  and baseline  neurochemical  pro- 
ﬁles including  GABA, Glx, and EIB in the ATL. Then, we compared  the 
baseline  neurochemical  proﬁles  of the ATL between  responders  and non- 
responders.  Our previous  investigation  demonstrated  that the synchro-  
nization  of the semantic  network  inclduing  the ATL, prefrontal,  and pos- 
terior temporal  cortices  were positively  associated  with the level of ATL 
GABA levels and semantic  task performance  ( Jung et al., 2017 ). Net- 
tkoven et al. (2015) demonstrated  that pre-interventional  nerual states 
predict the TBS responsiveness  in the motor system,  such that respon-  
ders showed  decreased  functional  connectivity  in the motor network  
compared  to non-responders.  Thus, we hyphothesized  that the neural 
state of the semantic  network  prior to the stimulation  could be asso- 
ciated with rTMS responsiveness  in semantic  processing.  Speciﬁcally,  
responders  would show decreased  connectivity  in the semantic  system 
including  the ATL compared  to non-responders.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Subjects  
Twenty  healthy  English  native speakers  (7 males, mean age = 23 
years ± 4, range from 20 to 36 years) participated  in this study. Right- 
handedness  was conﬁrmed  using the Edinburgh  Handedness  Inventory  
( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ). All subjects  provided  informed  written  consent.  The 
study was approved  by the local ethics committee.  
2.2. Experimental  design and procedure  
All subjects  had an fMRI and MRS at rest at the beginning  of the 
study, which have been previously  included  in a previous  publication  
( Jung et al., 2017 ). They performed  a semantic  association  task and a 
picture matching  task as a control task during fMRI. We used the pic- 
ture version  of semantic  association  task employed  by previous  studies 
( Pobric et al., 2010c ; Visser et al., 2012 ). The semantic  association  task 
required  subjects  to select which of two pictures  was more related in 
meaning  to a probe picture.  Three pictures  were presented  on the screen, 
a probe picture on the top, the target, and unrelated  picture at the bot- 
tom ( Fig. 1 A left). In the control task, subjects  had to select which of 
two patterns  was identical  to a probe pattern  ( Fig. 1 A right). The items 
for the pattern  matching  task were created  by scrambling  the pictures  
used in the semantic  association  task. An fMRI scanning  had 9 blocks 
of each task (interleaved  order, A-B-A-B).  Fixation  blocks for 4000ms  
were interleaved  with task blocks. A task block had 4 trials of each task 
and a trial started with 500ms ﬁxation  followed  by the stimuli for the 
duration  of 4500ms.  
After the MRI, all subjects  had two rTMS sessions  on diﬀerent  days. 
In each session,  subjects  received  rTMS stimulation  at the left ATL or 
control site (occipital  pole). The order of stimulation  was counterbal-  
anced across subjects.  A session consisted  of a baseline  block (No-TMS)  
and the after TMS block (post cTBS). The baseline  was performed  be- 
fore or 50mins  after the stimulation.  The order of blocks was counter-  
balanced  across subjects.  In each session,  subjects  performed  the same 
semantic  association  task and the control task. Tasks had 63 trials and 
a trial started with 500ms ﬁxation  then the stimuli were presented  until 
response  or 3000ms.  E-prime  software  (Psychology  Software  Tools Inc., 
Pittsburgh,  USA) was used to display  stimuli and to record responses.

predicting  the response  to an analgesic  procedure  ( Mackey  et al., 2019 ; 
Ploner and May, 2018 ; Reckziegel  et al., 2019 ; Van der Miesen et al., 
2019 ). 
Concerning  the assessment  of pain by EEG, diﬀerent  types of studies 
should be distinguished.  First, there are studies based on provoked  pain 
protocols,  comparing  EEG recordings  between  a control condition  and 
a condition  with pain caused by nociceptive  stimulation.  This type of 
study is often performed  in healthy  controls  (HC). However,  the EEG 
changes  associated  with acute provoked  pain, particularly  in HC, are 
not necessarily  relevant  as biomarkers  of chronic  pain ( Mouraux  and 
Iannetti,  2018 ; Reckziegel  et al., 2019 ). Therefore,  these studies will 
not be considered  in the literature  review performed  in this work. 
On the other hand, chronic  pain encompasses  a range of diﬀerent  
conditions  with speciﬁc  pathophysiological  mechanisms  and therapeu-  
tic management.  The three main mechanisms  at the origin of chronic  
pain are known to be nociceptive,  nociplastic,  and neuropathic.  Neuro- 
pathic pain is deﬁned  according  to the International  Association  for the 
Study of Pain as “pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory  
nervous  system ”( Scholz et al., 2019 ) and is considered  one of the most 
diﬃcult  painful conditions  to treat ( Baron et al., 2010 ). Speciﬁc  ther- 
apeutic  approaches  are recommended  for the treatment  of neuropathic  
pain ( Moisset  et al., 2020 ). In this context,  more objective  data would be 
useful to identify  proﬁles  of patients  more prone to respond  to speciﬁc  
treatments  in order to make therapeutic  decisions  less random.  
The objective  of our study is therefore  to deﬁne the resting-state  
EEG biomarkers  that could be speciﬁcally  associated  with chronic  neu- 
ropathic  pain. We studied  the changes  observed  in the diﬀerent  EEG 
frequency  bands and associated  with the presence  of this type of pain, 
also examining  the correlation  between  these changes  and the inten- 
sity of pain. Only two EEG reviews  have been published  in the area of 
chronic  pain. The ﬁrst, by Pascoal-Faria  et al. (2015) , was restricted  
to spinal cord injury. The other, by Pinheiro  et al. (2016) , addressed  
all types of chronic  pain indiscriminately.  The present  review includes  
updated  studies relating  speciﬁcally  to neuropathic  pain, discusses  the 
localization  of observed  regional  pain-related  EEG changes,  and outlines  
the perspectives  oﬀered by advanced  techniques  of EEG signal analysis.  
Such an analysis  of literature  data in this area is not currently  available  
to our knowledge.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Search strategy  and information  sources 
We followed  the Preferred  Reported  Items for Systematic  Reviews  
and Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  2021 guidelines  ( Page et al., 2021 ). A 
complete  search of the literature  published  in French or in English  un- 
til January  2022 was conducted  in PubMed  Medline  and Web of Sci- 
ence. The following  search terms were used: “((electroencephal  ∗ [tiab] 
OR EEG[tiab])  AND (chronic)  AND (pain) AND (neuropath  ∗ )) ”with the 
ﬁlters: restriction  to English  or French,  experimentation  on human.  The 
research  was equally  conducted  in the reference  list of included  articles  
and relevant  reviews  about EEG and pain. A protocol  was not prepared  
and this review was not registered.  
2.2. Eligibility  criteria 
An article was included  if resting-state  scalp EEG was assessed  in 
a group of patients  with pain (PwP) having chronic  ( > 3 months)  neu- 
ropathic  pain compared  to a control group of HC or disease-matched  
patients  without  pain (PwoP).  Non-controlled  studies were discarded.  
The primary  objective  of the studies was not taken into account,  i.e. 
studies were included  even if EEG investigation  was not the primary  
endpoint  but only a secondary  objective  measure.  In contrast,  articles  
dealing  with acute pain, provoked  pain or chronic  non-neuropathic  pain 
were excluded,  as well as studies based on invasive  EEG or MEG. Exper- 
imental  pain in non-human  models,  e.g., in primates  or rodents  were also excluded  from the review.  Finally,  only spontaneous  resting-state  
EEG data were analysed,  while dynamic  EEG responses  to various  tasks 
or cues were not taken into account.

row frequency  range exhibits  functional  speciﬁcity  for top-down  pro- 
cesses such as attentional  gain ( van Ede et al., 2010 , van ede et al., 
2011 , Nobre and van Ede, 2018 , Lee et al., 2013 ) and predictions  of 
causal events ( van Pelt et al., 2016 ). Beta power (i.e., the squared  magni- 
tude of beta oscillations)  is an index of integration  and global eﬃciency  
of the brain network  as a whole, and its ﬂuctuations  reﬂect variations  
in the level of integration  ( De Pasquale  et al., 2016 , de Pasquale  et al., 
2018 ). These slow dynamics  have been put forward  as suitable  candidate  
to represent  the time-varying  structure  of external  events ( Betti et al., 
2021 ). Crucially,  it seems to play an important  role in the interplay  be- 
tween sensory  and motor systems,  which ultimately  allows us to move in 
an environment  while adaptively  responding  to its stimuli ( Crapse and 
Sommer,  2008 ). 
Compelling  evidence  points to beta dynamics  as the potential  cor- 
nerstone  for intra- and inter-personal  levels of motor control.  When 
humans  perform  rhythmic  behaviors  such as ﬁnger-tapping,  beta ac- 
tivation  in sensorimotor  regions  is periodically  modulated  as a func- 
tion of movement  cycles ( Seeber et al., 2016 ). A similar cyclical  pat- 
tern of beta modulation  has been observed  in primary  auditory  areas in 
response  to rhythmic  auditory  stimuli,  under the condition  that these 
are presented  in a predictable  temporal  structure  ( Fujioka  et al., 2009 , 
Fujioka  et al., 2015 ). In the visual domain,  beta amplitude  in the pri- 
mary motor cortex reﬂects  the sensitivity  to predictable  visual stimuli 
relevant  to a motor task ( Saleh et al., 2010 ). Furthermore,  beta sup- 
pression  is consistently  observed  in the primary  sensorimotor  cortex in 
anticipation  of predictable  tactile stimuli,  and associated  with faster be- 
havioral  responses  to such stimulation  ( van Ede et al., 2011 ). The mech- 
anism is thought  to reﬂect temporal  orienting  of attention,  via a dynamic  
allocation  of neural resources  which facilitates  perception  ( Nobre and 
van Ede, 2018 ). More recently,  it was shown that beta power expresses  
cerebellar  “clocking  activity  ”( Andersen  and Dalal, 2021 ) which may 
serve to track environmental  inputs and prepare  the alignment  of mo- 
tor outputs  when the context  requires  it. Beta dynamics  based on power 
modulation  appear to be a common  denominator  when it comes to pre- 
dictions,  since evidence  converges  towards  a shared timing mechanism  
which the brain might use to pace behavior  to rhythmic  stimuli,  via 
action-perception  loops based on predictive  control.  
In social environments,  other humans  represent  exceptionally  salient 
social stimuli,  and a unique class of rhythmic  aﬀordances  for the mo- 
tor system ( Phillips-Silver  et al., 2010 ). Humans  have a strong tendency  
to synchronize  their movements  with each other, often spontaneously  
( Shockley  et al., 2003 , Richardson  et al., 2007 , Oullier et al., 2008 ) 
and even against  explicit  instruction  to ignore each other ( Rosso et al., 
2021 ). Interestingly,  the brain decodes  the kinematics  of visually  per- 
ceived movements  via modulation  of beta power ( Zhou et al., 2016 ), 
and evidence  from a dual-brain  stimulation  paradigm  suggests  that 20 
Hz bursts over the motor cortex causally  contribute  to establishing  and 
maintaining  synchronous  dyadic behavior  ( Novembre  et al., 2017 ). 
In this study, we hypothesized  that the human brain may rely on 
a shared mechanism  based on beta modulation,  both to track self- 
generated  behavior  and to predict the behavior  performed  by another  
individual.  In order to test this hypothesis,  we analyzed  dual-EEG  data 
recorded  during an interpersonal  synchronization  task. In the ‘drift- 
ing metronomes’  paradigm  for dyadic entrainment  ( Rosso et al., 2021 ), 
dyads of participants  were cued with two metronomes  set at diﬀerent  
frequencies,  and depending  on the condition  they could perceive  each 
other in visual or auditory  modalities.  In contrast  to most dual-EEG  ex- 
periments  which focus on measures  of interbrain  synchronization,  we 
here computed  a beta power timeseries  for each participant  as an in- 
trabrain  measure  ( Hamilton,  2021 ), and coupled  it to movement  cycles 
produced  by oneself (Self) and by the partner  (Other).  Whilst there is 
evidence  that some interbrain  coupling  measures  are genuinely  related 
to aspects  of social interaction,  their interpretation  is not always trans- 
parent, and their susceptibility  to spurious  correlations  calls for extra 
caution  ( Burgess,  2013 , Czeszumski  et al., 2020 ). Given a minimalistic  
joint ﬁnger-tapping  task and the control over the perceptual  coupling  between  partners,  we explicitly  modelled  the neural dynamic  of interest  
as a function  of overt behavior  occurring  in the interaction.  In presence  
of mutual coupling,  we expected  to observe  cyclical  beta power mod- 
ulation in each individual,  corresponding  to movements  performed  by 
Self and Other ( Fig. 1 ). 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-eight  (N = 28) participants  took part in the study (18 fe- 
males, 10 males; mean age = 29.07 years, std = 5.73 years). All of them 
were right-handed,  without  history of neurological  or psychiatric  disor- 
ders. None of them was a professional  musician,  although  some had mu- 
sical experience.  Handedness  was assessed  by means of the Edinburgh  
Handedness  Inventory  ( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ). Upon recruitment,  participants  
were randomly  paired with a partner  of the same gender.  The experi- 
ment was approved  by the Ethics Committee  of Ghent University  (Fac- 
ulty of Arts and Philosophy)  and informed  written  consent  was obtained  
from each participant.  Participants  received  a 15 €voucher  as economic  
compensation  for their time. 
2.2. Behavioral  task 
The two partners  forming  a dyad were sitting at the same table fac- 
ing each other. In order to avoid any tactile or proprioceptive  coupling,  
they were asked to lay their elbow on an armrest  at all times and avoid 
contact  with the table. Each partner  was assigned  to one circular  tap- 
ping pad and instructed  to tap on it with the right index ﬁnger, with 
the goal of synchronizing  with a metronome.  Depending  on the exper- 
imental  condition,  the metronome  could either be auditory  or visual, 
and the partner  was always perceived  in the complementary  modality.  
Each partner  was cued with a slightly  diﬀerent  metronome  tempo (100 
BPM and 98.5 BPM, or 1.67 Hz and 1.64 Hz, respectively  in terms of fre- 
quencies),  resulting  in a pattern  of continuous  de-phasing.  Hence, the 
metronomes’  relative  phase gradually  increased  from 0 to 𝜋radians,  and 
then decreased  from 𝜋to 0 radians  over the course of 10 consecutive  
cycles, for a total duration  of 390 s. Participants  were always instructed  
to ignore the partner  and tap along with the assigned  metronome.  For 
more details on the implementation  and the rationale  of the behavioral  
task, we refer to ( Rosso et al., 2021 ). Setup and experimental  design are 
illustrated  in Fig. 2 . 
Demographic  data were collected  before the experiment,  along with 
the administration  of the Edinburgh  Inventory  for handedness  assess- 
ment and the Interpersonal  Reactivity  Index (IRI) ( Davis, 1980 ). After 
every experimental  condition,  participants  provided  self-reports  on dif- 
ferent aspects  of the task by expressing  agreement  on a scale from 1 
( “Completely  disagree  ”) to 7 ( “Completely  agree ”) with a custom-made  
battery  of 11 Likert items. The complete  battery  is provided  as Supple- 
mentary  material  . From the whole battery,  we analyzed  two items which 
are relevant  to the present  study: “I found it diﬃcult  to keep the tempo 
of my metronome  ”, and “I felt in control over my own actions ”.

4. Results  
4.1. AQP1-encoding  rAAV vector causes DWI contrast  changes  in vitro 
and in vivo 
To examine  whether  the AQP1-encoding  rAAV vector can infect cells 
and function  as a DWI reporter,  we ﬁrst conducted  the in vitro study in 
the BHK21 cells. The cells were transfected  with each rAAV transfer  
plasmid  (P1, P2, or P3) ( Fig. 1 A) and collected  for MRI scanning.  The 
MRI results showed  that DWI signal intensities  in the cells expressing  ei- 
ther AQP1-EGFP  or AQP1 decreased  compared  to those expressing  EGFP 
alone or the mock control (Sham)  ( Fig. 1 B) . Consistently,  the ADC of 
AQP1-expressing  cells signiﬁcantly  increased  compared  to the control 
cells ( Fig. 1 C–D) , suggesting  that the rAAV vectors  encoding  the AQP1 
could be used as a DWI reporter.  
We next investigated  whether  the rAAV encoding  AQP1 could be 
visualized  by the in vivo DWI. The rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  or rAAV-EGFP  that 
allow local expression  of the exogenous  gene at the initial infection  site 
were stereotactically  injected  into the bilateral  CPU regions  in the mouse 
brain ( Fig. 2 A, n = 4). After 21 days’ infection,  the living mouse brain 
was imaged  using the MRI scanner.  The brain region injected  with the 
rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  represented  a strong DWI contrast  and higher ADC 
value than those at the contralateral  region ( Fig. 2 A, B ). The expression  
of AQP1-EGFP  and EGFP in the bilateral  CPU regions  was conﬁrmed  by 
immunohistochemistry  staining  and ﬂuorescent  imaging  of brain slices 
( Fig. 2 C ). The haematoxylin-eosin  staining  result revealed  that there 
was no edema or necrosis  in either the AQP1-EGFP  or EGFP expressing  
brain regions  ( Fig. S1 ), which is consistent  with ﬁndings  of a previous  
report ( Mukherjee  et al., 2016 ). 
To examine  the eﬀect of AQP1-encoding  rAAV on the neuronal  func- 
tions, the patch experiments  were conducted  in mice infected  with the 
rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  and rAAV-EGFP  in bilateral  CPU regions.  The results 
showed  no signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  in the fundamental  electrical  charac-  
teristics  between  the neurons  infected  with the rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  and 
rAAV-EGFP  ( Fig. S2 ). 4.2. Detection  of the neural connections  using in vivo DWI 
To detect the neural connection  of the whole brain in living ani- 
mals, the retrograde  AAV vectors  (rAAV2-retro)  were utilized  to trace 
the upstream  brain regions  of the injected  site. Five mice were included  
in each group. The rAAV2-retro  expressing  AQP1-EGFP  (rAAV-retro-  
AQP1-EGFP)  or EGFP alone (rAAV-retro-EGFP)  were constructed  and 
micro-injected  into the CPU region. 21 days after infection,  the living 
mouse brain was imaged  using the in vivo DWI method.  The patterns  of 
the GFP signals in both groups were similar,  suggesting  that the diﬀer- 
ent rAAV2-retro  vectors  retrograde  to the same brain regions  ( Fig. 3 ). 
No discernable  hypointensity  MRI contrast  was observed  in the brain 
infected  with rAAV-retro-EGFP  ( Fig. 4 A ). However,  the DWI images of 
the rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  group exhibited  a signiﬁcant  change in in- 
tensity ( Fig. 4 B ). Hypointensity  DWI contrast  could be found in multiple  
brain regions,  including  the injection  site of the right CPU, Ctx (cere- 
bral cortex),  BLA (basolateral  amygdala),  Ins (insular  cortex),  right Tha 
(thalamus),  right HIP (hippocampus).  The ADC map of all mice in the 
rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  and the rAAV-retro-EGFP  groups were calcu- 
lated and compared.  The ADC values of several regions  in the rAAV- 
retro-AQP1-EGFP  group were higher than the rAAV-retro-EGFP  group 
( Fig. 4 C ) and overlapped  with the regions  that showed  hypointensity  
DWI signals ( Fig. 4 B ). The presence  of AQP1 expression  in brain regions  
of the rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  group was observed  using immunohisto-  
chemistry  staining  ( Fig. 4 D ). To illustrate  the correlation  between  the 
results of MRI and immunohistochemistry  in the structural  brain regions  
or sub-regions,  the mouse brain atlas (Paxinos  and Franklin)  was su- 
perimposed  with the images ( Fig. S3 ). Although  the resolution  of the 
DWI-MRI  was much lower than the ﬂuorescence  imaging,  the AQP1 ex- 
pression  and AQP1-based  MRI contrasts  could be detected  in the same 
locations.  Extensive  overlap  areas of the DWI-MRI  contrast  and AQP1 
expression  signals ( Figs. 4 B–D and S3 ) were also found, suggesting  pro- 
nounced  activity  of the AQP1 as a DWI-MRI  reporter.  These tracing re- 
sults are consistent  with the reported  anatomical  connectivity  of the CPU 
( Davidsson  et al., 2019 ; Tervo et al., 2016 ). 
To further validate  the MRI-based  in vivo neural connections  tracing 
method,  the rAAV2-retro-AQP1-EGFP  was injected  into the VTA region 
that receives  abundant  input from the cerebral  cortex. As found in the 
CPU region ( Fig. 4 ), the neural connections  of VTA were also success-  
fully visualized  by both MRI and ﬂuorescence  imaging  approaches  ( Fig. 
S4 ). 
To this end, we have successfully  established  the rAAV2-retro-AQP1-  
EGFP that is able to eﬀectively  express  the AQP1 and trace the neural 
connections  visualized  by both the in vivo DWI and ﬂuorescent  imaging.

all performed  sensor-space  microstate  analysis  and then aimed to iden- 
tify the neural sources  of these sensor-space  microstates.  This includes  
source reconstruction  of the sensor-space  microstate  maps ( Milz et al., 
2016; Pascual-Marqui  et al., 2014; Tait et al., 2020 ), source reconstruc-  
tion of the raw data and calculating  power maps across samples  labelled  
as a particular  sensor space state ( Bréchet  et al., 2019; 2020; 2021; Milz 
et al., 2017 ), and spatiotemporal  regression  between  microstate  prob- 
ability time courses  and source-reconstructed  dynamics  at each dipole 
( Custo et al., 2017; 2014 ). However,  there are potential  limitations  to 
the approach  of source-reconstructing  sensor-space  microstates.  For ex- 
ample, since the projection  of cortical  sources  into sensor-space  has non- 
uniform  signal-to-noise  ratio across the cortex ( Goldenholz  et al., 2009 ) 
it is possible  that diﬀerent  spatial patterns  of brain activation  may give 
rise to similar EEG sensor-space  topographical  maps, potentially  lead- 
ing to low sensitivity  to diﬀerentiate  between  these spatial patterns.  For 
example,  alpha band occipital  sources  dominate  the sensor-space  eyes- 
closed resting-state  EEG ( Kropotov  and Kropotov,  2009 ) likely due to 
head shape and the forward  model resulting  in high signal-to-noise  ra- 
tio for these regions  ( Goldenholz  et al., 2009 ). It is possible  therefore  
that these same sources  predominantly  determine  the sensor-space  mi- 
crostate  topographies.  Milz et al. (2017) found evidence  for this, sug- 
gesting the sensor-space  EEG microstate  maps may be under-weighting  
the importance  of non-occipital  or non-alpha-band  networks.  Depth 
weighted  inverse  solutions  (e.g. eLORETA  ( Pascual-Marqui,  2007 ) or 
weighted  minimum  norm estimate  ( Fuchs et al., 1999 )) aim to adjust for 
the issues of non-homogeneous  signal-to-noise  ratio across the cortex. 
Hence, by ﬁrst source-reconstructing  and subsequently  performing  mi- 
crostate  analysis,  one may potentially  transform  the data in such a way 
as to increase  sensitivity  to contributions  of low cortex-to-sensor  signal- 
to-noise  ratio regions  to the map. This could potentially  increase  sensi- 
tivity to a wider number  of states and reduce the likelihood  that high 
signal-to-noise  ratio regions  dominate  the state topographies.  A more 
detailed  discussion  and justiﬁcation  for source-microstates  are given in 
Tait and Zhang (2022) . 
Recently,  we presented  a modiﬁcation  of the microstate  𝑘 -means al- 
gorithm  which generalizes  to source-space  microstate  analysis  ( Tait and 
Zhang, 2022 ). We applied  this algorithm  to uncover  source-space  
resting-state  microstates  and their associations  with auditory  stimula-  
tion ( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). A number  of further advancements  were 
also presented,  including  validation  that microstates  were associated  
with distinct  patterns  of cortical  synchrony  and a pipeline  to simu- 
late M/EEG  sensor- or source-space  data with known ground  truth mi- 
crostate  maps and microstate  sequences  ( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). 
Here, we present  +microstate,  an open-source  MATLAB  toolbox  
for multi-modal  analysis  of microstates  in M/EEG  sensor- and source-  
space using the generalized  𝑘 -means algorithm  presented  by Tait and 
Zhang (2022) . Several  open-source  toolboxes  for sensor-space  EEG mi- 
crostate  analysis  currently  exist such as Cartool,  a plugin for the Brain- 
Vision Analyzer,  and a plugin for EEGLAB  ( Michel and Koenig,  2018 ), 
but +microstate  is the only toolbox  available  for source-reconstructed  
microstate  analysis.  In addition  to the generalized  𝑘 -means algorithm  
for microstate  analysis,  +microstate  can perform  a number  of other 
functionalities.  While the focus is on 𝑘 -means,  +microstate  includes  op- 
tions to perform  Hidden  Markov  Modelling  (HMM;  Baker et al. (2014) ; 
Vidaurre  et al. (2018) ), principal  component  analysis  (PCA), and inde- 
pendent  component  analysis  (ICA; Hyvarinen  (1999) ) for brain-state  es- 
timation  using external  packages  (see Section  2.1.1 ) in the same frame- 
work as our microstate  pipeline  so that brain-state  dynamics  using dif- 
ferent methodologies  can be directly  compared  and contrasted.  Further-  
more, +microstate  includes  functions  for hypothesis  testing that mi- 
crostates  are associated  with distinct  patterns  of cortical  connectivity  
( Hatz et al., 2015; 2016; Tait and Zhang, 2022 ), as well as perform  
simulations  of data from ground  truth microstate  sequences  ( Tait and 
Zhang, 2022 ), which is useful for assessing  clustering  methodologies  
against  a ground  truth ( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). Novel advanced  statis- 
tical techniques  for task-based  analysis  are additionally  included  in the toolbox,  including  cluster-permutation  ( Maris and Oostenveld,  2007 ) 
extensions  to topographic  ANOVAs  (TANOVAs)  ( Murray  et al., 2008 ) 
and 𝜒2 statistics  of microstate  probabilities  in response  to stimuli 
( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). +microstate  is based around objects which 
store the data and have intuitively  named functions  for analysis,  simu- 
lation, visualization,  and statistics,  resulting  in a simple,  accessible  tool- 
box for microstate  analysis  with limited coding background  required.  
This manuscript  is structured  as follows.  In Section  2 , we out- 
line the requirements,  implementation  and usage of +microstate,  in- 
cluding  key commands  and how data is stored. In Section  3 , we 
present  examples  which demonstrate  validity  of the toolbox  with em- 
pirical/simulated  sensor/source-space  M/EEG  data, with a focus on 
benchmarking  against  ground  truths. This includes  analysis  of resting-  
state EEG to reproduce  the well established  canonical  EEG microstates  
( Michel and Koenig,  2018 ), analysis  of MEG event related ﬁelds (ERFs) 
to uncover  a sensor-MEG  microstate  associated  with diﬀerent  levels of 
activation  under diﬀerent  experimental  conditions,  analysis  of source-  
space MEG microstate  sequences  in response  to auditory  stimuli,  and 
reproducing  ground  truth source-space  microstate  maps and microstate  
statistics  in a simulated  experiment.  Codes and data for these analyses  
are freely available  and included  in +microstate  as MATLAB  Live Script 
tutorials,  and the ﬁgures reported  here were produced  using MATLAB’s  
default random  number  generator  seed to increase  transparency  and 
reproducibility.  Therefore  the examples  presented  here may act as val- 
idation of the toolbox,  examples  of possible  use cases of the toolboxes,  
and as a tutorial.  
2. Materials  and Methods  
2.1. Installing  the toolbox 
+microstate  can be freely downloaded  from https://github.com/  
lukewtait/microstate  _ toolbox  . To use the toolbox,  MATLAB  should be 
installed  and the folder +microstate  should placed into a folder on the 
MATLAB  path. 
2.1.1. Requirements  
+microstate  is compatible  with MATLAB  R2017b  and later ver- 
sions; rigorous  testing with earlier versions  of MATLAB  have not been 
performed.  A number  of MATLAB  built in toolboxes  are required  for 
full functionality,  including  the Statistics  and Machine  Learning  tool- 
box, Signal processing  toolbox,  and Wavelet  toolbox  (only required  
for simulations  of random  walk sequences).  A number  of external  
toolboxes  are also used and the required  functions  are included  with 
+microstate  under microstate.external  . These include  Fas- 
tICA v2.5 ( https://research.ics.aalto.ﬁ/ica/fastica/  ) to use ICA for clus- 
tering, HMM-MAR  ( https://github.com/OHBA-  analysis/HMM-  MAR ) to 
use Hidden  Markov  Modelling  for clustering,  and freely available  
custom-written  scripts for data visualization  of summary  statistics  
( https://github.com/lukewtait/matlab  _ data _ visualization  ). 
2.2. The ‘individual’  object 
All data from a given participant  or scan is stored in an object of the 
individual  class. Methods  for this class include  the functionality  to import 
and preprocess  the data, perform  individual-level  microstate  analysis,  
calculate  statistics  of microstate  sequences,  and calculate  microstate-  
segmented  functional  connectivity.  An empty individual  object can be 
created  by calling ms = microstate.individual  in the com- 
mand line, where ms is a microstate  individual  object. The electrophys-  
iological  data is stored in the class properties:  
•data : A 𝑇 ×𝑁double array storing the MEG/EEG/source  recon- 
structed  time series, where 𝑇 is the number  of samples  and 𝑁is the 
number  of sensors/ROIs.  
•time : A vector of length 𝑇 containing  the time axis for the data.

the ERP/ERF  module is only used for evoked 
data, and is skipped when individuals  in the 
cohort correspond  to single-trial  data from dif- 
ferent participants.  A full list of functions  for 
the individual  and cohort objects are given in 
Supplementary  Materials  1-2. 
•modality  : A character  array, which can be either 'meg', 'eeg', 
'source' , or 'ampenv' depending  on the modality  of the data. 
•bad_samples  : A vector containing  the indices of bad samples,  
such as samples  which contain  artifacts.  
Once microstate  analysis  has been performed,  other relevant  prop- 
erties of the class will be ﬁlled, such as: 
•gfp : A vector of length 𝑇 containing  the GFP of each sample.  
•maps : A 𝑁 ×𝑘 double array storing the microstate  maps resulting  
from cluster analysis,  where 𝑘 is the number  of clusters.  
•label  : A vector of length 𝑇 containing  the integer microstate  label 
of each sample resulting  from cluster analysis.  
•stats  : A structure  which can output statistics  of the microstate  
sequences.  
•networks  : A cell array of length 𝑘 containing  𝑁 ×𝑁functional  
networks.  
An overview  of the individual  object is given in Figure 1 . A full list 
of properties  and methods  for the individual  object can be found by typ- 
ing doc microstate.individual  in the MATLAB  command  line, and are also given in Supplementary  Material  1. Below, we outline the 
various  modules  (i.e. groups of methods)  for the individual  object in the 
typical order of useage.  
2.2.1. Adding and preprocessing  data 
To construct  a non-empty  microstate  individual  object, the following  
command  is used: 
ms = microstate.individual(data,modality,time)  
; where the inputs data , time , and modality  ﬁt the descriptions  of 
the class properties  with the same name given above (note, alternatively  
time can be given as a single value corresponding  to a sampling  rate, 
and the time axis will be automatically  generated).  Bad samples,  for 
example  those identiﬁed  by artifact  detection  algorithms,  can be added 
by typing ms = ms.add_bad_samples(bad_samples)  . 
Alternatively,  an empty individual  object can be created  as ms = 
microstate.individual  , and data can be subsequently  be added. 
If data is in the correct format for +microstate,  it can be added us- 
ing the add_data  function.  Additionally,  +microstate  integrates  with 
a number  of other M/EEG  processing  toolboxes,  allowing  for data to 
3  L. Tait and J. Zhang NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119346 
be imported  directly  from these toolboxes.  The toolboxes  integrated  
with +microstate  (and their respective  +microstate  functions  to im- 
port data) are: 
•Fieldtrip  ( Oostenveld  et al. (2011) ; http://ﬁeldtriptoolbox.org  ). 
Import data using the function  ms = ms.import_fieldtrip  
(data)  , where data is a Fieldtrip  raw, timelock,  or or source 
structure.  
•SPM ( https://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/  ). For MEEG objects,  use 
the function  ms = ms.import_spm_meeg(D)  , where D is 
the SPM MEEG object. For source data, one must ﬁrst cal- 
culate the inverse  ﬁlter in SPM (automatically  saving the ﬁl- 
ter in the MEEG object),  and then call the function  as ms =

While the focus of +microstate  is on microstate  analysis  as op- 
posed to data preprocessing,  some simple preprocessing  commands  
are included.  Functions  for preprocessing  include  re-referencing  EEG 
data to average,  resampling,  bandpass  ﬁltering,  orthogonalization  
( Colclough  et al., 2015 ), and calculating  the amplitude  envelope.  A typ- 
ical microstate  pipeline  might include  bandpass  ﬁltering  1-30 Hz, re- 
referencing  to average  (EEG only), and resampling  to 256 Hz (if data is 
sampled  at faster rates) ( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). This default pipeline  is 
simple to call and implemented  as a default,  by calling 
ms = ms.preprocess  ; 
Other functions  are called in a similar manner,  e.g. to bandpass  
ﬁlter in the range a - b Hz, one could call ms = ms.preprocess  
_filter(a,b)  . Almost all functions  have optional  inputs which can 
be called in name-value  pairs, e.g. for a band-stop  ﬁlter between  48-52 
Hz to attenuate  line noise, type 
ms = ms.preprocess_filter(48,52,'type','stop')

2.2.2. Performing  microstate  analysis  using k-means  clustering  - theory 
𝑘 -means clustering  has been a primary  method  for EEG microstate  
analysis  since it was ﬁrst proposed  by Pascual-Marqui  et al. (1995) . 
+microstate  implements  a generalization  of this 𝑘 -means clustering  
algorithm  which may additionally  be used with source-reconstructed  
data. The toolbox  views instantaneous  maps as vectors  in 𝑁-dimensional  
space (where 𝑁is number  of electrodes/sensors/dipoles).  A modality-  
speciﬁc  transform  is applied  to these vectors.  For EEG, the transform  is a re-reference  to average.  For MEG, no transform  is required.  For source-  
space data, we must deal with the problem  of dipole ﬂipping.  One can 
either take the amplitude  envelope,  or the absolute  value of the source 
data. In both cases, polarity  is ignored  (e.g. the maps [-1,1] and [1,1] are 
treated as identical),  which is a limitation  of source-space  microstates.  
The former is more suited to a narrowband  signal and ignores  phase 
information,  while the latter is applicable  to narrow  or broadband  and 
largely maintains  phase diﬀerences  (excluding  a diﬀerence  of 𝜋). For 
this reason,  we use the absolute  value for source-data  throughout  this 
manuscript,  but both methods  are available  in +microstate.  Then the 
map similarity  is deﬁned  as the cosine of the angle between  these vec- 
tors, 
𝑅 ( 𝐱 , 𝐲 ) = |cos 𝜃𝐱𝐲 |= |𝐱 𝑇 ⋅𝐲|√
𝐱 𝑇 ⋅𝐱 √
𝐲 𝑇 ⋅𝐲 , (1) 
where 𝐱, 𝐲 ∈ℝ 𝑁×1 are the two (transformed)  maps. Note that for ERPs, 
the absolute  value should not be taken in Equation  1 , since changes  in 
polarity  are of interest  when studying  ERPs, e.g. to ensure the visual 
P1 and N1 peaks are not clustered  together  as a single state. Since the 
source-space  transform  involves  taking the absolute  value or amplitude  
envelope,  a limitation  of source-space  ERP microstate  analysis  is that 
polarity  will be ignored,  and hence positive  and negative  peaks may be 
clustered  as a single state. Similarly,  GFP for a map is the length of the 
vector (i.e. a normalized  vector norm), 
𝜎= √ √ √ √ 1 
𝑁 − 1 𝑁 ∑
𝑛 =1 𝐱 2 
𝑛 , (2) 
where 𝐱 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) is the value of the 𝑛 ’th element  of vector 𝐱. These deﬁnitions  
of map similarity/GFP  were chosen because,  in the case of the average-  
reference  transform,  they exactly equal correlation  and standard  devi- 
ation respectively.  Hence, for EEG the generalized  pipeline  is equal to 
the EEG microstate  pipeline.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119528,"Data availability  and quality 
There are three dimensions  regarding  training  data that need to be 
considered:  size, diversity  , and accuracy  . Although  a few techniques  can 
be applied  to reduce the required  amount  of data for training,  a decent 
sample size is necessary  to tune the network  parameters  for a speciﬁc  
task, and to avoid overﬁtting  issues. However,  including  inaccurately  
labelled  data will compromise  the model performance.  Due to the low 
prevalence  of some CSVD lesions in the general  population,  including  
MRI data acquired  from patients  in clinical  settings  can help increase  the 
size of data for training  and validation.  However,  clinical  MRI data are 
usually  limited by the short acquisition  time and therefore  low spatial 
resolution.  CMB, PVS and lacunes  are small lesions,  usually  with diame- 
ters less than 5 mm. Clinical  MRI scans with thick slices (3–5 mm) may 
miss some lesions due to the signiﬁcant  partial volume  eﬀects. In the 
case of PVS, since the number  of PVS is usually  large in the brain, studies 
usually  examine  representative  regions  (e.g., centrum  semiovale,  basal 
ganglia).  A slightly  thicker slice may be acceptable  in such cases if at 
least one slice is acquired  on the desired  region. The location  of the ac- 
quired image slice should be as consistent  as possible  across individuals  
through  locating  landmarks  (e.g., anterior  and posterior  commissure).  
Having  said that, overly thick slices will aﬀect the richness  of contex-  
tual information  from nearby brain regions  which is sometimes  used in 
identifying  PVS. A general  recommendation  of slice thickness  ≤ 3 mm 
would be safe for extracting  CMB, PVS and lacunes  from clinical  scans. 
In addition,  a large number  of similar cases contribute  less than a good 
variety of data. The diversity  of data can come from diﬀerent  sample 
types (healthy  vs. various  diseases)  and scanners/scanning  parameters.  
Studies  using more than one scanner/cohort  for development,  validation  
and testing have been summarized  in Supplementary  Text 1.

On most occasions,  these three factors (size, accuracy,  diversity)  can- 
not be all satisﬁed.  Labelling  small lesions,  like CMB, PVS and lacunes,  
at the voxel level is time-consuming  and subjective.  Usually,  multiple  
raters are assigned  with the same set of data for labelling.  Results are 
then compared,  and for inconsistent  labels, a consensus  is reached  by the 
majority  vote, or being checked  by a more experienced  clinician.  As a 
result, individual  studies are unlikely  to obtain suﬃcient  high-accuracy  
voxel-level  labels for training.  Collaborations  are a promising  approach  
in this regard, as pooling  small data samples  with labels increases  both 
the size and diversity  of data. Public resources  identiﬁed  during the sys- 
temic review have been summarised  in Table 5 . Available  studies have 
applied  data augmentation  with basic translations,  rotations  and mir- 
roring to generate  more data ( Rashid et al., 2021 ). Introducing  artefacts  
such as bias ﬁeld and noise to the images may be helpful for the model 
to generalise  to diﬀerent  samples/scanners  ( Billot et al., 2020 ). In addi- 
tion, techniques  such as uncertainty  modelling  ( Karimi et al., 2020 ) and 
domain  adaption  ( Guan and Liu, 2022 ) can be incorporated  to address  
the issues due to inaccurate  or subjective  labels and excessive  data het- 
erogeneity  due to the data acquisition  process.  Such methods  have been 
developed  for biomedical  image analysis  in general,  but not particularly  
for the domain  of CSVD lesions.  
The MRI modalities  to input into models are also worth considering  
carefully.  Although  there have been consensus  MRI modalities  for each 
CSVD lesion, a small number  of studies included  additional  modalities  
(e.g., QSM ( Rashid et al., 2021 ) and PD ( Ghafaryasl  et al., 2012 )), that 
are not commonly  available,  to improve  the performance.  This may not 
be optimal  when considering  the generalisability  of the model. Some 
techniques,  such as knowledge  distillation  ( Guan et al., 2021 ), could be 
considered  to resolve this issue.

with NH participants  can provide  better control over several variables  
(e.g., the number  of surviving  neurons  in the cochlea,  deafness  onset 
time, and even the channel  number  of CI). Thus, in this study, we fo- 
cused only on the NH group. 
Studying  how NH participants  learn to comprehend  vocoded  sounds 
has revealed  several crucial cognitive  factors,  including  working  mem- 
ory capacity  ( Rosemann  et al., 2017 ) and auditory  skills ( Erb et al., 
2012 ). In addition,  neural correlates  of vocoded  sound learning  have 
also been reported  Eisner et al. (2010) showed  that activation  in the in- 
ferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during intelligible  vocoded  sound learning  was 
correlated  with improvements  in vocoded  sound recognition.  However,  
these correlational  results are insuﬃcient  for predictions.  The main goal 
of the present  work was therefore  to use fMRI and machine  learning  
algorithms  to ﬁnd neuronal  signatures  to forecast  untrained  NH partic- 
ipants’ future vocoded  speech comprehension  levels. 
We investigated  whether  brain activations  of auditory  processing  be- 
fore NH participants  received  vocoded  training  could be used to predict 
their later comprehension  levels. Our participants  underwent  a ﬁve-day  
experiment.  On the ﬁrst day (t1), their brain activations  for vocoded  
sounds processing  were measured.  After the MRI scan, they received  
a ﬁve-day-long  vocoded  sounds training  session.  Their vocoded  speech 
comprehension  levels were measured  at the end of the ﬁfth day of train- 
ing (t2). The brain data acquired  on the ﬁrst day (t1) were then (i) 
utilized  to conduct  the correlation  analysis  to evaluate  the relationship  
between  the neural correlates  of auditory  processing  and their ﬁfth-day  
(t2) speech comprehension  levels, and (ii) treated as a decoding  feature 
to train a linear classiﬁer  to predict untrained  participants’  future (t2) 
performances  (i.e., whether  they will be good or bad learners).

5. Results  
5.1. Diaschisis  eﬀects 
We analyzed  fMRI language  activation  (i.e. Sp > Rev) with respect 
to normative  functional  connectivity  to the individual  lesion site, be- 
cause diaschisis  eﬀects per deﬁnition  must depend  on connectivity  to 
the lesion. 
Language  activation  in regions  with high and low connectivity  to the 
individual  stroke lesion was extracted  at all three points in time (acute, 
subacute  and chronic)  separately  (see Fig. 4 A and Supplementary  Ta- 
ble 3). To highlight  deviations  from normal  activation  patterns,  mean 
language  activation  from healthy  controls  was subtracted  from patient’s  
activation.  This means, that the dashed baselines  at zero in Fig. 4 corre- 
spond to normal  levels of language  activation  as seen in healthy  controls  
while values below that line correspond  to underactivation  in patients  
compared  to controls.  Looking  at Fig. 4 A, we saw activation  mostly be- 
low the level of controls  in both conditions  at all points in time. Ad- 
ditionally,  activation  was signiﬁcantly  lower in regions  with high than 
low normative  connectivity  to the lesion at the acute time point (paired  
t -test, T = 2.3, p = 0.01) corresponding  to a possible  diaschisis  eﬀect.

Eﬀect sizes of healthy controls have been subtracted  to speciﬁcally  examine stroke induced eﬀects. The dashed line at zero therefore  represents  normal activity levels as observed

residualized  for the subject factor to account for the within-subject  design. Central marks of the box represent  the median value, the edges are the 25th and 75th percentiles,  
and the whiskers  extend to the most extreme data points not more than 150% of the interquartile  range beyond the boxes. Filled circles represent  individual  data points. 
In line with our hypothesis,  underactivation  seemed  to be most pro- 
nounced  at the acute time point in regions  with high normative  con- 
nectivity  and to return to normal  over time, compatible  with the phe- 
nomenon  of resolution  of diaschisis.  To statistically  test our hypothesis,  
we performed  a 2 ×3 repeated  measures  ANOVA  with the factors lesion 
connectivity  (high, low) and time (acute, subacute,  chronic)  based on 44 
complete  longitudinal  data sets. Both factors and the interaction  ‘time x 
lesion connectivity’  satisﬁed  the assumption  of sphericity  according  to 
the Mauchly-test  ( p > 0.05). Post-hoc  Bonferroni-corrected  t-tests were 
performed  when a factor or interaction  explained  a signiﬁcant  fraction  
of variance.  The results are displayed  in Fig. 4 B and Table 1 . We found that the factor ‘time’ explained  a signiﬁcant  amount  of 
variance  ( Fig. 4 B, middle panel). Bonferroni  corrected  post-hoc  t-tests 
showed  a signiﬁcant  increase  in language  activation  from the acute to 
the subacute  and from the acute to the chronic  measurement.  This in- 
crease might be partially  caused by reperfusion  of the ischemic  penum-  
bra. Our main research  question,  however,  was whether  increase  in ac- 
tivation  depends  on connectivity  to the lesion. Although  there was no 
eﬀect of lesion connectivity  per se ( Fig. 4 B left panel), the interaction  
‘time x lesion connectivity’  explained  a signiﬁcant  amount  of variance  
( Fig. 4 B right panel). This demonstrates  that temporal  dynamics  in lan- 
guage speciﬁc  activation  indeed depend  on lesion connectivity.  Bon-

Panel A displays  the predeﬁned  mask (red) of candidate  regions aﬀected  by potential  diaschisis  eﬀects on the group level deﬁned by signiﬁcantly  less activation  
of patients  at any point in time compared  to healthy controls  (conjunction  null of two-sample  t-tests, p(FWE) < 0.05 at the cluster-level,  cluster forming  threshold  
p < 0.005). Panel B and C show the spatial distribution  (overlap)  of regions with high and low lesion connectivity  in all 71 patients.  Panel D shows diﬀerences  in 
this distribution  between  regions with high and low lesion connectivity  (random  permutation  test with 5000 permutations,  p(FWE) < 0.05 on the voxel-level).  The 
contrast  high > low is shown in warm and the opposite  contrast  in cool colors. Numbers  refer to absolute  diﬀerence  in occurrence  of the labels high and low lesion 
connectivity.  The upper row shows lateral surface renderings  of the left hemisphere;  the lower row shows renderings  of the inferior brain surface. Abbreviations:  L:

ferroni corrected  post-hoc  t-tests demonstrated  a signiﬁcantly  steeper  
increase  in language  speciﬁc  fMRI activation  in regions  with high than 
in regions  with low lesion connectivity  from the acute to the subacute  
phase. This could be explained  by a distinct  diaschisis  eﬀect in regions  
with high lesion connectivity  in the acute phase, which (at least par- 
tially) resolves  from the acute to the subacute  phase. Of note, the sub- 
traction  of language  activation  of healthy  controls  (measured  once) from 
language  activation  of patients  (measured  longitudinally)  does not in- 
ﬂuence  the results of all statistical  tests performed  longitudinally.  
We were also interested  in the spatial  distribution  of the regions  
with high and low lesion connectivity  in all 71 patients  ( Fig. 5 B and 5 C) 
within the predeﬁned  mask ( Fig. 5 A) and indeed found speciﬁc  diﬀer- 
ences ( Fig. 5 D). Regions  with high lesion connectivity  (where we would 
expect diaschisis  eﬀects)  were located  signiﬁcantly  more frequently  in 
left frontotemporal  cortical  areas, especially  in the inferior  frontal gyrus 
(pars triangularis  and opercularis),  and the middle temporal  gyrus, es- 
pecially  in the posterior  portion.  Regions  with low lesion connectivity  
were more frequently  found in the left inferior  temporal  and fusiform  
gyri. 
5.2. Correlation  with behavioral  data 
To test for behavioral  relevance  of the described  eﬀects on fMRI ac- 
tivation,  we performed  correlation  analyses  between  diﬀerential  fMRI 
eﬀect sizes and global severity  of aphasia.  Since we were particularly  
interested  in the interaction  ‘time x lesion connectivity’,  we performed  
linear (i.e. Pearson)  correlation  analyses  between  the eﬀect of ‘lesion 
connectivity’  (diﬀerence  of mean fMRI activation  in regions  with high 
and low –i.e. high minus low –connectivity  to the lesion) with the lan- 
guage recovery  score (LRS) for each point in time separately  (see ﬁrst 
three columns  of Table 2 ). 
We found a signiﬁcant  correlation  between  LRS and lesion 
connectivity-dependent  language  activation  at the subacute  measure-  
ment ( n = 67, p = 0.003, signiﬁcant  after Bonferroni  correction,  see 
Fig. 6 A). Better language  performance  (in terms of LRS values)  was as- 
sociated  with higher language  activation  in regions  with high compared  
to low lesion connectivity.  We argue that low values in this contrast  re- ﬂect a diaschisis  eﬀect because  they denote less language  activation  in 
regions  with high lesion connectivity  compared  to regions  with low le- 
sion connectivity.  Therefore,  the described  positive  correlation  indicates  
that less diaschisis  (or more resolution  of diaschisis)  at the subacute  
measurement  is related to better language  performance.  
As our conclusions  are mainly based on longitudinal  changes  in fMRI 
activation,  we additionally  performed  correlation  analyses  between  lon- 
gitudinal  changes  of fMRI eﬀect sizes and LRS (see last three columns  of 
Table 2 ). Here, we found a signiﬁcant  association  between  resolution  of 
the language  speciﬁc  diaschisis  eﬀect (i.e. Δhigh > low) and behavioral  
improvement  ( ΔLRS) from the subacute  to the chronic  measurement  
( n = 50, p = 0.003, signiﬁcant  after Bonferroni  correction,  see Fig. 6 B). 
6. Discussion  
This is the ﬁrst study examining  functional  diaschisis  eﬀects and 
their functional  relevance  in patients  with acute aphasia  due to ischemic  
stroke by combining  lesion network  mapping  with longitudinal  task- 
based fMRI. Our hypothesis  was that resolution  of lesion-distant  neural 
dysfunction  (diaschisis),  operationalized  by increasing  language  speciﬁc  
fMRI activation,  would be located  predominantly  in regions  with high 
normative  connectivity  to the lesion site as assessed  with resting-state  
fMRI data from healthy  participants.  In accordance  with our hypothesis,  
we found a signiﬁcantly  steeper  increase  of language  speciﬁc  activation  
from the acute to the subacute  measurement  in regions  with high than 
in regions  with low lesion connectivity.  We interpret  this increase  in 
activation  as resolution  of the diaschisis  eﬀect in functional  networks  
aﬀected  by the lesion. The behavioral  relevance  of this eﬀect is shown 
by a signiﬁcant  correlation  between  global language  scores and the size 
of the diaschisis  eﬀect at the subacute  measurement.  Speciﬁcally,  higher 
language  speciﬁc  activation  in regions  with high compared  to low lesion 
connectivity  was associated  with better global language  performance.  
The link between  diaschisis  and the language  deﬁcit in the early phase 
post stroke is particularly  plausible  given the spatial distribution  of re- 
gions with high compared  to those with low lesion connectivity  ( Fig. 5 D) 
which closely resembled  core language  regions  in the inferior  frontal 
gyrus and the middle temporal  gyrus mostly pronounced  in its posterior

Pearson correlation  analyses  between  lesion connectivity  speciﬁc language  activation  (i.e. high 
> low) and language  recovery  score were calculated  for each measurement  (acute, subacute,  
chronic)  and for longitudinal  changes  between  the measurements  (acute-subacute,  subacute-  
chronic,  acute-chronic)  using all available  data. Positive r-values  indicate  that higher language  
activation  in regions with high compared  to low lesion connectivity  (i.e. less diaschisis)  corre- 
lates with better language  performance  or that resolution  of diaschisis  correlates  with behavioral  
improvement,  respectively.  Reported  p-values  are uncorrected.  Asterisks  indicate  signiﬁcant  
correlations  after Bonferroni  correction.  Abbreviations:  r = correlation  coeﬃcient,  p = proba-

(A) In the subacute  measurement,  there was a signiﬁcant  correlation  between a language  speciﬁc diaschisis  eﬀect ( i.e. high > low lesion connectivity)  and language  recovery  
score. The positive association  means that less diaschisis  correlates  with better language  performance.  (B) Improvements  in these two measures  from the subacute  to the chronic 
phase were also signiﬁcantly  correlated.  Solid lines represent  best linear ﬁt with its 95% conﬁdence  interval (dashed lines). Circles are individual  data points. Abbreviations:

portion  ( Binder et al., 2009 ; Noonan  et al., 2013 ; Rodd et al., 2015 ). 
Our data suggest  that language  deﬁcits  in the early phase after stroke 
are partially  caused by functional  diaschisis  eﬀects in frontotemporal  
core areas for language  processing.  This means that regions  previously  
functionally  connected  to the lesion site become  dysfunctional  because  
of the missing  input from the lesion site. In turn, this leads to less lan- 
guage speciﬁc  activation  in these regions.  
Importantly,  while previous  studies on diaschisis  in aphasic  patients  
focused  solely on subcortical  lesions ( Boes et al., 2015 ; Hillis et al., 2002 ; 
Vallar et al., 1988 ; Weiller  et al., 1993 ), we here provide  evidence  for 
diaschisis  in functional  networks  mostly aﬀected  by cortical  infarcts.  
Furthermore,  improvement  of aphasia  might be partially  caused by res- 
olution  of functional  diaschisis.  Indeed,  the corresponding  correlation  
analysis  of longitudinal  behavioral  changes  and longitudinal  changes  
in diﬀerential  fMRI activation  demonstrated  a signiﬁcant  association  of 
behavioral  recovery  and resolution  of the functional  diaschisis  eﬀect, 
which, however,  was found from the subacute  to the chronic  phase. 
Nevertheless,  our behavioral  data ( Fig. 3 ) conﬁrmed  the previously  de- 
scribed  pattern  of highly dynamic  language  recovery  in the early phase 
which then decelerates  over time ( Pedersen  et al., 1995 ). We therefore  
interpret  our data in the sense that the early behavioral  improvement  
seen in many aphasic  patients  might be caused by resolution  of diaschi-  
sis to a signiﬁcant  degree.  This is in line with previous  studies that show that resolution  of diaschisis  occurs mainly within the ﬁrst days to weeks 
after stroke onset ( Carrera  and Tononi,  2014 ; Witte et al., 2000 ). 
In the study of diaschisis,  the added value of combining  task-based  
fMRI and lesion network  mapping  is of particular  importance.  In pre- 
vious studies,  task-based  fMRI in acute aphasic  stroke patients  showed  
an acute decrease  in language  speciﬁc  activation  in both hemispheres  
which then resolved  over time as a possible  correlate  of diaschisis  
( Saur et al., 2006 ; Stockert  et al., 2020 ). Using this method  in isola- 
tion, however,  it remained  unclear  whether  the longitudinal  dynamics  
in activation  (or which part of it) depends  on connectivity  to the lesion 
as one would expect in diaschisis.  On the other hand, studies solely us- 
ing lesion network  mapping  demonstrated  a relationship  between  nor- 
mative lesion connectivity  to Broca’s  area and aphasia  in patients  with 
subcortical  lesions ( Boes et al., 2015 ). Yet, in this study it remained  un- 
clear whether  a dysfunction  in Broca’s  area indeed caused the aphasia.  
Alternatively,  involvement  of the lesioned  subcortical  areas (all func- 
tionally  connected  to Broca’s  area) in language  processing  could have 
led to aphasia.  The combination  of both methods,  as implemented  in 
our study, allows demonstrating  an acute decrease  in activation  which 
then partially  resolves  over time. This resolution  is signiﬁcantly  more 
pronounced  in regions  with functional  connections  to the lesion. In our 
opinion,  this operationalization  of the diaschisis  eﬀect and its resolution  
is the closest one described  in the literature  so far.

Alternative  mechanisms  contributing  to early post-stroke  fMRI acti- 
vation changes  include  hypo- and reperfusion  of the ischemic  penumbra  
( Hillis et al., 2008 ; Hossmann,  1994 ). The current  analysis  used existing  
data from research  projects  that primarily  aimed at characterizing  lan- 
guage recovery  after aphasic  stroke with no speciﬁc  focus on diaschisis.  
Therefore,  no perfusion  measurements  were performed.  We argue, that 
eﬀects of reperfusion  are represented  by the main eﬀect of ‘time’ with 
an increase  of language  activity  mainly from the acute to the subacute  
time point while the interaction  ‘time x lesion connectivity’  speciﬁcally  
demonstrates  an additional  lesion connectivity  dependent  increase  in 
language  activity  representing  resolution  of diaschisis.  This is based on 
the assumption  that the dependency  of dynamics  in fMRI activation  on 
normative  lesion connectivity  (represented  by the interaction  ‘time x le- 
sion connectivity’)  cannot be explained  by vascular  eﬀects because  func- 
tional networks  are independent  of vascular  territories  ( Beckmann  et al., 
2005 ). It should be noted though,  that regions  with high lesion connec-  
tivity tended to belong to the territory  of the middle cerebral  artery 
while regions  with low lesion connectivity  more frequently  belonged  to 
the vertebrobasilar  territory  (see Fig. 5 D). To address  this limitation,  
we repeated  the original  analysis  with a small modiﬁcation.  We used 
distance  maps instead  of lesion network  maps to deﬁne regions  near to 
the lesion (i.e. in the ischemic  penumbra)  and remote from the lesion 
(i.e. outside  the ischemic  penumbra).  Each distance  map encodes  the 
(shortest)  distance  to the individual  stroke lesion (see Supplementary  
Information  for methodological  details).  We would expect reperfusion  
eﬀects mainly in regions  near to the lesion and not or to a lesser extent 
in regions  remote from the lesion. The overall results were comparable  
to the original  analysis  (cf. Table 1 ). However,  the interaction  ‘time x 
proximity’  did not reach signiﬁcance.  Therefore,  subacute  reactivation  
was the same in regions  near to the lesion (i.e. ischemic  penumbra)  and 
remote from the lesion. Additionally,  none of the correlation  analyses  
(analogous  to Table 2 ) was signiﬁcant.  In sum, this additional  analy- 
sis could not support  the hypothesis,  that reperfusion  of the ischemic  
penumbra  was driving  subacute  reactivation.  Similarly,  less fMRI acti- 
vation in acute stroke patients  could also be caused by a failure of the 
BOLD signal due to an acute disruption  of the neurovascular  coupling  
( Krainik  et al., 2005 ). However,  by contrasting  language  activation  in 
regions  with high and low lesion connectivity,  we again minimize  the 
potential  impact of such eﬀects because  it can be assumed  that BOLD- 
failure would aﬀect the whole vascular  territory  and not only regions  
functionally  connected  to the lesion. In addition,  longitudinal  BOLD sig- 
nal changes  in stroke patients  have been shown to reﬂect changes  in 
neural activity  rather than resolution  of disrupted  neurovascular  cou- 
pling ( Geranmayeh  et al., 2015 ). The same applies to in-scanner  per- 
formance.  One might argue that acute fMRI underactivation  could be 
caused by less engagement  in the task as in-scanner  performance  is de- 
creased  mostly at the acute measurement  (see Supplementary  Table 2). 
While the main eﬀect of ‘time’ could be interpreted  in such a way, our 
main ﬁnding  of a ‘time x connectivity’  interaction  is not impressible  by 
this argument  because  a performance  associated  decrease  of activation  
would not dependent  on lesion connectivity.  
Finally,  we would like to address  some limitations  of our study. First, 
our interpretation  that resolution  of diaschisis  leads to behavioral  im- 
provement  is fundamentally  linked to the correlation  analysis  of lon- 
gitudinal  changes  in fMRI activation  and behavioral  scores. In contrast  
to our hypothesis,  there was no such longitudinal  correlation  of behav- 
ioral improvement  and the resolution  of diaschisis  from the acute to 
the subacute  phase. On the one hand, the absence  of this correlation  in 
our data might be caused by confounding  reperfusion  eﬀects. As men- 
tioned before, hypoperfusion  and reperfusion  have an impact on acute 
behavioral  performance  and therefore  partially  mask eﬀects driven by 
diaschisis  and its resolution.  Indeed,  we found a signiﬁcant  correlation  
of mean fMRI activation  (regardless  of lesion connectivity)  and behav- 
ioral performance  in the acute phase ( r = 0.28, p = 0.04, n = 54) in an 
exploratory  analysis.  Although  we have argued in favor of the validity  
of diﬀerential  fMRI eﬀect sizes also in the acute phase, these arguments  do not apply to the behavioral  data. This might explain  the fact that 
our data supports  acute resolution  of diaschisis  in terms of connectiv-  
ity speciﬁc  fMRI reactivation  but without  correlating  with behavioral  
improvement.  On the other hand, we found a signiﬁcant  correlation  in 
the time period between  the subacute  and chronic  measurement.  Di- 
aschisis  is expected  to resolve mainly within the ﬁrst days to weeks af- 
ter stroke ( Carrera  and Tononi,  2014 ). Nevertheless,  the time period 
from the subacute  ( Ø= day 11) to the chronic  ( Ø= day 150) mea- 
surement  partially  overlaps  with the early post-stroke  phase ( ∼ﬁrst few 
weeks).  Therefore,  we speculate  that the described  longitudinal  correla-  
tion from the subacute  to the chronic  measurement  might nevertheless  
reﬂect behavioral  improvement  caused by resolution  of diaschisis  in the 
ﬁrst few weeks. Alternatively,  diaschisis  eﬀects might partially  persist 
substantially  longer than a few weeks after stroke onset ( DeMarco  and 
Turkeltaub,  2020 ; Price et al., 2001 ) and therefore  might render it a 
potential  target for adjuvant  non-invasive  brain stimulation  in neurore-  
habilitation.  Second,  the present  study exclusively  considers  damage  
to gray matter.  Future eﬀorts might additionally  incorporate  structural  
connectome  data to identify  ﬁber tracts and corresponding  cortical  re- 
gions aﬀected  by disconnection  mechanisms  due to white matter dam- 
age ( Foulon et al., 2018 ; Fox, 2018 ; Yourganov  et al., 2016 ). Third, 
in lesion network  mapping,  lesions are used as regions  of interest  for 
resting-state  functional  connectivity  analyses.  However,  these regions  
of interest  follow vascular  territories  and might thus be very heteroge-  
neous in terms of functional  anatomy.  They range from small lesions 
in a single functional  network  to large lesions spanning  multiple  func- 
tional networks.  This might lead to some bias in the corresponding  le- 
sion network  maps which might be less accurate  and less meaningful  
with increasing  lesion sizes ( Boes, 2021 ). Finally,  we exclusively  stud- 
ied post-stroke  aphasia.  Yet, our methodological  approach  might also 
be of value for other stroke induced  (higher  order) deﬁcits  or even data 
sets featuring  multiple  behavioral  domains.  
7. Conclusion  
We combined  lesion network  mapping  and task-based  fMRI to exam- 
ine resolution  of functional  diaschisis  eﬀects in patients  with post-stroke  
aphasia  due to cortical  infarctions.  We found that resolution  of neural 
dysfunction,  as expressed  by an increase  of fMRI activation  over time 
distant to the lesion, depends  on normative  functional  connectivity  to 
the lesion site. Because  this eﬀect was behaviorally  relevant,  we argue 
that resolution  of diaschisis  might be a relevant  mechanism  contribut-  
ing to the early fast behavioral  improvement  often seen in patients  with 
aphasia.  Additionally,  the presented  data demonstrate  that lesion net- 
work mapping  is a suitable  approach  to study diaschisis  eﬀects based 
solely on the lesion location  inferred  from clinical  imaging.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(30190, 30218), match=' Data and code availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(24802, 24813), match='  \nFunding '>"

ceives nociceptive  input from, among others, the slow conduction  poly- 
modal C-ﬁbers  ( Benarroch,  2012 ; Lumb et al., 2002 ; Satpute  et al., 2013 ; 
Tovote et al., 2016 ) that modulate  parasympathetic  responses,  and is in- 
volved in freezing  behavior  in response  to threats ( Faull et al., 2016 ). As 
such, it is implicated  in passive  emotional  coping strategies  such as qui- 
escence,  vasodepression,  and freeze and appease  responses  ( Keay et al., 
1997 ; Carrive  et al., 1997 ). The respective  roles of these two regions  in 
processing  threat and pain are deduced  from animal studies and has not 
been thoroughly  studied  in the human brain. 
Here, we study activation  and functional  connectivity  in three task- 
related and one resting state MR scan from a dataset designed  for in- 
vestigations  of cued pain response  in healthy  subjects.  During the task, 
visual cues suggested  the incoming  stimulus  intensity,  referred  to here 
as cued threat. Participants  observed  the cued threat (prediction),  expe- 
rienced  heat pain stimuli (sensory  evidence),  and then rated the evoked  
pain intensity.  The eﬀects of the cues were evaluated  by comparing  pain 
ratings after presenting  cues that signaled  high or low cued threat, or 
when the strength  of incoming  stimulus  was unknown.  We used a data- 
driven technique  ( Hashmi  et al., 2013 ) for measuring  PAG responses  
to the three selected  conditions.  Next, we tested the brain-wide  circuits  
that dl/l and vlPAG participated  in. Towards  this goal, we ﬁrst looked at 
the synchronizations  between  dl/l and vlPAG with other brain regions  
during the epochs in which high, low, and unknown  pain threats were 
presented  visually  before the heat stimuli at the same intensity.  Sec- 
ond, we compared  whole brain dl/l and vlPAG functional  connectivity  
for the entire resting state and task scans. Third, we used time varying  
functional  connectivity  (TVFC)  to instantiate  whether  the dl/lPAG  and 
vlPAG behave synchronously  with other brain regions  from moment  to 
moment  when observed  under the same experimental  conditions.  Using 
the TVFC method,  we identiﬁed  diﬀerences  in regions  connecting  pref- 
erentially  with dl/lPAG  and vlPAG on a moment  to moment  basis. We 
also assessed  if these regions  diﬀer in the total number  of nodes that they 
connect  with. To gain complementary  insights  from static and dynamic  
functional  connectivity  analysis,  we assessed  the brain wide connectiv-  
ity of dl/lPAG  and vlPAG during rest and task scans with static and with 
time-varying  FC. This triangulation  using multiple  approaches  consis- 
tently demonstrated  signiﬁcant  and whole brain corrected  diﬀerences  
in the dl/lPAG  and vlPAG connectivity  patterns.  The within-subject  de- 
sign, combined  with the use of a large number  of volumes  from diﬀerent  
types of scans (rest and task), diverse  analytical  approaches  (activation,  
static and time-varying  functional  connectivity),  and observations  from 
a control brainstem  ROI, were used to establish  the validity  of the ﬁnd- 
ings. 
2. Methods  
Study data. This study is a component  of a larger study directed  
at developing  biopsychosocial  and neurological  markers  associated  
with treatment  failure in chronic  back pain (clinicalTrials.gov:  RCT 
#NCT02991625).  The main goal of the larger study is to establish  the 
scope and limitations  of neuroimaging  for identifying  reproducible  and 
reliable  ﬁndings  from brain data that can pinpoint  chronic  pain mech- 
anisms.  In this study, we investigate  the speciﬁcity  and reproducibility  
of properties  of the PAG columnar  pathways  in healthy  controls.  The 
task design and whole-brain,  voxel-wise  activations  in task-related  data 
have previously  been published  ( Lim et al., 2020 ). This study delineates  
the activations,  task-related  synchronizations,  and functional  connec-  
tivity characteristics  of the PAG columns  in a model-free,  data-driven  
manner.  
Participants.  The study protocol  was approved  by the Nova Sco- 
tia Health Research  Ethics Board. Data was collected  in healthy  partici-  
pants (21 female;  mean age ± SD of 31.23 ± 10.91 years; range of 20–56 
years). From the 42 subjects  who participated  in the study, resting-state  
data was successfully  collected  from 39 participants  and complete  pain 
task scans were available  in 38 subjects.  Participants  were excluded  if 
they (1) had ongoing  acute or chronic  pain, were (2) taking pain med- ication,  (3) pregnant,  or (4) unﬁt for MRI scanning  (i.e., cardiac  and 
respiratory  conditions  that would lead to interference  with the study, 
metal implants,  dental braces, claustrophobia),  or (5) had neurologi-  
cal or psychiatric  disorders.  Before pain task scans, all participants  ﬁrst 
underwent  structural  and resting-state  fMRI scans. Subsequently,  they 
underwent  task scans while performing  the pain expectation  task de- 
scribed  below. 
Study protocol.  The ﬁrst set of psychophysical  measurements  col- 
lected were heat evoked  pain threshold  and heat evoked  pain tolerance.  
Next, participants  were trained  in seeing visual cues across a screen, 
experiencing  a heat stimulus,  and rating the intensity  of their pain on 
a scale in response  to said heat stimuli,  which were held at 45 °C and 
47 °C in a random  order. 
Epoch design.  For a summary  depiction,  see Fig. 1 A. The visual cues 
presented  during the task would either predict the stimulus  intensity  
(example:  “the incoming  heat stimulus  is at 9% intensity  ”) or prompt  
that the stimulus  intensity  is unknown  ( “the incoming  heat stimulus  
intensity  is unknown  ”). The visual cues lasted 4.75 s, and were followed  
by a delay screen of 1.9 s (black screen with white ﬁxation  cross). Heat 
stimuli started from a baseline  temperature  (35 °C), increased  to plateau  
at a peak intensity,  then decreased  back down to baseline,  at a rate of 
4 °C/second.  Each stimulus  lasted 8 s. Plateau  durations  were dependent  
on the peak intensity;  thus, a peak intensity  of 45 °C and 47 °C would 
last for 3 and 2 s, respectively.  After another  delay screen of 4.75 s, 
participants  rated their perceived  pain experience  within 6 s with the 
numerical  rating scale (NRS). The interval  between  epochs was jittered  
at delays of 1.9s-8.55  s. 
Task conditions.  Pain task scans consisted  of three types of epochs:  
matched,  mismatched  at level 1, and mismatched  at level 2. See Fig. 1 B- 
D for a schematic.  
The ﬁrst run consisted  of epochs containing  only the matched  condi- 
tion, where the cue-values  correctly  predicted  the heat stimulus  inten- 
sity. In the matched  condition  run, participants  experienced  peak stim- 
ulus temperatures  (4",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5334, 5337), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(7134, 7136), match='3.'>"

relevant  targets for biopsy.  Alternatively,  we can study speciﬁc  mi- 
crostructural  features  in healthy  and pathological  cortical  tissue using 
post-mortem  histological  analysis.  This approach,  however,  poses mul- 
tiple logistical  challenges,  such as the scarcity  of human brain speci- 
mens, the potential  of confounding  factors due to comorbidities,  and 
the variability  of tissue ﬁxation,  e.g., the time interval  from death 
to ﬁxation.  In addition,  post-mortem  whole-brain  histological  anal- 
ysis is also hampered  by important  technical  challenges  in process-  
ing the entire cortex, such as non-uniform  tissue deformations  within 
individual  brain sections  and the co-registration  of large tissue sec- 
tions to construct  a 3D representation  of the cortex ( Amunts  et al., 2013; 
Wagstyl  et al., 2020 ). 
There is a pressing  need to develop  large-scale  non-invasive  neuro- 
radiological  methods  that are sensitive  to region-speciﬁc  cortical  archi- 
tectonic  features  and to pathological  alterations  in vivo. A whole-brain,  
non-invasive  assessment  of cortical  cyto- and myelo-architectonic  fea- 
tures could improve  our ability to monitor  brain development,  diagnose  
neurodegenerative  diseases  and brain injury, guide biopsies  for neu- 
ropathological  analysis,  and aid in neurosurgical  planning.  More gener- 
ally, large-scale  cortical  architectonic  mapping  could complement  our 
current  eﬀorts to study the structure  and organization  of the brain and 
its role in many neuropathies.  
Several  studies have explored  the sensitivity  to cortical  areal and 
laminar  architectonic  features  of conventional  MRI contrasts  such as 
T1-weighted  ( Barazany  and Assaf, 2012 ), T2 ∗ -weighted  ( Kemper  et al., 
2018 ), MRI phase contrast  ( Duyn et al., 2007 ), T2-weighted  and magne-  
tization  transfer  ( Trampel  et al., 2019 ). Combinations  of these contrasts  
are primarily  sensitive  to the concentration  of myelin across diﬀerent  
cortical  layers enabling  diﬀerentiation  of speciﬁc  regions  such as the pri- 
mary somatosensry  and motor areas ( Glasser  et al., 2016; Glasser  and 
van Essen, 2011 ) but cannot reveal architectonic  boundaries  between  
other cortical  areas. Diﬀusion  MRI (dMRI)  is a promising  method  for 
quantifying  cyto- and myeloarchitectonic  features  in gray matter (for re- 
view see ( Assaf, 2019 )) due to its unique sensitivity  to tissue microstruc-  
tural and architectural  characteristics,  such as the sizes, shapes,  and 
densities  of cells ( Pierpaoli  and Basser, 1996 ), the content  of myelin,  
and the orientation  of tissue microstructural  components  ( Budde and 
Annese,  2013 ). 
Ultra-high  resolution  dMRI studies with ﬁxed tissue suggest  that wa- 
ter diﬀusion  in the cortex shows preferentially  radial and tangential  pro- 
cesses ( Aggarwal  et al., 2015; Kleinnijenhuis  et al., 2013; Leuze et al., 
2014 ) aligned  with features  of the local microstructure  ( Budde and An- 
nese, 2013; Leergaard  et al., 2010; Seehaus  et al., 2015; 2013 ), such as 
the orientation  of neuronal  processes,  microtubules,  neuroﬁlaments,  or 
the shapes and density  patterns  of neural cells. Moreover,  these diﬀusion  
properties  vary with cortical  depth allowing  us to resolve the laminar  
patterns  of the cortical  cyto- and myeloarchitectonic  organization,  for 
review,  see ( Assaf, 2019 ). Large-scale  (e.g., whole-brain)  high-resolution  
dMRI studies using ﬁxed ( Dyrby et al., 2011; McNab et al., 2009; 2013b; 
Miller et al., 2011 ) and live human brains ( Ganepola  et al., 2018; Gulban  
et al., 2018; Heidemann  et al., 2010; Jaermann  et al., 2008; Kang et al., 
2012; Kleinnijenhuis  et al., 2015; McNab et al., 2013b; Truong  et al., 
2014b; Wang et al., 2021 ) suggest  that the radial and tangential  diﬀu- 
sion processes  vary with the cortical  folding geometry  ( McNab et al., 
2013b ), potentially  allowing  us to detect transition  regions  along the 
cortical  ribbon between  the laminar  patterns  of adjacent  cortical  areas 
( Aggarwal  et al., 2015; Bastiani  et al., 2016; Ganepola  et al., 2018; Klein- 
nijenhuis  et al., 2013; Leuze et al., 2014; Nagy et al., 2013 ). Surface-  
based analysis  removes  the cortical  folding dependence  by analyzing  
signals across topologically  consistent  “laminar  ”s u r f a c e  meshes  sam- 
pling the cortex from the pial surface to the border between  gray mat- 
ter (GM) and white matter (WM) ( Ganepola  et al., 2018; McNab et al., 
2013b; Nagy et al., 2013 ). The cortical-depth  dependence  of dMRI has 
focused  primarily  on speciﬁc  properties,  such as diﬀusion  anisotropy  
( Kleinnijenhuis  et al., 2013; Nagy et al., 2013; Truong  et al., 2014b ). 
These preliminary  results suggest  that features  of dMRI signals have the potential  to distinguish  boundaries  between  cortical  layers and areas 
with distinct  architectonic  features.  
Mean apparent  propagator  (MAP) MRI ( Özarslan  et al., 2013 ), is an 
eﬃcient,  comprehensive,  and clinically  feasible  ( Avram et al., 2018a; 
2014b; 2016 ) advanced  dMRI method  that quantiﬁes  general  diﬀusion  
processes  in healthy  and diseased  tissues.  In each voxel, MAP-MRI  ex- 
plicitly measures  the probability  density  function  of the net 3D displace-  
ments of water molecules  diﬀusing  in tissues,  also known as the diﬀusion  
propagator.  Thus MAP-MRI  subsumes  and generalizes  other dMRI meth- 
ods ( Avram et al., 2017 ) such as diﬀusion  tensor imaging  (DTI) ( Basser 
et al., 1994a; 1994b ) or diﬀusion  kurtosis  imaging  (DKI) ( Jensen et al., 
2005 ), and yields a family of new microstructural  parameters  that quan- 
tify important  features  of the propagators  and reﬂect local microstruc-  
tural and architectural  features,  such as the zero-displacement  probabil-  
ities, non-gaussinity,  or anisotropy  ( Avram et al., 2018a; 2014b; 2017; 
2016 ). However,  to date, no study has explored  the cortical-depth  de- 
pendence  of diﬀusion  propagators,  such as those measured  with MAP- 
MRI across larger regions  of the cortex. Correlating  areal and laminar  
variations  of MAP propagators  with histologically  stained  tissue sec- 
tions is an important  step toward establishing  the sensitivity  and bi- 
ological  speciﬁcity  of MAP-MRI  and its potential  for integrating  neu- 
roradiological  and neuropathological  observations.  Nevertheless,  such 
correlation  studies are diﬃcult  to conduct  in large sections  of human 
brains because  of technical  challenges  with histological  analysis  of hu- 
man brain specimens  (immersion  ﬁxation,  deformation,  co-registration  
of 2D sections)  and scanning  using whole-brain  dMRI at spatial reso- 
lutions high enough  to resolve the cortical  layers (imaging  distortions,  
gradient  heating,  long scan duration)  ( Dyrby et al., 2011; McNab et al., 
2009; Roebroeck  et al., 2019; Shatil et al., 2016 ). 
In this study, we apply high-resolution  MAP-MRI  to quantify  ar- 
chitectonic  features  throughout  the entire cortex of a perfusion-ﬁxed  
macaque  brain and correlate  the areal and laminar  variations  of MAP- 
derived  microstructural  parameters  with observations  from the corre- 
sponding  and matched  histologically  stained  images derived  from the 
same brain. The ability to map cortical  architecture  noninvasively  could 
advance  our understanding  of the structure  and function  of healthy  and 
pathological  brains and improve  our ability to monitor  brain develop-  
ment and diagnose  neurodegenerative  diseases  and brain injury.

tributed  networks  to ﬁne-grained,  spatially  local ones ( Allen et al., 2011 ; 
Damoiseaux  et al., 2006 ; Iraji et al., 2019 ). Interestingly,  spatial patterns  
obtained  by applying  independent  component  analysis  (ICA) to spatial 
maps of thousands  of diﬀerent  activation  conditions  derived  from the 
BrainMap  meta-analytic  tool (https://www.brainmap.org)  closely re- 
semble large-scale  networks  ( Smith et al., 2009 ), as do data-driven  anal- 
yses of activation  maps from task data ( Calhoun  and Allen, 2013 ), fur- 
ther supporting  the functional  relevance  of functional  networks.  These 
approaches  are implicitly  built upon the notion of continuous  informa-  
tion processing  and interaction  among brain regions.  
In parallel  to this work, another  family of approaches,  that we collec- 
tively called event detection  approaches,  was developed  originally  based 
upon a hypothesis  that functional  patterns  and brain networks  emerge  
from discrete,  neural events ( Chialvo,  2010 ; Tagliazucchi,  Balenzuela,  
Fraiman,  and Chialvo,  2012 ). Therefore,  instead  of studying  static or 
dynamic  functional  patterns  in the context  of ongoing,  continuous  func- 
tional interactions,  this family of approaches  focuses  on extracting  dis- 
crete events to study static and dynamic  functional  patterns.  The com- 
mon procedure  for these approaches  is to ﬁrst select a set of extreme  time 
points (e.g., top 10%) as event present  time points (EPTs) and use only 
these EPTs to obtain corresponding  brain functional  patterns  ( Liu and 
Duyn, 2013 ; Tagliazucchi  et al., 2012 ). There are also work that uniﬁed 
these two steps to directly  obtain events and associated  time points, 
for example,  by applying  clustering  on all time points ( Liu, Chang, and 
Duyn, 2013 ). These approaches  assume  that these event present  time 
points alone are suﬃcient  to estimate  the temporal  dependency  and to 
derive the functional  connectivity  patterns  observed  in functional  con- 
nectivity  studies ( Cifre, Zarepour,  Horovitz,  Cannas,  and Chialvo,  2020 ; 
Tagliazucchi,  Balenzuela,  Fraiman,  Montoya,  and Chialvo,  2011 , 2016 ), 
and resting-state  functional  connectivity  is driven by short-lived  coﬂuc- 
tuation  events ( Zamani  Esfahlani  et al., 2020 ). As such, event-based  
studies shift away from typical functional  connectivity  and mainly fo- 
cus on capturing  functional  patterns  as (co-)activation  patterns  of sparse 
EPTs using ﬁrst-order  statistics  and signal amplitude  rather than sta- 
tistical dependence  between  them ( Petridou,  Gaudes,  Dryden,  Francis,  
and Gowland,  2013 ; Tagliazucchi  et al., 2012 , 2011 ). Event detection  
approaches  have shown direct correspondence  between  such spatial co- 
activation  patterns  and large-scale  brain networks  obtained  from func- 
tional connectivity  analysis  ( Liu et al., 2013 ; Tagliazucchi  et al., 2012 ). 
They also demonstrated  that diﬀerent  EPTs of a given node represent  dif- 
ferent co-activation  patterns  reﬂecting  dynamic  information  of rsfMRI 
data ( Karahano  ğlu and Van De Ville, 2015 ; Liu and Duyn, 2013 ). How- 
ever, these ﬁndings  were limited to large-scale  distributed  brain net- 
works with no established  observations  of ﬁne-grained  networks  (ICNs) 
obtained  from high-order  ICA. This, in turn, may indicate  that event de- 
tection approaches  are limited to dominant  large covarying  functional  
patterns.  
After years of using ﬁrst-order  statistics  in event-based  studies,  
which followed  early work utilizing  the temporal  dependency  be- 
tween extreme  time points to derive the functional  connectivity  
( Tagliazucchi  et al., 2012 , 2011 ), recent studies revisited  the idea of 
using extreme  time points to study (dynamic)  functional  connectivity  
in the context  of second and higher-order  statistics  and demonstrated  
the potential  to provide  additional  insights  into cognition  and behavior  
( Sporns et al., 2021 ; Tagliazucchi  et al., 2016 ; Zamani  Esfahlani  et al., 
2020 ). 
These intriguing  ﬁndings,  along with the potential  clinical  and be- 
havioral  relevance  of EPTs ( Bolton et al., 2020 ; Chen, Chang, Greicius,  
and Glover,  2015 ; Gaviria  et al., 2021 ) and a number  of supporting  ob- 
servations  in animal studies ( Liang, Liu, and Zhang, 2015 ; Matsui,  Mu- 
rakami,  and Ohki, 2019 , 2016 ), further buttress  the assumption  that 
rsfMRI signal may originate  from brief, sporadically  events rather than 
continuous  dynamic  functional  interactions.  This has led to a growing  
interest  in studying  brain function  using momentarily  sparse time points 
and related approaches  ( Bolton et al., 2020 ; Janes, Peechatka,  Freder-  
ick, and Kaiser, 2020 ; Miller, Pearlson,  and Calhoun,  2019 ; Takeda,  Ita- hashi, Sato, and Yamashita,  2019 ; Zhang, Pan, and Keilholz,  2020 ; 
Zimmern,  2020 ). 
However,  an important  question  that has not yet been addressed  is 
whether  estimating  results from only EPTs omits important  informa-  
tion, potentially  leading  to misleading  conclusions.  While we do not 
refute the existence  of discrete,  neural events or even the possibility  of 
large-scale  networks  are emerged  from these spontaneous,  infrequent  
events, we argue against  the proposition  that functional  patterns  esti- 
mated from the spontaneous  blood oxygenation  level-dependent  (BOLD)  
signal manifest  only in temporally  sparse burst moments  and these dis- 
crete EPTs contain  incomplete  information  about the underlying  func- 
tional patterns.  This position  can be supported  by two speciﬁc  obser- 
vations.  First, it has been shown that spiking  activity  propagates  using 
both asynchronous  and synchronous  spiking  ( Kumar,  Rotter, and Aert- 
sen, 2010 ). It is unlikely  that sparse events alone can completely  capture  
both of these modes. Second,  the fact that connectivity  estimators  based 
on both amplitude  (e.g., Pearson  correlation)  and phase (e.g., instanta-  
neous phase synchrony)  modulation  that have been shown to contain  
meaningful  information  ( Allen et al., 2011 ; Omidvarnia  et al., 2016 ) 
suggests  that sparse events based only on amplitude  in the space-time  
domain  may give incomplete  results.  
We evaluated  our premise  by concentrating  on the default mode as it 
is arguably  the most detected/studied  functional  pattern  in event-based  
studies and is commonly  used to support  the discrete  nature of func- 
tional patterns  in the spontaneous  BOLD signal. We ﬁrst asked whether  
the default mode pattern  is present  only in its so-called  EPTs or whether  
it can also be identiﬁed  from the event absent time points (EATs),  i.e., 
time points with the least (almost  zero) probability  of being EPTs. Ad- 
ditionally,  we explored  whether  the default mode EPTs contain  simi- 
lar functional  connectivity  information  as the full data in the context  of 
their associations  with a diagnosis  of schizophrenia  and with schizophre-  
nia symptoms.  Finally,  we asked whether  the (usually  ignored)  EATs of 
the default mode could provide  additional  unique information  about 
schizophrenia.  
It should be mentioned  that this study evaluates  if default mode net- 
work continuously  contributes  to the BOLD signal, including  the time 
points with the least probability  of being EPTs. This is in contrast  to 
earlier studies that assess the eﬀect of scan length on the reliability  
of estimating  static functional  connectivity  ( Birn et al., 2013 ). Further-  
more, while the term “co-activation  pattern/map  ”is commonly  used to 
describe  spatial patterns  identiﬁed  by event-detection  approaches,  the 
term co-activation  pattern  (CAP) also refers to a speciﬁc  category  of 
event detection  approaches  ( Liu, Zhang, Chang, and Duyn, 2018 ), and 
the term co-activation  has also been used in other contexts,  such as de- 
scribing  task co-activation  patterns  across fMRI studies ( Eickhoﬀet  al., 
2011 ; Toro, Fox, and Paus, 2008 ). Therefore,  we opted for the term acti- 
vation spatial maps (ASMs)  to describe  the ﬁrst-order  activation  patterns  
that are being evaluated  in this study to avoid confusion.  Furthermore,  
to simplify  notation  in the remainder  of this paper, unless we explicitly  
indicate  otherwise,  the terms EATs and EPTs refer to the EATs and EPTs 
of the default mode.

2.1. Patient selection  and inclusion  criteria 
Candidates  were right-handed  patients  aﬀected  by a glioma in the 
left hemisphere  requiring  the complete  or the partial exposure  of the 
parietal  lobe. Neuroradiological  inclusion  criteria  were applied  irre- 
spective  of tumor location,  based on an extensive  and multidisciplinary  
preoperative  evaluation  involving  standard  MR studies (T1, FLAIR and 
DWI) (Philips  Intera 3T scanner,  Best). Patients  with tumor occupying  
more than 10 cc of the parietal  lobe, were not included.  Patients  who 
received  previous  neurosurgical  treatment  and/or patients  that showed  
preoperative  sensorimotor  and/or praxis deﬁcits  were not included.  Sen- 
sorimotor  deﬁcits  were assessed  by means of standard  neurological  ex- 
amination  and Action Research  Arm Test (ARAT)  test, while upper limb 
apraxia  has been assessed  by means of De Renzi test. All patients  gave 
written  informed  consent  to the surgical  and mapping  procedure  and to 
use of data for research  purposes,  which followed  the principles  outlined  
in the “World  Medical  Association  Declaration  of Helsinki:  Research  in- 
volving  human subjects"".  The study was performed  with strict adherence  
to the routine  procedure  normally  utilized  for surgical  tumor removal.  
Finally,  thirty-four  right-handed  patients  were enrolled  in this study 
(mean age 46 ± 12.5 SD, range 25-75, n = 19 with high-grade  glioma;  
n = 14 with low-grade  glioma,  n = 1 others).  Selected  patients  showed  
a normal  score for the upper limb apraxia  (De Renzi test), no basic sen- 
sory and motor deﬁcits  (neurological  examination)  and scored 57 (the 
highest  score) in the Action Research  Arm test (ARAT).  Among  them, 
in 20 patients  the tumor was growing  in parietal  areas (mean volume  
of 9.79cc ± 8.2), in 8 patients  in the frontal lobe not inﬁltrating  the 
precentral  gyrus (mean volume  11.95cc  ± 8.47) and in 6 patients  in the 
temporal  lobe (mean volume  16.8cc ± 5.68). The main aim of the study 
was to investigate  the parietal  lobe and, due to the surgical  approach,

the most extensive  exploration  was allowed  mainly when the tumor was 
located  within the parietal  white matter.  In order to overcome  as much 
as possible  the eﬀects due to the presence  of the tumor within the inves- 
tigated area, we selected  patients  with a parietal  tumor volume  not ex- 
ceeding  the 10 cc. Only two patients  exceeding  this value were included,  
since their responses  ﬁtted spatially  with the overall stimulation  sample 
of eﬀective  sites. Among  frontal and temporal  tumors,  we selected  pa- 
tients requiring,  for clinical  need, to have the postcentral  gyrus and/or 
the inferior  parietal  lobe exposed  and to execute  HMt. 
2.2. Intraoperative  procedure  
Total intravenous  anesthesia  with Propofol  and Remifentanil  was 
used, and no muscle relaxants  were employed  during surgery  to allow 
mapping  of motor responses.  A craniotomy  was performed  to expose 
the tumor area and a limited amount  of surrounding  tissue. Surgery  was 
performed  in all patients  under asleep-awake-asleep  anesthesia,  with 
the aid of the neurophysiological  Brain Mapping  and Monitoring  tech- 
niques ( Bello et al. 2014 ). The resection  was stopped  according  to func- 
tional boundaries,  preserving  motor, praxis, language,  visual and cogni- 
tive functions  ( Conti Nibali et al., 2020 , Rossi et al. 2021 , 2021 , 2018 ).

rovascular  confounds,  motion artefacts  and low-reliability  ( Tsvetanov  
et al., 2021 ). 
Magnetoencephalography  (MEG) has been proposed  as a valuable  
alternative  tool for functional  biomarkers  of early-stage  AD. MEG has a 
better temporal  resolution  to measure  brain function,  is reliable  across 
sessions  ( Colclough  et al., 2016 ; Garcés et al., 2016 ; Martín-Buro  et al., 
2016 ) and is not confounded  by neurovascular  variance.  While Elec- 
troencephalography  (EEG) can also measure  neural activity  directly  like 
MEG, it does not oﬀer the same spatial resolution,  or potential  to mea- 
sure changes  in the brain’s functional  connectome  (see López-Sanz  et al., 
2017 ; Maestúet  al., 2019 , for a more detailed  discussion  of the potential  
advantages  of MEG for detecting  AD). 
MEG oﬀers a large set of potential  data features  that might diﬀer- 
entiate individuals  with MCI from healthy  controls.  These features  may 
be limited to speciﬁc  frequencies  of oscillatory  activity,  speciﬁc  brain 
regions,  or the functional  connectivity  between  brain regions.  The spa- 
tiotemporal  complexity  of MEG is well suited for machine/deep  learning  
techniques  to identify  those features  that enable the classiﬁcation  of MCI 
( Maestúet  al., 2015 ). However,  these techniques  typically  need a large 
number  of cases to train and test the classiﬁers.  While large datasets  of 
MRI scans of MCI cases have been made available  to the community  
(e.g., Jack et al., 2008 ; Mueller  et al., 2005 ), comparable  datasets  of 
MEG are required.  
In the recent “BioFIND  ”p r o j e c t ,  funded by the European  Union’s  
Joint Programming  For Neurodegenerative  Research  initiative  ( Hughes  
et al., 2019 ), we combined  168 MEG datasets  from a number  of on- 
going dementia  projects  at the University  of Cambridge,  England,  and 
the Centre for Biomedical  Technology  in Madrid,  Spain. Since then, we 
have added further data, nearly doubling  the total to 324 participants,  
approximately  half of whom had MCI (according  to NIA-AA  criteria,  
Albert et al., 2011 ), while the rest were healthy  controls.  Participants  
contributed  2–13 min of resting-state  MEG, plus a T1-weighted  struc- 
tural MRI scan in most cases. The MRI can be used to help localise  
the cortical  sources  of the MEG data, and also to compare  classiﬁcation  
based on MEG with that based on the more commonly  used structural  
MRI. 
Here we describe  this extended  BioFIND  dataset,  in the hope that 
it will allow others to investigate  aspects  of brain function  that dif- 
fer in MCI patients  versus controls,  and hopefully  identify  potential  
biomarkers  for early AD. While some of the data were reported  in 
our previous  paper ( Hughes  et al., 2019 ), those data were not made 
available,  nor were they in a shareable  format.  Here we have con- 
verted the data to the international  BIDS format ( Gorgolewski  et al., 
2016 ; Niso et al., 2018 ), which includes  meta-data  on a number  of 
other relevant  factors,  and describe  how the data can be analysed  
on the DPUK platform  ( Bauermeister  et al., 2020 ) ( https://portal.  
dementiasplatform.uk/Apply  ). We report an example  preprocessing  
(feature  extraction)  and classiﬁcation  approach,  to conﬁrm  basic data 
quality,  but emphasize  that this is not supposed  to be an optimised  ap- 
proach and that the main aim of this paper is to describe  the data in 
suﬃcient  detail that others can test their own preprocessing  and classi- 
ﬁcation  approaches.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
The 324 participants  consist of 158 people with clinically  diagnosed  
MCI and 166 controls,  recorded  at one of two sites: 1) the MRC Cog- 
nition & Brain Sciences  Unit (CBU) at the University  of Cambridge,  
and 2) the Laboratory  of Cognitive  and Computational  Neuroscience  at 
the Centre for Biomedical  Technology  (CTB), Madrid.  The participants  
were pooled over a number  of diﬀerent  projects,  each approved  by local 
Ethics Committees  and following  the 1991 Declaration  of Helsinki.  Par- 
ticipants  consented  to the collection  and sharing  of de-identiﬁed  data 
for research  purposes.  The 68 MCI patients  scanned  at Cambridge  were recruited  from spe- 
cialist memory  clinics at Cambridge  University  Hospitals  NHS Trust. In- 
dividuals  were diagnosed  with MCI after referral  for symptoms,  mainly 
memory  problems  (i.e., they were not derived  by screening  of cogni- 
tively asymptomatic  people).  The diagnosis  was made in a regional  
memory  clinic, including  ACE/ACER  and MMSE tests as standard,  with 
a signiﬁcant  deﬁcit in memory  domain  tests. PET and ﬂuidic Biomark-  
ers were not used as standard,  although  all had structural  brain imaging  
(usually  MRI in the clinic unless contraindicated,  when a CT was oc- 
casionally  used) and clinical  follow-up  in support  of the diagnosis.  By 
deﬁnition  of MCI, suﬀerers  had functional  independence  at the time of 
diagnosis.  MRI was used to exclude  other pathologies  and to identify  
features  consistent  with MCI/AD  pathology  (e.g. MTL atrophy  without  
mass lesion, high vascular  burden).  Patients  had no obvious  major psy- 
chiatric  disorder.  
The 91 controls  from Cambridge  were selected  from the population-  
derived  CamCAN  cohort of healthy  people from the same geographic  
region ( www.cam-can.org  ), chosen to have similar age and sex distri- 
bution.  The CBU controls  are screened  to be healthy,  i.e., have MMSE 
(and indeed ACE-R)  scores above conventional  cut-oﬀs,  as well as 
other screening  described  in the CamCAN  protocol  paper ( Shafto et al., 
2014 ). 
The 90 patients  and the 75 controls  from Madrid  were recruited  from 
the Neurology  and Geriatric  Departments  of the University  Hospital  San 
Carlos. The MCI diagnosis  of the patients  was determined  with interme-  
diate probability  according  to the National  Institute  on Aging–Alzheimer  
Association  criteria  ( Albert et al., 2011 ), i.e., given by a clinician  based 
on clinical  and cognitive  tests, self- and informant-report,  and in the ab- 
sence of full dementia  or obvious  other causes. For some patients,  there 
was additional  biomarker  evidence  of atrophy  from MRI or long-term  
follow up and genotyping  for the APOE 𝜀 4 allele. The diagnosis  required  
an objective  impairment  in the memory  domain  and/or other cognitive  
functions,  but a subjective  ""memory  complaint""  was not required,  and 
(as a requirement  for the diagnosis  criteria),  they were able to still per- 
form their daily living activities.  MRI (T1, T2 and/or FLAIR) was used to 
rule out a vascular  disorder,  and any other type of neurological  disease  
(i.e., tumour,  stroke, infection)  that could better explain  the cognitive  
symptoms.  
The CTB controls  had a full neuropsychological  assessment  to con- 
ﬁrm normal  cognition,  and the same type of MRI assessment  as that 
done in the MCI group, i.e., a radiologist  reported  MRIs as normal.  All 
participants  were free of any signiﬁcant  neurological  or psychiatric  dis- 
order, including  vascular  damage  (Hachinski  score equal or less than 4, 
plus observation  of T2-weighted  MRI) and depression  (geriatric  depres-  
sion score equal or less than 5), or any medication  with known eﬀects 
on MEG activity.  
Note that the MRI (and MEG) data provided  here were research  scans 
following  diagnosis,  and were not used to inform the diagnosis,  though 
other similar (T1-weighted)  clinical  MRIs may have been used by the 
diagnosing  clinician.  For a subset of MCI patients,  we indicate  whether  
or not they subsequently  progressed  to dementia  ( “probable  AD ”) over 
subsequent  years, according  to their managing  clinician.  
The distributions  of participant  sex, age, education,  and score on a 
cognitive  test for dementia  - the Mini-Mental  State Examination  (MMSE)  
- are shown in Table 1 . As expected  (since part of the diagnosis),  the MCI 
group scored lower on the MMSE, with most below the common  clinical  
threshold  of 27 ( O’Bryant  et al., 2008 ). While MMSE may lack sensitiv-  
ity to MCI, its widespread  use, approval  as a clinical  trial outcome  and 
multiple  language  versions  make it a suitable  screening  tool. T-tests con- 
ﬁrmed that the MCI group was also slightly  older and less well educated  
on average,  though there was considerable  variance  across patients  and 
appreciable  overlap  between  them and the controls,  enabling  subgroup  
matching  where relevant  to future analyses.  
Note that comparable  resting-state  MEG data (and T1-weighted  
MRIs) acquired  at the CBU site are also available  for approxi-  
mately 600 healthy  participants  (aged 18-88 years) via the Cam-

CAN website:  https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/  
(though  see README.txt  ﬁle below for the subset in both datasets).  
These data could be used with machine  learning  to characterise  healthy  
MEG data or predict age, which could then be tested on the present  
patient data. 
2.2. Resting-state  Protocol  
The MEG data were recorded  while participants  were asked to keep 
their eyes closed, instructed  to think of nothing  speciﬁc,  but not fall 
asleep. The duration  of these recordings  varied from 2 to 13 min 
( Table 1 ). A Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test showed  that the duration  of the 
median  MEG recording  was longer in controls.  It is therefore  recom- 
mended  that data are trimmed  so that the same duration  is used for all 
participants  (since levels of drowsiness  might increase  for longer record-  
ings). 
The precise date and time of recording  were scrambled  in the 
FIFF ﬁle using the “mne_anonymize  ”function  ( https://mne.tools/dev/  
generated/commands.html#mne-anonymize  ) of the MNE software  
( Gramfort  et al., 2013 ), to reduce the risk of participant  identiﬁcation.  
Nonetheless,  in case they are relevant  to the MEG data quality,  the time 
of day and the year of the recording  are provided  in the participants.tsv  
ﬁle. As can be seen in Table 1 , the time of day (Recoding  Hour) did not 
diﬀer between  patients  and controls.  The data for patients  were recorded  
approximately  a year earlier on average  than those for controls,  though 
again there was large overlap  in the Recoding  Year ( Table 1 ). While 
there is no obvious  reason why data quality should change over years, 
we also provide  empty-room  data for each year and site, to enable esti- 
mation of changes  in ambient  noise levels. 
Some of the participants  performed  other tasks in the MEG scanner  
prior to the resting-state  phase. The median  and range of the duration  
(in minutes)  of such tasks are shown in Table 1 , and did not diﬀer signif- 
icantly between  patients  and controls.  However,  performing  such tasks 
could aﬀect the resting-state  data (e.g, make participants  more tired), so 
can be used as a confounding  covariate.  The nature of the tasks varied. 
For CBU data, sub-Sub0127  to sub-Sub0155  task performed  a seman- 
tic judgment  task on auditory  sentences  followed  by a visual word (as 
described  in Olichney  et al., 2008 ), while sub-Sub0156  to sub-Sub0168  
performed  an auditory  MisMatch  Negativity  (MMN)  task (as described  
in Hughes  and Rowe, 2013 ). For CTB data, if any participant  performed  
a task, it was a delayed-match-to-sample  task (as described  in Serrano  
et al., 2020 ). For CBU participants  for whom tasks were done before the 
resting-state,  the scanner  was stopped  in between,  so the resting-state  
was a new FIF ﬁle. For some CTB participants  for whom tasks were 
done before the resting-state,  the scanner  was not stopped,  so a single FIF ﬁle was saved, but a new FIF ﬁle for the resting-state  section was 
subsequently  extracted  using the MNE “trim ”function.

cerebral  microstructural  tissue integrity  using qMRI metrics,  including,  
most prominently,  relaxation  rates ( R 1 and R 2 ) and diﬀusion  tensor 
imaging  (DTI) indices of fractional  anisotropy  (FA) and mean diﬀusiv-  
ity (MD) ( Chiang et al., 2012 ; Operto et al., 2018 , 2019 ; Williams  et al., 
2019 b; Westlye  et al., 2012 ; Luo et al., 2019 ); these metrics  have all been 
shown to represent  sensitive  probes of tissue microstructural  integrity.  
The results of these studies were, overall,  interpreted  in terms of the 
diﬀerential  eﬀect of APOE genotypes  on myelin production  and mainte-  
nance. Indeed,  the APOE protein  is tightly involved  in the transport  and 
clearance  of cholesterol  and lipids, which are the main constituents  of 
myelin.  However,  while sensitive  to myelin content,  none of these MR 
metrics  are speciﬁc,  so that the association  between  APOE genotype  and 
myelination  remains  to be established.  
Advanced  MR methods  based on multicomponent  relaxometry  to 
assess myelin water fraction  (MWF),  a surrogate  of myelin content,  
have led to much greater speciﬁcity  in noninvasive  MRI myelin map- 
ping ( MacKay  and Laule, 2016 ; MacKay  et al., 1994 ; Alonso-Ortiz  et al., 
2015 ). Using advanced  MRI physics  and technology,  a whole-brain  MWF 
map can now be obtained  in less than 15 min using the multicomponent  
driven equilibrium  single pulse observation  of T 1 and T 2 (mcDESPOT)  
analysis  ( Dean et al., 2015 , 2013 , 2008 , 2017 ). In pioneering  work, us- 
ing mcDESPOT-based  MWF imaging,  Dean and colleagues  showed  sig- 
niﬁcantly  lower myelin content  in various  brain regions  of infants who 
were carriers  of the APOE 𝜀 4 allele as compared  to measurements  de- 
rived from noncarriers  ( Dean et al., 2014 ). This ﬁnding  has been recently  
corroborated  in a longitudinal  study, conducted  on a large cohort of in- 
fants and young children  ( Remer et al., 2020 ), while also suggesting  
the possibility  that 𝜀 4 carriers  have altered rates of cerebral  myelina-  
tion and cognitive  development  in childhood.  These compelling  results 
support  a direct role of APOE in early neurodevelopment  and myelina-  
tion. However,  to the best of our knowledge,  studies investigating  the 
diﬀerential  associations  between  the APOE 𝜀 2 or APOE 𝜀 4 alleles and 
cerebral  myelination,  as measured  using MWF, in adult subjects  have 
not been undertaken.  
Here, we investigated  the association  between  APOE isoforms  and re- 
gional myelin content  in a relatively  large cohort of well-characterized  
adults without  cognitive  impairment  ( N = 92), across the extended  age 
range of 24 to 94 years. The inclusion  of subjects  across a wide age 
range ensures  a large dynamic  range for myelin content  measurements.  
Myelin content  was measured  using the Bayesian  Monte Carlo (BMC)-  
mcDESPOT-based  MWF method  ( Bouhrara  and Spencer,  2016 , 2017 ). 
We also measured  longitudinal  and transverse  relaxation  rates ( R 1 and 
R 2 ), sensitive  measures  of myelin,  to provide  contact  with previous  stud- 
ies. Thus, the main goal of this work is to characterize  the regional  asso- 
ciations  between  cerebral  myelination  and APOE isoforms  in cognitively  
unimpaired  adults. 
2. Material  & methods  
2.1. Study cohort 
Participants  were drawn from the Baltimore  Longitudinal  Study 
of Aging (BLSA) and the Genetic  and Epigenetic  Signatures  of Trans- 
lational  Aging Laboratory  Testing  (GESTALT)  study ( Ferrucci,  2008 ; 
Shock, 1985 ). The goal of the BLSA and GESTALT  studies is to evaluate  
multiple  biomarkers  related to aging, and their inclusion  and exclusion  
criteria  are essentially  identical.  Participants  were excluded  if they have 
metallic  implants,  or major neurologic  or medical  disorders.  All partic- 
ipants were administered  the Mini Mental State Examination  (MMSE)  
test. Experimental  procedures  were performed  in compliance  with our 
local Institutional  Review  Board, and participants  provided  written  in- 
formed  consent.  
2.2. MR imaging  
MRI scans were performed  on a 3T whole body Philips MRI system 
(Achieva,  Best, The Netherlands)  using the internal  quadrature  body coil for transmission  and an eight-channel  phased-array  head coil for 
reception.  Each participant  underwent  our BMC-mcDESPOT  protocol  
for MWF, R 1 , and R 2 mapping  ( Bouhrara  and Spencer,  2017 ; 2016 ). 
This imaging  protocol  consisted  of 3D spoiled  gradient  recalled  echo 
(SPGR)  images acquired  with ﬂip angles (FAs) of [2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 
18 20]°, echo time (TE) of 1.37 ms, repetition  time (TR) of 5 ms, with 
an acquisition  time of ∼5 min, as well as 3D balanced  steady state free 
precession  (bSSFP)  images acquired  with FAs of [2 4 7 11 16 24 32 40 
50 60]°, TE of 2.8 ms, TR of 5.8 ms, and acquisition  time of ∼6 min. 
The bSSFP images were acquired  with radiofrequency  (RF) excitation  
pulse phase increments  of 0 or 𝜋to account  for oﬀ-resonance  eﬀects for 
a total scan time of ∼12 min ( ∼6 min for each phase-cycling  scan). All 
SPGR and bSSFP images were acquired  with an acquisition  matrix of 
150 ×130 ×94, voxel size 1.6 mm ×1.6 mm ×1.6 mm. Further,  we 
used the double-angle  method  (DAM) to correct for excitation  RF inho- 
mogeneity  ( Stollberger  and Wach, 1996 ). For that, two fast spin-echo  
images were acquired  with FAs of 45° and  90°, TE of 102 ms, TR of 
3000 ms, acquisition  voxel size of 2.6 mm ×2.6 mm ×4 mm, and ac- 
quisition  time of ∼4 min. All images were acquired  with a ﬁeld-of-view  
of 240 mm ×208 mm ×150 mm, SENSE factor of 2, and reconstructed  
to a voxel size of 1 mm ×1 mm ×1 mm. The total acquisition  time was 
∼21 min. We emphasize  that all MRI studies and ancillary  measure-  
ments were performed  with the same MRI system,  running  the same 
pulse sequences,  and at the same facility for both BLSA and GESTALT  
participants.

2.2. Participant  details 
Analyses  used data from a total of 546 individuals  who had data for 
at least one task (237 male/309  female;  M age = 28.67 years, SD age = 0.63 
years, range = 28 - 32 years): n = 443 for the antisaccade  task, n = 488 
for the keep track task, and n = 480 for the number–letter  task; 358 
participants  had usable data for all three scanner  tasks. These individu-  
als were a subset of the initial sample scanned  (587 individuals),  after 
data were removed  due to incidental  anatomical  ﬁndings  or excessive  
movement  during the scanning  session based on the criteria  of greater 
than 3 mm translation  (motion  in x, y, or z plane) or 3°rotation  (roll, 
pitch, or yaw motion).  Participants  were part of the Longitudinal  Twin 
Study (LTS), a long-term  longitudinal  study of twins in Colorado  re- 
cruited from the Colorado  Twin Registry  based on birth records  (see 
Corley et al., 2019 ; Rhea et al., 2006 , 2013 ), for additional  informa-  
tion). Of the 546 individuals,  there were 119 pairs of monozygotic  (MZ) 
twins, 109 pairs of dizygotic  (DZ) twins, 41 MZ twin singletons,  and 49 
DZ twin singletons.  Singletons  are members  of twin pairs whose cotwins  
either did not participate  or were excluded  from analysis.  Based on self- 
report, the entire LTS sample is 92.6% White, 5.0% more than one race, 
< 1% American  Indian/Alaskan  Native,  < 1% Paciﬁc Islander,  and 1.2%

ther focused  on cortical  regions  ( Ngo et al., 2021 ) or relied on pre- 
determined  brain parcellations  to make predictions  within small patches  
of brain and concatenate  the results ( Cohen et al., 2020; Dohmatob  
et al., 2021 ). Here, we are interested  in activations  across the whole 
brain, not necessarily  limited to the cortex. Furthermore,  our model 
uses global features,  because  parcellating  the brain into small patches  
a priori may introduce  more free-parameters  and increase  the risk of 
over-ﬁtting.  More importantly,  these approaches  did not attempt  to ex- 
plicitly model cross-subject  variability  of the rest and task states per se , 
and thus may be sub-optimal  to capture  cross-subject  variations.  In con- 
trast, Ngo et al. (2021) introduced  a contrastive  loss in combination  with 
the common  loss to maximise  inter-individual  diﬀerences  in cortical  re- 
gions. However,  in practice,  such loss functions  are often non-convex  
and may have complicated  behaviours  (e.g., multiple  local minima)  ren- 
dering optimisation  diﬃcult  ( Boyd et al., 2004 ). To fully account  for the 
inter-individual  variations,  an alternative  is to explicitly  train on residu- 
alised data, i.e., residuals  where group-average  information  has been re- 
gressed  out. The data obtained  in this way has minimal  shared variance  
with the group-level  information,  thus serves as a cleaner  description  of 
individual-level  diﬀerences.  
Accurate  prediction  of individual  diﬀerences  in task-fMRI  response  
using resting-state  fMRI has a number  of potential  applications.  In a 
clinical  setting,  considerable  variability  across patients  makes it diﬃ- 
cult for surgeons  to rely on anatomy  (or population-averaged  task acti- 
vation maps) when ﬁnding  eloquent  surgical  targets.  Task-fMRI  can be 
used to localise  surgical  targets more accurately  for individual  patients,  
often by asking them to perform  a speciﬁc  cognitive/sensory-motor  task. 
However,  in practice,  task-fMRI  localisers  are often limited by the pa- 
tients’ poor performance  (or, the patients  are unable to perform  the task) 
and measurement  noise. As a stable trait marker,  resting-state  fMRI has 
proved a good alternative  to task-fMRI  localisers,  without  the need of 
task execution  prior to an operation.  Accurate  predictions  of task-fMRI  
localisers  using resting-state  fMRI can therefore  greatly beneﬁt surgical  
targetting.  Furthermore,  having a better rest-predict-task  model may im- 
prove our understanding  of the mechanisms  underlying  individual  dif- 
ferences  in resting-state  and task-fMRI.  
Here we propose  a framework  that explicitly  models individual  
variations  in task-evoked  brain activity  using the resting-state  vari- 
ability, the latter proﬁled  by a set of common  spatial modes derived  
from a recently  developed  technique,  Stochastic  Probabilistic  Functional  
Modes (sPROFUMO).  We show that, consistent  with previous  studies 
( Farahibozorg  et al., 2021; Harrison  et al., 2020; 2015 ), sPROFUMO  
provides  better sets of “bases ”(later referred  to as PFMs) to reconstruct  
the variations  in task-evoked  activation  patterns  than the widely used 
dual-regression.  Additionally,  we show that an ensemble  learner that 
combines  global and local bases has improved  capacity  of not only re- 
producing  typical activation  patterns  but also preserved  patterns  unique 
to individuals.  We demonstrate  that modelling  of individual-level  task 
contrast  maps comprises  the modelling  of two separate  sources  of vari- 
ability, shape of activations  and the overall activation  strength.  Consid-  
ering these two aspects  separately  in task prediction  is at least as eﬀec- 
tive as or even more desirable  than simply modelling  the original  task 
contrast  maps. Furthermore,  the proposed  model can recapitulate  the 
spatial patterns  of inter-individual  variability,  recovering  regions  that 
are more variable  at the group-level.  The model achieves  state of the art 
prediction  accuracy  for both datasets,  and is also on par with task test- 
retest reliability.  These results demonstrate  the potential  of resting-state  
features  to reproduce  task-fMRI  features,  and serve as a supplement  to 
task localisers  in pre-surgical  plannings.  
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. UK Biobank  data 
UK Biobank  (UKB) is a large national  project that collects  a wide 
range of health-related  measures  for over 500,000  subjects,  initially  aged between  40 and 69. We used the resting-state  and task functional  
MRI data from a total of 17,560 subjects.  The acquisition  parameters  
and processing  details can be found in Miller et al. (2016) , Alfaro- 
Almagro  et al. (2018) . Brieﬂy,  all resting-state  fMRI scans were acquired  
with identical  scanners  (3T Siemens  Skyra) with a TR of 735ms for a to- 
tal of 490 time points for each individual.  After the initial preprocessing,  
the data were ICA-FIX  cleaned  to remove  structured  artefacts  ( Salimi- 
Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), and then registered  to the standard  MNI space. 
Next, each individual’s  resting-state  4D time series were further spa- 
tially smoothed  with a Gaussian  kernel of sigma 3mm. The task used 
is the Hariri faces/shapes  “emotion  ”t a s k ( Barch et al., 2013; Hariri 
et al., 2002 ), scanned  and processed  under the same protocols  as the 
resting-state  data (except  that the task-fMRI  data is not ICA-denoised).  
Individual  as well as group-average  activation  z-statistic  maps of three 
contrasts  (faces, shapes,  and faces-shapes)  were estimated  from the task 
fMRI scans using FEAT ( Woolrich  et al., 2004; 2001 ). Additionally,  473 
subjects  in this 17,560 subset received  second-time  scanning  (mean test- 
retest-interval  2.25 years, std 0.12). These second-time  scans provided  
test-retest  reliability  scores as a benchmark  for our model performance.  
2.2. Human connectome  project data 
We used the MSMAll-registered  data provided  by 
the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP), S1200 Release  
( https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult  ). De- 
tails on the acquisition  protocols  and processing  pipelines  can be found 
in Van Essen et al. (2013) , Glasser  et al. (2013) , Robinson  et al. (2014) . 
Resting-state  and task fMRI data from 991 subjects,  aged 22 to 35 
years, were used in the analysis.  Each individual  had four runs 
of resting-state  scans with a TR of 0.72s for a total of 1200 time 
points per run. The data were ICA-FIX  denoised  to remove  the ef- 
fect of structured  artefacts  automatically,  then resampled  onto the 
“32k_fs_LR  ” grayordinates  space and minimally-smoothed  by 2mm 
FWHM.  All subjects  were MSMAll-registered  to improve  functional  
and structural  alignment  ( Robinson  et al., 2014 ). To further in- 
crease the signal-to-noise  ratio, an additional  smoothing  of 4mm 
FWHM was applied  to the MSMAll-registered  data (with subcor-  
tical structures  smoothed  within parcel boundaries,  and cortical  
data smoothed  in 2D on the surface)  using the Connectome  Work- 
bench ( https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-  
workbench  ). The task fMRI scans were acquired  and pre-processed  in 
the same way (though  without  FIX). We used the MSMAll-registered  
individual  and group-average  contrast  maps with 4mm FWHM smooth-  
ing in the analysis,  including  47 contrasts  across seven task domains  
( Barch et al., 2013 ). 
Similarly  to the UKB dataset,  we used the HCP repeat scans as the 
reliability  benchmark  for the predictions.  Among  the 991 subjects,  43 
have received  second-time  scanning  under the same 3T imaging  and be- 
haviour  protocols  with test-retest-interval  ranging  from 18 to 328 days 
(mean 134.78;  std 62.49).

Incomplete  or non-usable  data is not shared (see Table 1 for an 
overview  of the number  of participants  and pairs for which data is 
shared).  First, two participants  from diﬀerent  pairs exceeded  our age 
criteria  and misunderstood  instructions,  leaving  140 individual  partici-  
pants, and 69 complete  pairs. 
MRI data from a total of 16 participants  were excluded  due to MRI 
scanner/software  malfunction  ( n = 6); missing  data due to participant  
claustrophobia  ( n = 4); excessive  motion within or between  sessions  
( n = 3); bad performance  on the one-back  task ( n = 2); and experimenter  
error ( n = 1); see the Participants  folder in the Dataset  for more details.  
Note that exclusion  of MRI data based on motion or one-back  perfor- 
mance was only done for extreme  cases. Researchers  may still want to 
deal with motion artifacts  and/or errors in the one-back  task while pre- 
processing  and analysing  the shared data. 
There are 124 individual  participants  and 56 complete  pairs with 
complete  and shared (f)MRI data. Furthermore,  (f)MRI data of three

extra participants  is still shared because  only session three is incomplete  
and this may be irrelevant  for some users of the data. 
Audio/video  data from the interactive  sessions  are shared in the 
Dataset,  except for seven cases where one or both participants  did not 
provide  consent.  We focused  our transcription  resources  on a selection  
of 47 interactions,  based on their (audio)  quality and completeness  of 
the MRI data (see above).  However,  audio/video  data is shared for 42 of 
these pairs, four pairs contain  individuals  with non-usable  MRI data, and 
questionnaire  data are missing  for one pair (these issues were encoun-  
tered only after transcription  had ﬁnished).  Thus, all data (i.e., fMRI, 
behavioural,  and transcription/interaction  data) is usable for 42 pairs 
(84 participants)  in total. For 37 of these 42 pairs, thanks to participant  
consent,  the video and audio data can be shared as well.

2.1. Dataset 
We used rs-fMRI  data of the HCP 1200-subjects  release ( https://  
www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/  ). After consult-  
ing with the Safety Management  Division  at RIKEN,  we conﬁrmed  
that institutional  approval  was not required  for the use of the HCP dataset.  Each fMRI image was acquired  with a temporal  resolution  of 
0.72 s and a 2 mm isotropic  spatial resolution  using a customized  3-T 
Siemens  Skyra scanner  ( Smith et al., 2013 ). Individual  subjects  under- 
went four rs-fMRI  runs of 14.4 min each (1200 frames per run), with 
eyes open, with a relaxed  ﬁxation  on a projected  bright cross-hair  on a 
dark background.  The rs-fMRI  data were preprocessed  with the HCP 
spatial and temporal  preprocessing  pipelines.  Brieﬂy,  spatial prepro-  
cessing included  spatial distortion  correction,  motion correction,  and 
transformation  to the Montreal  Neurological  Institute  template  space 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). Temporal  preprocessing  included  high-pass  tem- 
poral ﬁltering  (cutoﬀ of  2000s),  ICA-FIX  cleanup,  and motion-related  
time-course  removal  ( Smith et al., 2013 ). Details on the ICA-FIX  cleanup  
have previously  been described  ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi  
et al., 2014 ). Our analysis  began with the preprocessed  rs-fMRI  data 
(e.g., rfMRI_REST1_LR_hp2000_clean.nii.gz  ). 
We selected  59 behavioral  measures  from the HCP dataset,  which 
cover seven behavioral  categories,  i.e., cognition,  alertness,  motor, sen- 
sory, in-scanner  task performance,  personality,  and emotion  (Supple-  
mentary  Table 1). These behavioral  measures  were comprised  of 58 
measures  used in a previous  study ( Liégeois  et al., 2019 ) and a mea- 
sure (i.e., CogFluidComp_Unadj  ). In addition  to the 59 measures,  we used 
ﬁve subject demographics,  i.e., age ( Age_in_Yrs  ), gender ( Gender ), race 
( Race ), education  ( SSAGA_Educ  ), and percentage  of rs-fMRI  scan com- 
pletion ( 3T_RS-fMRI_PctCompl  ). 
The HCP 1200-subjects  release includes  data on 1206 healthy  young 
adult subjects.  For our analysis,  we selected  subjects  who met the fol- 
lowing conditions:  (i) Subjects  with no missing  data for the 59 behav- 
ioral measures  and ﬁve subject demographics;  (ii) Subjects  who com- 
pleted all the rs-fMRI  runs (i.e., 3T_RS-fMRI_PctCompl  ); (iii) Subjects  who 
scored ≥ 27 on the Mini-Mental  State Examination  (i.e., MMSE_Score  ) 
( O’Bryant  et al., 2008 ); (iv) Subjects  who clearly reported  their race 
(i.e., we excluded  subjects  with ”Unknown  or Not Reported  ”); and (v) 
Subjects  with head motion ≤ 0.15 in all the rs-fMRI  runs (i.e., Move-

attitudes  regarding  race as a consequential  demographic  inﬂuencing  the 
replicability  of ﬁndings.  Moreover,  the review aims to draw attention  
to issues of diverse  participant  recruitment  as it relates to the gener- 
alizability  of research  conclusions  and the perpetuation  of inaccurate  
descriptions  of neurological  normalcy.  
2. Methods  
A systematic  approach  was employed  to explore  the racial demo- 
graphics  of participants  in EEG and MRI research.  We narrowed  the 
scope of the search to the top ﬁve journals  in cognitive  neuroscience  
according  to their SCImago  Journal  Rank (SJR) Score in 2019. Because  
three of these ﬁve selected  journals  predominantly  publish  review ar- 
ticles, the search was restricted  to EEG and MRI research  published  in 
Cerebral  Cortex (2019) and NeuroImage  (2019) , reﬂecting  modern  prac- 
tices in cognitive  neuroscience.  These methods  yielded  536 articles  (Ta- 
ble S1 of supplement),  and papers that reported  their participants’  racial 
demographics  were isolated  ( Table 1 ). 
Further,  racial demographic  information  was collected  for the in- 
stitutions  and cities through  which the research  took place to provide  
contextual  information  about the populations  from which participants  
were recruited.  Because  race/ethnicity  constructs  vary by country,  these 
additional  institutional  and city-wide  demographics  were only supple-  
mented  for research  conducted  in the United States or regions  with sim- 
ilar bureaucratically  prescribed  guidelines.  These demographics  were 
collected  from the 2019 US Census and oﬃcial diversity  reports.",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5466, 5469), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(2782, 2787), match='  \n3.'>"

brain, are still poorly understood  not only in the quantitative  but also 
in the qualitative  sense. 
CSF ﬂow associated  with the cardiac  cycle is well-established  and 
has been characterized  as a predominantly  pulsatile  movement  of 
CSF by cardiac-gated  phase-contrast  MRI ( Feinberg  and Mark, 1987 ; 
Schroth  and Klose, 1992 ). Simultaneous  measurement  of CSF and blood 
ﬂow (both arterial  and venous)  has revealed  that these CSF pulsations  
may be generated  by total cerebral  blood volume  (CBV) changes  sec- 
ondary to the arterial  pressure  variations  associated  with the cardiac  cy- 
cle ( Alperin  et al., 1996 ; Balédent  et al., 2004 ; Martin et al., 2012 ). More 
recently,  the importance  of the respiratory  cycle on CSF ﬂow has been 
increasingly  recognized  ( Yamada  et al., 2013 ; Chen et al., 2015 ; Dreha- 
Kulaczewski  et al., 2015 ; Yildiz et al., 2017 ; Takizawa  et al., 2017 ; 
Dreha-Kulaczewski  et al., 2017 ; Spijkerman  et al., 2019 ). Thoracic  pres- 
sure variations  associated  with respiration  are thought  to cause venous 
blood pressure  changes,  which like the cardiac  pulsations  are followed  
by total CBV and then CSF volume  changes:  inspiration  has been found 
to lead to an inﬂux of CSF into the cranium  (cranial  ﬂow) and expira- 
tion to an outﬂow  (caudal  ﬂow) ( Yamada  et al., 2013 ; Chen et al., 2015 ; 
Yildiz et al., 2017 ; Spijkerman  et al., 2019 ). Since both cardiac-  and 
respiratory-cycle  mediated  CSF pulsations  originate  from phasic blood 
pressure  changes  extrinsic  to the cranium,  we refer to them as barogenic  
pulsations.  
Recent reports suggest  that, in addition  to these barogenic  pulsa- 
tions, other mechanisms  may contribute  to pulsatile  CSF ﬂow as well, 
speciﬁcally  conditions  that alter CBV by an active vascular  response  
associated  with electrocortical  or sympathetic  activity,  or blood gas 
changes  ( Fultz et al., 2019 ; van Veluw et al., 2020 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; 
Picchioni  et al., 2022 ). Since the episodic  CBV changes  are eﬀectuated  
through  action of cerebrovascular  smooth  muscle cells, we refer to these 
eﬀects as “cerebrovascular  activity  ”in general,  and the associated  CSF 
ﬂow as myoactive  pulsations.  BOLD fMRI studies have demonstrated  a 
tight relationship  between  widespread  fMRI signal decreases  and mo- 
mentary  CSF inﬂow to the brain via the fourth ventricle  ( Fultz et al., 
2019 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; Picchioni  et al., 2022 ). As with the barogenic  
pulsations,  the myoactive  CSF ﬂow generated  by intrinsic  CBV changes  
can be explained  by the Monro-Kellie  doctrine  of constant  intracranial  
volume  ( Mokri, 2001 ): the myoactive  CBV changes  underlying  the BOLD 
fMRI signal require  compensatory  intracranial  CSF volume  changes.  
Therefore,  one expects  a widespread  in-/decrease  in fMRI signal (and 
thus CBV) to be accompanied  by an out-/inﬂow  of CSF into the cra- 
nium, and movement  of intracranial  CSF. 
As of yet, it remains  unclear  what the relative  contribution  of this 
myoactive  eﬀect is on overall CSF movement.  While previous  reports 
( Fultz et al., 2019 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; Picchioni  et al., 2022 ) suggest  that 
it may be large, quantitative  assessment  has not been performed  due 
to the lack of a fast and robust CSF ﬂow imaging  technique  capable  of 
separating  the diﬀerent  driving  mechanisms  of CSF movement.  Existing  
MRI methods  for the measurement  of CSF ﬂow include  phase-contrast  
( Feinberg  and Mark, 1987 ; Chen et al., 2015 ; Yildiz et al., 2017 ), in- 
version  spin labeling  ( Yamada  et al., 2013 ) and inﬂow-sensitized  MRI 
( Dreha-Kulaczewski  et al., 2015 ). Phase-contrast  MRI (PC-MRI)  has the 
advantage  of whole brain coverage  but has rather limited sensitivity  to 
low ﬂow velocities.  Its application  to CSF imaging  requires  a low ve- 
locity encoding  value (VENC)  of a few cm/s, leading  to much longer 
ﬂow encoding  gradients  and steeper  gradient  switching  than in cardiac  
applications.  Quantiﬁcation  of low-frequency  CSF ﬂow using real-time  
PC-MRI  is also prone to confounding  eﬀects from spatial and tempo- 
ral B 0 ﬁeld changes  ( Peters et al., 2019 ). Inversion  spin labeling  and 
inﬂow-sensitized  MRI have good sensitivity  to low ﬂow velocities  but 
are lacking  in the ability to provide  accurate  quantitative  estimates.  
Proper separation  of diﬀerent  ﬂow components  requires  a measure-  
ment method  that covers the vastly diﬀerent  time scales at which the 
physiological  mechanisms  operate,  ranging  from fractions  of a second 
to tens of seconds.  To address  this, we developed  a previously  reported  
qualitative  MRI method  based on balanced  steady-state  free precession  ( Oshio et al., 2019 ) into a quantitative  approach  to resolve the full range 
of time scales of CSF movement.  We then studied  human subjects  tak- 
ing isolated  volitional  deep inspirations,  an eﬀective  way to generate  
myoaction  through  the eﬀects of local CO 2 changes  and sympathetic  
activation.  The resulting  myoactive  CSF pulsations  were then jointly 
quantiﬁed  with common  barogenic  pulsations  associated  with cardiac  
and respiratory  cycles, including  ﬂow velocities  and displaced  volume.  
The results indicate  exceedingly  large myoactive  CSF displacement  fol- 
lowing deep inspirations,  suggesting  a major contribution  of cerebrovas-  
cular activity  to CSF dynamics.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Overview  
Balanced  steady-state  free precession  (SSFP, also known as True 
FISP/FIESTA)  is a widely used MRI sequence  especially  in cardiac  
MRI, featured  by its zero net (hence “balanced  ”) magnetic  gradient  
moment  within each TR ( Carr, 1958 ; Scheﬄer  and Lehnhardt,  2003 ). 
SSFP typically  has a very short TR of a few ms (well below tissue 
T 2 ) and TE = TR/2, which in combination  with the balanced  gradients,  
make SSFP signal a superposition  of a complex  mix of signal gener- 
ation pathways  ( Scheﬄer  and Hennig,  2003 ; Weigel,  2015 ). The sig- 
nal amplitude  is frequency  dependent  with a repeating  spectral  pat- 
tern 1/TR (in Hz) wide, each pattern  alternating  between  “pass-band  ”
and “transition-band  ”: When a moderate  to large ﬂip angle (e.g. 45°) 
is used, SSFP manifests  a unique T 2 /T 1 contrast  and insensitivity  to 
frequency  across the pass-band;  Within the transition  band, the sig- 
nal amplitude  rapidly  drops to zero. The transition  band is typically  
avoided  in SSFP applications  due to lack of tissue contrast,  except for 
a few niche applications  taking advantage  of its strong frequency  sen- 
sitivity ( Scheﬄer  et al., 2001 ; Miller, 2012 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). The 
alternating  pattern  of pass-bands  and transition-bands  can be observed  
in MRI by applying  a small magnetic  ﬁeld gradient  during SSFP imag- 
ing ( Fig. 1 A ), essentially  introducing  a linear frequency  oﬀset along the 
applied  gradient  ( Haacke  et al., 1990 ; Scheﬄer  et al., 2001 ; Markl and 
Pelc, 2004 ). Based on this imaging  principle,  Oshio et al. reported  that 
with a suﬃciently  high temporal  resolution,  CSF movement  with car- 
diac cycles can be qualitatively  visualized  near the dark transition-bands  
( Oshio et al., 2019 ). In this application,  SSFP in combination  with the 
background  gradient  oﬀset is essentially  a tagging  method  for motion 
detection  ( Axel and Dougherty,  1989 ; Yamada  et al., 2008 ). 
We applied  this method  to a group of healthy  volunteers  in a supine 
resting state and also when they performed  cued deep breaths  to ob- 
serve changes  in CSF ﬂow. In our case, the background  magnetic  ﬁeld 
gradient  was set to ∼0.3 mT/m for qualitative  observation,  leading  to 
equidistant  tags separated  by ∼15 mm. The SSFP images were acquired  
at 246 ms/frame,  suﬃciently  fast to sample the cardiac  pulsations  and 
other slower ﬂow mechanisms  ( Supplementary  Video ). During normal  
respiration,  periodic  tag displacement  and deformation  (and by infer- 
ence CSF ﬂow) can be observed  in the CSF spaces around the brainstem  
and spinal cord at both the cardiac  and respiratory  frequencies  ( Fig. 1 B ). 
During periodic  deep inspirations,  tag changes  increased  ( Fig. 1 C ). 
These observations  are consistent  with previous  reports on CSF ﬂow in- 
duced by arterial  and venous blood pressure  changes  with cardiac  and 
respiratory  cycles ( Dreha-Kulaczewski  et al., 2015 ; Yildiz et al., 2017 ; 
Aktas et al., 2019 ). Importantly,  in addition  to these immediate  baro- 
genic eﬀects, a delayed  myoactive  eﬀect was also observed  that evolved  
over a much longer time scale. Speciﬁcally,  deep inspirations  were fol- 
lowed by extended  periods  of upwards  tag displacement,  indicative  of 
cranial CSF ﬂow surges, with their delay and duration  consistent  with a 
myoactive  mechanism  ( Picchioni  et al., 2022 ). 
Having  identiﬁed  this novel, myoactive  type of CSF pulsations  in the 
SSFP data, we set out to determine  its strength  relative  to barogenic  pul- 
sations.  This required  translating  the observed  changes  in the SSFP tags 
into ﬂow velocities.  Because  of the complex  relationship  between  tag

changes  and temporal  ﬂow proﬁle,  including  diﬀerential  sensitivities  for 
rapidly  (i.e. cardiac  modulated)  and slowly (i.e. respiratory  modulated  
and myoactive)  changing  ﬂow, we opted to use a lookup table ( “ﬂow dic- 
tionary  ”) for this purpose.  To this end, we generated  a two-dimensional  
ﬂow dictionary  based on the simulated,  combined  eﬀects of both rapid 
(with a sinusoidal  velocity  change associated  with the cardiac  cycle), 
and slow (slower  processes  assumed  constant  over the cardiac  cycle) 
changes  in ﬂow on SSFP tags ( Fig. 2 ). The rapid and slow changes  are 
called “HF ﬂow ”a n d “LF ﬂow ” respectively,  for “high-frequency  ”a n d 
“low-frequency  ” components.  Phase shifts of the ﬂow relative  to the 
cardiac  cycle and changes  in cardiac  frequency  were accommodated  by 
generating  additional  dictionary  entries ( Fig. 2 C ). These dictionary  en- 
tries were then matched  through  correlation  to measured  tags for each 
cardiac  cycle, which are small data patches  with dimensions  of cross- 
tag spatial proﬁle by time (11 pixels by 1 cardiac  cycle). The latter are 
referred  to as “perturbation  patterns  ”. 
We performed  ﬂow quantiﬁcation  at the fourth ventricle  and near 
the foramen  of Magendie,  two lower brain positions  with minimal  spa- 
tial variation  of B 0 ﬁeld, despite the capability  of perturbation  patterns  
to qualitatively  capture  CSF dynamics  at multiple  locations  in the lower 
brain and the neck ( Fig. 1 ). This is because  the spatially  cyclic B 0 vari- 
ation originating  from cervical  vertebrae  was comparable  ( ∼60 Hz over 20 mm) to the background  gradient  oﬀset at 3 T, leading  to warping  of 
the perturbation  patterns  ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). Without  subject-  
speciﬁc  B 0 correction  of the images or dictionary,  this might bias the 
ﬂow quantiﬁcation  results.  
2.2. Dictionary  generation  
Bloch simulations  were performed  to create dictionary  entries for 
SSFP perturbation  patterns.  Magnetizations  (isochromats)  along the z 
direction  were modeled  as vectors  ⇀
𝑀 = [ 𝑀 𝑥 , 𝑀 𝑦 , 𝑀 𝑧 ] 𝑇 , and their tem- 
poral evolutions  were calculated  by applying  rotation  and relaxation  
matrices  that account  for RF excitation,  oﬀ-resonance  eﬀects and relax- 
ation eﬀects (Brown  et al., 2014). The spatial and temporal  discretiza-  
tion steps of the Bloch simulations  were 0.15 mm and 1 ms, respectively.  
The CSF velocity  was assumed  to be pseudo-periodic  with a function  of 
𝑣 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐻𝐹 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 2 𝜋
𝑇 𝑡 ) + 𝐿𝐹 , with a constant  𝑇 of 1 s close to the normal  
cardiac  period. The same parameters  in the MRI experiments  were used 
in the Bloch simulations,  namely  TR 6 ms, TE 3 ms, ﬂip angle 45°. T 1 
and T 2 values of CSF were assumed  to be 4 s ( Rooney  et al., 2007 ) and 
2 s ( Qin, 2011 ), respectively.  A background  gradient  along the ﬂow di- 
rection was applied,  leading  to equidistant  tags separated  by 23 mm. 
HF (cardiac)  peaks were assumed  to range from 0 to 12 mm/s (step

simulation  was considered  to have converged  when the change in ﬂow 
pattern  (magnitude  of transverse  magnetization  |𝑀 𝑥 + 𝑖𝑀 𝑦 |versus time 
in a cardiac  cycle) was below 0.5% in the sense of Euclidean  distance,  
i.e. second norm of the diﬀerence.  
For each converged  pattern  ( Fig. 2 B ), 8 equidistant  phase shifts 
across the cardiac  cycle 𝑇 were taken to generate  additional  dictionary  
entries.  The results were downsampled  to 3, 4, and 5 time points to 
match cardiac  periods  of around 750, 1000 and 1250 ms, and down- 
sampled  in space to match the image resolution  of 1.3 mm ( Fig. 2 C ).

2.1. Experimental  paradigm  
2.1.1. Task layout 
We designed  a multi-step  decision  making  task ( Tartaglia  et al., 
2017 ) situated  in a state-space  with 7 circularly  arranged  fractal im- 
ages (states),  with 2 possible  actions at each state (apart from the goal 
which is a terminal  state) ( Fig. 1 B). At the beginning  of each episode,  
participants  were shown an initial state, randomly  chosen among two 
possible  initial states. As soon as a participant  chose an action, there 
was a random  time interval  of 2 to 7 seconds,  after which a diﬀerent  
image was shown ( Fig. 1 C). Participants  continued  to choose actions 
until they reached  the goal, which completes  an episode  ( Fig. 1 B and 
Fig. 1 C). They were instructed  that their task was to reach the goal in 
the smallest  number  of actions.  The image of the goal state was visually  
distinguishable  from all other states and known to participants  before- 
hand. State transitions  were deterministic,  with occasional  “surprise  tri- 
2  V. Liakoni, M.P. Lehmann,  A. Modirshanechi  et al. NeuroImage  246 (2022) 118780 
als ”, explained  further below (sub section 2.1.2 ). In what follows,  we use 
the terms “state transition  ”and “trial ”interchangeably.  
From each state, the two actions led to new states at diﬀerent  dis- 
tances from the goal. The “correct  action ”i s deﬁned  as the one that 
brings the participant  closer (in terms of number  of actions)  to the goal 
state. Since two actions (leading  to two diﬀerent  target states 𝑠 ′) can be 
taken in each state 𝑠 , we characterize  a state 𝑠 by the “distance  from 
goal ”of its two possible  target states 𝑠 ′. For example,  from the state 𝑠 3 
of Fig. 1 B the correct action (green arrow) leads to the goal (0 actions 
from goal), whereas  the other action (red arrow) leads to state 𝑠 6 located  
3 actions away from the goal. We therefore  denote state 𝑠 3 as “0-or-3  ”. 
States that have equal minimum  distance  from goal may diﬀer in the 
resulting  distance  from goal when the “wrong  ”action  is chosen,  or, in 
other words, in their “diﬀerence  in correctness  ”between  the two avail- 
able actions.  For example,  for two states “0-or-3  ”and “0-or-1  ”choosing  
the correct action brings participants  to the goal, but choosing  the wrong 
one is more detrimental  for the “0-or-3  ”state. 
The state images and their locations  on the screen were randomized  
across participants  (for example,  state 𝑠 1 was not physically  next to 𝑠 2 , 
but could be positioned  at any location).  The assignment  of actions to 
left or right button presses were also randomized.  We deﬁned  two dif- 
ferent underlying  transition  matrices  (one of them is depicted  in Fig. 1 B) 
also in a randomized  way across participants.  The distance  of each state 
from goal and the actions’  “correctness  ”for both graphs are provided  in 
the Appendix  (Table A.1). The task was implemented  in Matlab using 
the Psychophysics  Toolbox  ( Brainard,  1997 ). 
2.1.2. Surprise  trials 
During the experiment  we ran in the background  the model-free  (MF) 
SARSA-  𝜆algorithm  ( Sutton and Barto, 1998 ) and the model-based  (MB) 
Forward  Learner  ( Gläscher  et al., 2010 ) with the participant’s  choices  
as inputs. This gave us an online estimate  of the values and the tran- 
sition probabilities  computed  by the two algorithms,  respectively.  The 
SARSA-  𝜆uses the RPE to update approximate  𝑄 -values 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) , i.e. the 
expected  sum of future discounted  rewards  starting  from state 𝑠 and ac- 
tion 𝑎 . The Forward  Learner  updates  the transition  probabilities  via the 
SPE and uses them to directly  compute  the 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) values via the Bellman  
equation.  More details on the algorithms  are provided  in sub section 2.4 
and in the Appendix  subsection  A.8. For the online RPE and SPE com- 
putations,  the choice of the parameters  (e.g. learning  rates 𝛼) was based 
on pilot experiments  performed  prior to this study. 
After participants  had encountered  the goal four times (i.e. com- 
pleted 4 episodes  of the task), we introduced  “surprise  trials ”. On a sur- 
prise trial, participants  transited  to a state 𝑠 ′′other than the one they had 
learned  to expect as the outcome  of action 𝑎 from state 𝑠 ( Fig. 1 D). We 
employed  two types of surprise  trials: (i) purely random  transitions,  and 
(ii) transitions  that met a threshold  criterion  on 𝑉 -values.  For the latter, 
if a participant  expected  to transit from 𝑠 to 𝑠 ′, the other state 𝑠 ′′was 
chosen such that 𝑠 ′and 𝑠 ′′had similar 𝑉 -values according  to the MF 
SARSA-  𝜆, i.e. ||𝑉 ( 𝑠 ′) − 𝑉 ( 𝑠 ′′) ||≤ Δ𝑉 where 𝑉 ( 𝑠 ) = max 𝑎 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) and Δ𝑉 
was a small threshold.  This manipulation  does not aﬀect the MF sys- 
tem, since the experienced  RPE stays the same. For learned  transitions,  
in particular,  the RPE will take low values. At the same time, the ex- 
perienced  MB SPE will be high, since the learned  transition  has been 
violated  ( Fig. 1 D). 
In more detail, after each action taken by a participant,  from a state 
𝑠 to (an expected  state) 𝑠 ′, we checked  whether  the following  conditions  
were fulﬁlled:  (i) the transition  from 𝑠 to 𝑠 ′has been learned  according  to 
what has been previously  experienced  by the Forward  Learner  running  
in the background,  (ii) there is a state 𝑠 ′′that meets the aforementioned  
𝑉 -value threshold  criterion,  according  to the SARSA-  𝜆running  in the 
background,  and (iii) more than 3 trials have occurred  since the last 
surprise  trial. If these conditions  were fulﬁlled,  the participant  transited  
to 𝑠 ′′, and this constituted  a surprise  trial/surprising  transition.  More- 
over, if during 8 consecutive  trials no surprise  trial had occurred,  i.e. 
the above conditions  were not fulﬁlled,  a randomly  chosen unexpected  transition  was enforced  in order to ensure some variability  –excluding  
the goal state and the current  state from possible  landing  states. 
Without  unexpected  transitions,  the SPE would quickly  decrease  to 
low or zero values in a deterministic  graph after experience,  and unex- 
pected transitions  without  the 𝑉 -value criterion  explained  above would 
lead to a high SPE as well as a high RPE, resulting  in a high correla-  
tion between  these two signals.  Our novel experimental  manipulation  
with online monitoring,  however,  enables  us to increase  the variability  
of the SPE signal and to decorrelate  the RPE from the SPE at the same 
time. In order to prevent  participants  from resetting  their estimations  
and starting  learning  from scratch after an unexpected  transition,  i.e. 
prevent  them changing  their policy, we informed  participants  that the 
task graph does not change during the experiment  and the surprise  tri- 
als are outliers.  We note that our task design was based on previous  
literature  ( Daw et al., 2011; Doll et al., 2015a; Economides  et al., 2015; 
Gläscher  et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2013a ) and thus on the 
assumption  that SARSA and Forward  Learner  are likely the correct un- 
derlying  algorithms  (see Appendix  subsection  A.5 for more details and 
for the case that this assumption  is violated).

when human subjects  consciously  detect novel but task irrelevant  stim- 
uli. In contrast,  the P3b event is observed  at a later latency  ( > 300 ms) in 
centro-parietal  electrodes  when task-relevant  novel stimuli are reacted  
to or reported.  
Two other potential  markers  of conscious  auditory  novelty  detec- 
tion are the pupil response  and evoked  oscillations  within the theta (4- 
8 Hz) frequency  range. Phasic increases  in pupil size have been associ- 
ated with the detection  of auditory  novelty,  but whether  this response  
reﬂects  conscious  access is contentious.  Some studies have reported  pha- 
sic increases  in pupil size for auditory  stimuli that are consciously  re- 
ported but not for stimuli that escape conscious  detection  ( Bala et al., 
2020 ; Quirins  et al., 2018 ). Others have shown that during passive  lis- 
tening conditions,  only salient changes  in the auditory  scene elicit a 
pupil response.  In contrast,  when behaviorally  relevant,  any novel stim- 
ulus elicits a pupillary  response  ( Liao et al., 2016 ; Zhao et al., 2019 ). 
This suggests  that the pupil is highly sensitive  to the behavioral  de- 
mands imposed  by the task at hand, and casts doubts on the idea that 
the pupil is a reliable  window  to the contents  of consciousness.  Addi- 
tionally,  previous  magnetoencephalography  (MEG) and EEG studies on 
auditory  mismatch  detection  have reported  increases  in the power of 
theta, alpha and beta oscillations  concomitant  with the MMN and the 
P3 at the scalp level, and in source-reconstructed  prefrontal,  parietal  and 
temporal  regions  ( El Karoui et al., 2015 ; Hsiao et al., 2009 ; Javitt et al., 
2018 ; Recasens  et al., 2018 ; Solís-Vivanco  et al., 2021 ). Among  these os- 
cillatory  responses,  theta-band  activity  has been consistently  associated  
with conscious  perception  of sensory  events and could potentially  serve 
as a marker  of conscious  access to sensory  novelty  ( Haque et al., 2020 ; 
Klimesch  et al., 2001 ; Slagter et al., 2009 ). However,  none of the previ- 
ous studies on auditory  regularity  violations  explicitly  investigated  how 
conscious  access impacts  the oscillatory  dynamics  in response  to novel 
auditory  events. 
Here, we investigated  how conscious  access modulates  the neural 
responses  to sensory  novelty  in the auditory  modality.  We identiﬁed  in- 
dividual  thresholds  for conscious  discrimination  and presented  to our 
participants  sequences  of standard  tones of variable  length. Participants  
were asked to decide whether  the last stimulus  was the same or dif- 
ferent from previous  stimuli in the sequence.  The last stimulus  could 
be another  standard  tone (tgtSTD),  a subthreshold  deviant  target (sub- 
DEV), or a suprathreshold  deviant  target (supraDEV).  We resorted  to 
Signal Detection  Theory (SDT) to study stimulus  detectability  and re- 
sponse systematicity  to the diﬀerent  types of targets.  We then aimed to 
replicate  well-established  ﬁndings  in ERP literature  showing  how the 
MMN and P3 are reliable  markers  of conscious  access to sensory  nov- 
elty. Next, we investigated  how evoked  pupil responses  and changes  in 
theta power are modulated  by conscious  access to auditory  novelty.  Fi- 
nally, we examined  which of these behavioral,  electrophysiological  and 
pupillometric  responses  best predicted  whether  novel auditory  stimuli 
would be consciously  accessed.

Labeled arrows indicate  directions  of increasing  numbers  of parameters  and 
greater tractability.  Models that tend to be too simple to achieve their aims 
would lie at lower right, while ones that are over-complicated  relative to their 
aims would tend to be at upper left. Note that there is considerable  spread 
around the diagonal,  as indicated  by the nonzero  size of the boxes. 
2. Model selection  (Rules 1 –3 ) 
Before starting  to build or select a model it is essential  to have a clear 
idea of what level of theory-experiment  links are feasible  using current  
or reasonably  anticipated  data. Data of the desired  type may not yet be 
available,  but one of the beauties  of modeling  is that it can suggest  which 
types of data will be most beneﬁcial  for determining  the mechanisms  
of speciﬁc  phenomena,  thereby  stimulating  new experiments.  A related 
point is that it is necessary  to model the physical  measurement  processes  
that link system variables  to the quantities  that are ultimately  recorded  
by experimenters.  
This section deals with the determination  of a modeling  level that is 
compatible  with the scientiﬁc  aims, and selection  of its components  and 
parameters  in a mutually  consistent  way that is compatible  with nature 
and computational  constraints.  
2.1. Rule 1: Decide the type and level of model 
Every model is built from components  —e.g.,  if modeling  neurons,  
these might include  the number  of diﬀerent  types of ion channels  and the 
numbers  of compartments  (i.e., sections,  each described  by its own set 
of equations)  into which each neuron is divided  ( Almog and Korngreen,  
2016; Gerstner  and Kistler, 2002 ). Before selecting  model components,  
it is necessary  to have a clear idea of the aims of the model. For exam- 
ple, does it only attempt  to describe  the statistics  of system variables  
without  regard to mechanisms,  or perhaps  to achieve  a phenomenolog-  
ical classiﬁcation  into healthy  and disordered  cases, for example?  Al- 
ternatively,  by addressing  the actual physical  system (the focus of these 
rules), does it aim to establish  just the in-principle  possibility  of model- 
ing a phenomenon;  to show that a particular  approach  is plausible;  to 
obtain qualitatively  correct results;  or to quantitatively  reproduce  and 
predict experimental  data? Figure 1 shows the spectrum  of modeling  aims on the horizontal  
axis, with the typically  required  model style shown on the vertical  axis, 
ranging  from toy models that have only the crudest  representation  of 
the system and few parameters  up to detailed  physically  realistic  mod- 
els with many parameters.  A typical historic  progression  is from lower 
left toward upper right, but the arrows indicate  that this implies  a need 
for more detailed  model components  (e.g., a variety of ion channels  in 
the example  in the previous  paragraph),  correspondingly  more param- 
eters, and better data; simultaneously,  tractability  of solving  the model 
decreases,  so more sophisticated  analytic  methods  and greater computa-  
tional power are required.  A model well below the main diagonal  would 
tend to be inadequate  to achieve  its aims, while one well above the di- 
agonal would tend to be over-complicated  relative  to those aims (or the 
aims could be made more ambitious).  Having  said this, sometimes  new 
insights  enable a simpler  model to achieve  more than a complex  one. 
For example,  the Epileptor  model exploits  the universal  nature of certain 
nonlinear  behaviors  to set aside many details of underlying  mechanisms  
to obtain insight into epileptic  seizure dynamics  —a signiﬁcant  advance  
for clinical  use, although  it necessarily  postpones  the question  of exactly 
which detailed  mechanisms  are in operation  ( Jirsa et al., 2014 ). 
2.2. Rule 2: Decide the model components  
Having  decided  on the aims of your modeling  project,  you next need 
to construct  the model or to select a model developed  by others. Us- 
ing a prior model, if valid, is to be preferred  to designing  a completely  
new one because  a good model should ideally be able to explain  mul- 
tiple phenomena,  and the more situations  it is tested in the more thor- 
oughly validated  it becomes.  Indeed,  the notion of having a new model 
for each new phenomenon  is contrary  to the central aim of scientiﬁc  the- 
ory, stressed  at least since Occam seven centuries  ago, which is to unify 
many phenomenon  within a single framework.  However,  this does not 
imply that an inadequate  or unphysical  existing  model should continue  
to be used —model  falsiﬁcation  is a key part of science.  
When selecting  model features,  it is helpful to have seen prior models 
of many diﬀerent  systems,  biological  and otherwise,  to gain experience  
in the possibilities  for model construction  and perhaps  to adapt models 
from other ﬁelds. Numerous  excellent  books on modeling  and underly-  
ing mathematical  methods  exist, including  ( Courant  and Hilbert,  2004; 
Dayan and Abbott,  2001; Gardiner,  2004; Gerstner  and Kistler, 2002; 
Keener and Sneyd, 2004; Morse and Feshbach,  1953; Murray,  2002; 
Press et al., 1992 ). 
When constructing  or selecting  a model, its components  can not be 
chosen arbitrarily  from the space of possible  ingredients.  Selection  of 
model components  is not a buﬀet or smorgasbord,  in which any combi- 
nation of ingredients  is allowed  and valid. For example,  when modeling  
cortical  neural activity,  if one decides  by ﬁat (i.e., without  explicit  jus- 
tiﬁcation)  to divide the cortex into a coarse network  of discrete  chunks,  
connected  with an imposed  hierarchical  topology,  each chunk having 
one’s favorite  nonlinear-oscillator  dynamics,  it is doubtful  whether  the 
results will have a close connection  to the real brain. There is also the 
danger that desired  outcomes  have simply been incorporated  by hand 
into the model at the outset. 
Just as in cooking,  some model ingredients  are mutually  incompati-  
ble or do not ﬁt with the “meal ”being prepared.  Every component  must 
obey all relevant  physical  laws and be compatible  with the character-  
istics of the system being modeled  —one can simplify  the system,  but 
not contradict  it or laws of nature. Moreover,  the components  must be 
mutually  compatible  to enable consistent  interpretation.  Thus, for ex- 
ample, it is possible  to approximate  a continuous  system by discretizing  
it ﬁnely into a nonuniform  grid, but one can not treat the system as 
being truly discrete.  This mistake  is sometimes  made in analyzing  brain 
connectivity  by performing  statistics  or graph-theoretic  operations  on 
thresholded  and binarized  connections  between  artiﬁcially  discretized  
regions  —for example,  one can not simply count such macroscopic  grid 
connections  at each node as if they were truly discrete.  Similarly,  the

Fig. 2. Constraints  on model components.  Schematic  of how model aims can 
combine  with physical  constraints  and mutual consistency  to greatly reduce the 
combinations  of components  that need be considered.  The dark region involves  
realistic model components  of appropriate  complexity  for the intended  applica-  
tions. 
discrete  grid or network  of measurement  locations  —e.g., electrodes  or 
voxels —must  not be mistaken  for a discrete  structure  in the brain being 
measured.  Quantum  physics  demonstrates  that discrete  and continuous  
systems  can have completely  diﬀerent  behaviors  —all of modern  elec- 
tronics rests on this fact —s o this is not a trivial point. Finally,  while 
backward  compatibility  with prior work can be useful, “everybody  does 
it ”is at best a weak reason for selecting  a particular  model and can never 
justify one that contradicts  physical  laws, known system characteristics,  
or itself. 
One’s aims constrain  the kinds of model components  that are neces- 
sary (see Rule 1) — e.g.,  is it suﬃcient  to compute  average  quantities  
via a few diﬀerential  equations,  or do the dynamics  of thousands  of indi- 
vidual neurons,  synapses,  or molecules  need to be simulated?  Such con- 
siderations  often tie closely to whether  microscopic  or macroscopic  ap- 
proaches  are necessary.  In general,  one should minimize  the number  of 
components,  subject to the aims, with each being justiﬁed  and checked  
for consistency  with the physical  system and for mutual compatibility;  
otherwise  a model can easily degenerate  into a disparate  collection  of 
parts that are cobbled  unconvincingly  together.  A systematic  approach  
will also help to avoid overparametrization  and explicitly  building  into 
the model the eﬀects you are aiming to get out of it. Another  common  
pitfall is to include  “false detail ”in the form of parameters  for features  
(e.g., individual  properties  of every cell in the brain) that can not all be 
individually  measured  and are not relevant  to the level of modeling  in 
question.  
Figure 2 shows schematically  that restriction  to sets of components  
of appropriate  complexity  (vertical  axis) and that are physical  and ob- 
servable  (horizontal  axis) focuses  attention  on a small part of the space 
of possible  models (dark shaded region).  Far from being a crimp on cre- 
ativity, this approach  is a powerful  sieve to eliminate  dead ends and 
focus eﬀort on approaches  that are better justiﬁed  and more likely to 
yield outcomes  that are directly  applicable  to the brain. Models  outside  
this subspace  can sometimes  later lead to advances  within it (e.g., ab- 
stract dynamical  systems  theory led to the Epileptor  model mentioned  
above Jirsa et al., 2014 ), even though their structure  and parameters  
are initially  unrealistic.  But, to avoid overstating  one’s conclusions,  lim- itations  of abstract  models must be acknowledged  when discussing  the 
signiﬁcance  of their results.

5. Implementing  a SS-EP study 
5.1. Study design 
5.1.1. Direct or indirect paradigm?  
As illustrated  in the previous  literature  overview,  there are two disso- 
ciable experimental  approaches  to investigate  a given cognitive  process  
using SS-EPs.  
In a ﬁrst approach,  the experimental  paradigm  is designed  to peri- 
odically  trigger the cognitive  or sensory  process  of interest  at a ﬁxed 
frequency  throughout  the stimulation.  Importantly,  the paradigm  must 
ensure that the process  of interest  can be isolated  from lower-lever  pro- 
cesses. For example,  in Buiatti et al. (2019) a schematic  facelike  pat- 
tern is periodically  presented  to newborns,  triggering  facelike  pattern  
detection  processes  at every cycle of the stimulation.  In this study, a 
non-facelike  pattern  control condition  is used to isolate the cognitive  
process  of interest.  Another  prime example  of direct paradigms  is the 
fast-periodic  oddball  paradigm  (e.g. ( de Heering  and Rossion,  2015 ) de- 
scribed  in section 3.1 ) in which the stimulation  stream is built hierarchi-  
cally, with infrequent  stimuli embedded  at a slow frequency  rate, within 
a faster periodic  stream of stimuli.  This dual frequency  design allows for 
dissociating  the rate of the slow categorization  response  from that of the 
faster local low-level  changes  within a single stimulation  stream.  Note 
that the stimulation  frequency(ies)  used in direct paradigms  must be 
carefully  selected,  in order to ensure that the brain network  supporting  
the process  of interest  can sustain the driving  rhythm  (e.g., the 3-15 Hz 
frequencies  used with EEG must be lowered  to 0.1-0.5 Hz with fMRI; 
Gao et al. 2018 ). 
The second indirect  approach  consists  in tagging  low-level  sen- 
sory features  (e.g., contrast)  while participants  are engaged  in a (non- 
rhythmic)  cognitive  task, and inspecting  how experimental  conditions  
modulate  the low-level  sensory  response.  SS-EP modulations  arise from 
top-down  eﬀects whereby  the cognitive  process  of interest  induces  
changes  in attention,  or cognitive  load. Importantly,  the low-level  fea- tures should remain as similar as possible  across experimental  condi- 
tions. For example,  in Kabdebon  and Dehaene-Lambertz  (2019) , the 
background  of a target image was ﬂickered  at a ﬁxed rate, and the au- 
thors reported  enhanced  SS-EPs when the image was expected.  The dis- 
tinction  between  these two types of experimental  paradigms  –direct  and 
indirect  –is crucial for the interpretation  of the results.  
5.1.2. Which stimulation  frequency(ies)?  
The choice of the stimulation  frequency(ies)  should factor in (1) the 
properties  of the targeted  neural response,  (2) the properties  of the en- 
dogenous  background  physiological  noise, and (3) some practical  con- 
straints.  
The stimulation  frequency(ies)  should match the temporal  dynam-  
ics of the targeted  neural system(s):  sensory  responses  typically  have 
short latencies  and can be tagged at relatively  fast frequencies,  but as 
brain responses  move up the cortical  hierarchy,  their latency  typically  
increases  such that integrated  cognitive  responses  are usually  tagged 
at lower frequencies.  In other words, there is a ‘sweet spot’ in the fre- 
quency  domain  where stimulation  will elicit robust SS-EPs,  and ‘blind 
spots’ where the stimulation  will not elicit any sustained  response.  Crit- 
ically, these limitations  depend  upon the neurophysiological  properties  
of the underlying  neural system,  which varies with age. The frequen-  
cies yielding  robust responses  with adults may thus be inappropriate  to 
elicit SS-EP responses  in the infant brain, especially  for higher-level  cog- 
nitive processes.  Ideally,  the frequency  tuning function  of the targeted  
system should be deﬁned  ahead of the experiment  ( Alonso-Prieto  et al., 
2013 ). This, however,  represents  an important  cost, which is not always 
achievable.  
A second factor to consider  when choosing  the stimulation  frequency  
is the background  brain activity.  Indeed,  neural recordings  contain  
a wide range of spontaneous  ﬂuctuations  (termed  background  noise, 
by contrast  to the evoked  signal) which are not distributed  uniformly  
across frequencies.  Instead,  EEG typically  exhibits  an inverse  power law 
(or 1/f) distribution:  in other words, the recordings  are dominated  by 
slow ﬂuctuations,  especially  in young infants ( Eisermann  et al., 2013 ; 
Marshall  et al., 2002 ). Additionally,  some frequency  bands can show 
particularly  strong spontaneous  activity.  This is the case for the classi- 
cal alpha band (9-12Hz  in adult, 6-9Hz in infants ( Marshall  et al., 2002 )) 
over occipital  sites. As a result, unless the aim of the experiment  is to 
interact  with these endogenous  rhythms,  it is typically  recommended,  
whenever  possible,  to avoid these noisy frequency  bands in order to 
maximize  the signal-to  noise-ratio  at the targeted  frequency.  If it cannot 
be avoided,  the signal-to-noise  ratio can be increased  by presenting  a 
longer stream,  with more stimulation  cycles. However,  it is important  
to note that the distribution  of the background  noise level is impacted  
by the mental state of the participant  (e.g., asleep vs awake).  
Finally,  various  practical  aspects  of the experimental  design need 
to be considered.  First, the stimulation  frequency(ies)  must be com- 
patible with the duration  of the trials. A general  rule of thumbs  is to 
ensure that at least two to four stimulation  cycles ﬁt within a stimula-  
tion stream.  The larger the number  of cycles, the more robust the SS-EP 
response,  and the cleaner  the subsequent  analyses.  Another  potential  
limiting  factor is the stimulus  presentation  device. Stimulus  presenta-  
tion is indeed necessarily  synchronized  with the device’s  refresh rate, 
which can severely  restrict the range of possible  stimulation  frequen-  
cies. For example  with a visual ﬂickering  stimulation,  if all stimuli have 
to have a 50/50 on/oﬀ ratio  for the purpose  of the experiment,  then 
frequencies  are limited to even integer divisors  of the monitor’s  refresh 
rate (but see ( Andersen  and Müller,  2015 ) for interpolation  methods).  
Finally,  if the paradigm  involves  multiple  stimulation  frequencies,  one 
should ensure that the successive  frequencies  and their harmonics  can 
be separated  by a minimum  of 4 to 8 frequency  bins during the spec- 
tral analysis.  Failure to do so will allow cross-contamination  and an 
inﬂated  (or deﬂated)  estimate  of the true EEG power at the targeted  
frequency.

ameter ( Liewald  et al., 2014 ), whereas  a typical isotropic  dMRI voxel is 
≳1.5 mm. This means a single voxel can contain  millions  of axons with 
various  orientations  or exhibit partial volume  eﬀects that can confound  
tractography  estimates  ( Alexander  et al., 2001 ). One potential  solution  
to this dilemma  is improved  spatial resolution,  which requires  higher 
signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR). Substantial  SNR gains can be achieved  by 
using higher magnetic  ﬁelds ( Pohmann  et al., 2016 ; Tavaf et al., 2021 ; 
Ugurbil,  2014 , 2014 ; Vaughan  et al., 2001 ), despite the accompanying  
decrease  in T 2 , which is disadvantageous  for diﬀusion  encoding  with 
respect to SNR. Contemporary  techniques,  such as using single echoes 
(rather than two) enabled  by removal  of eddy current  eﬀects through  im- 
age processing  ( Andersson  and Sotiropoulos,  2016 ; Sotiropoulos  et al., 
2013 ), acquiring  highly undersampled  data along the phase encoding  di- 
rection using parallel  imaging  and partial Fourier  ( Vu et al., 2015 ), and 
using high performance  gradients  (Setsompop  et al., 2013; Sotiropoulos  
et al., 2013 ) make it possible  to achieve  suﬃciently  short echo-times  
(TEs) for diﬀusion  encoding  to exploit the intrinsic  SNR gains of high 
magnetic  ﬁelds ( U ǧurbil et al., 2013 ). SNR can be further improved  by 
adding a denoising  step when preprocessing  dMRI data ( Moeller  et al., 
2021 ; Veraart  et al., 2016b ; Veraart  et al., 2016c ). Additional  challenges  
of increased  B0 and B1 inhomogeneity  and increased  tissue energy ab- 
sorption  at the higher magnetic  ﬁelds are also becoming  tractable  using 
new techniques,  in particular  parallel  transmit  coils and parallel  trans- 
mit RF pulse design ( U ğurbil, 2018 ) and optimized  RF pulses ( Wu et al., 
2018 ) As a result, 7 Tesla is increasingly  prevalent  in dMRI applica-  
tions in humans  ( Gulban  et al., 2018 ; Kida et al., 2016 ; Lenglet  et al., 
2012 ; Moeller  et al., 2021 ; Sotiropoulos  et al., 2016 ; Vu et al., 2015 ; 
Wang et al., 2019 ; Zitella et al., 2015 ). 
Higher ﬁeld scanners  have also successfully  been used to conduct  
dMRI studies,  with improved  spatial resolution,  SNR, and/or contrast-  
to-noise  ratio (CNR) in smaller  mammals  and ex vivo tissue ( Sakai et al., 
2020 ; Schaeﬀer  et al., 2017 ). Ex vivo dMRI scans of the human brain can 
be collected  on small-bore,  very high ﬁeld scanners  typically  reserved  
for animal studies.  On such systems,  voxel dimensions  of a few hun- 
dred microns  can be achieved,  although  they suﬀer from reduced  CNR 
because  of the properties  of ﬁxed tissue, often requiring  scan times of 
hours to days ( Bastiani  et al., 2016 ; McNab et al., 2009 ; Roebroeck  et al., 
2019 ; Seehaus  et al., 2015 ). In vivo dMRI scans of small animals,  such 
as mice, have achieved  similarly  impressive  resolutions  ( Alomair  et al., 
2015 ; Yon et al., 2020 ). Indeed,  higher spatial resolution  (0.5 mm vs 
1 mm isotropic)  achieved  by limiting  the diﬀusion  encoding  to low b 
values improves  estimates  of smaller  ﬁbers and reduces  partial volume  
eﬀects, which has been shown to improve  tractography  detection  of U- 
ﬁbers ( Tounekti  et al., 2018 ). Increased  resolution  could also improve  
gray matter applications  of dMRI, such as distinguishing  cortical  re- 
gions and deﬁning  microstructure  ( Ganepola  et al., 2018 ; Truong  et al., 
2014 ). However,  tractography  based on extremely  high resolution  dMRI 
data can still generate  erroneous  pathways,  especially  if the loss of 
SNR that accompanies  higher resolutions  pushes the data to a noise 
dominated,  low SNR regime;  for example,  ex vivo diﬀusion  MRI data 
acquired  at 0.13 mm isotropic  resolution  produced  more erroneous  
streamlines  in multiple  ﬁber pathways  than data acquired  at lower reso- 
lutions ( Calabrese  et al., 2014 ). Clearly,  the optimal  protocol  for collect-  
ing high resolution  data will require  a balance  between  total scan time, 
angular  resolution  and b-values.  Data obtained  with both high and low 
resolutions  can be combined  to exploit advantages  inherent  in the two 
diﬀerent  data sets ( Sotiropoulos  et al., 2016 ). 
The challenges  and beneﬁts  of higher ﬁeld strengths  change accord-  
ing to the species studied,  but the macaque  is a frequently  used neuro- 
biological  model for the human brain because  of its size and the human-  
macaque  cortical  homologies  not present  in rodents  ( Hutchison  and 
Everling,  2012 ; Laubach  et al., 2022 ; Mars et al., 2016 ; Petrides  and 
Pandya,  2002 ; Preuss, 1995 ; Watson  and Platt, 2012 ). Furthermore,  be- 
cause of these similarities,  the macaque  brain is also used to study a 
wide array of mechanisms  that model brain disorders  and treatments  ( Heilbronner  and Chafee,  2019 ; Johnson  et al., 2021 ; Johnson  and 
Slopsema,  2017 ; Nelson and Winslow,  2009 ; Vitek and Johnson,  2019 ; 
Worlein,  2014 ; Xiao et al., 2016 ). Unlike humans,  macaques  can un- 
dergo invasive  procedures,  such as tract-tracing,  optogenetics,  chemo-  
genetics,  and single-unit  recordings  ( Cushnie  et al., 2020 ; De et al., 
2020 ; Galvan et al., 2017 ; Raper et al., 2019 ; Upright  et al., 2018 ; 
Watanabe  et al., 2020 ). There is a wealth of anatomical  tract-tracing  
data available  for the macaque,  including  CoCoMac  and Core-Nets  
( Bakker et al., 2012 ; Markov  et al., 2014 ; Stephan  et al., 2001 ), 
which have been used to validate  and reﬁne diﬀusion  tractography  in 
macaques  ( Azadbakht  et al., 2015 ; Donahue  et al., 2016 ; van den Heuvel 
et al., 2015 ). The combination  of strong homology  to the human brain 
and the ability to employ  invasive  procedures  to modulate  neural activ- 
ity and determine  anatomical  connectivity  means that high-resolution  
in vivo dMRI of the macaque  brain would be invaluable.  
While very high resolution  dMRI has been acquired  with ex vivo scans 
in both humans  and macaques  ( Azadbakht  et al., 2015 ; Calabrese  et al., 
2015 ; Fritz et al., 2019 ; Sébille et al., 2019 ), there are signiﬁcant  bene- 
ﬁts to acquiring  high resolution  scans in vivo. For example,  individual-  
ized surgical  planning  for deep brain stimulation  (DBS) in humans  and 
macaques  can beneﬁt from in vivo dMRI for targeting  ( Davidson  et al., 
2020 ; Hunsche  et al., 2013 ; Patriat et al., 2018 ; Plantinga  et al., 2018 ; 
Johnson  et al., 2016 ). Similarly,  preoperative  dMRI scans can guide in- 
tracranial  electrode  implantation  in macaques  ( Saalmann  et al., 2012 ). 
Other intraoperative  surgeries  in humans  and/or macaques  could bene- 
ﬁt from accurate  dMRI data on white matter organization  and connectiv-  
ity, including  the current  push for adeno-associated  virus-mediated  gene 
therapies  ( Hudry and Vandenberghe,  2019 ; Weiss et al., 2022 ). The use 
of in vivo dMRI also provides  the opportunity  to perform  longitudinal  
studies that monitor  normal  development,  the progress  of various  dis- 
ease states or as a biomarker  for neurodegeneration  ( Andica et al., 2020 ; 
Baldaranov  et al., 2017 ; de Groot et al., 2016 ; Fields, 2008 ; Huber et al., 
2018 ; Krogsrud  et al., 2016 ; Lövdén  et al., 2010 ; Mackey  et al., 2012 ). 
These approaches  are only possible  with the use of in vivo dMRI acqui- 
sitions, which could be improved  with higher resolution  scans. 
Here, we detail our eﬀorts to acquire  high-quality  dMRI at 10.5 Tesla 
in anesthetized  rhesus and long-tailed  macaques.  Macaques  are too large 
for ultrahigh  ﬁeld, small-bore  preclinical  scanners  often used for in vivo 
studies of smaller  model organisms.  The 10.5T/88  cm bore magnet  uti- 
lized in the present  study currently  represents  the highest  ﬁeld, large 
bore scanner  in the world capable  of scanning  macaques  ( Yacoub  et al., 
2022 ) and humans  ( He et al., 2020 ). Our approach  produces,  to our 
knowledge,  the highest  spatial and angular  resolution  in vivo macaque  
dMRI data (0.58 mm isotropic  voxels) to date and is presented  as proof- 
of-concept  for this type of data collection.

eral structures  are conserved  from person to person but whose ﬁne- 
grained  topologies  and strengths  serve as stable identiﬁers  of individ-  
uals ( Finn et al., 2015 ; Gordon  et al., 2017 ). These networks  are classi- 
cally derived  from resting state functional  connectivity  (RSFC),  which is 
deﬁned  as the correlation  between  activity  time courses  from any two 
regions  measured  while the brain is not performing  an explicit  task. A 
growing  literature  has shown that RSFC can be used to predict both 
normal  and pathological  variation  in model-based  measures  of brain ac- 
tivity during challenging  experimental  tasks, providing  compelling  ev- 
idence for the idea that RSFC describes  the routes along which task- 
relevant  information  travels ( Cole et al., 2016 ; Hearne  et al., 2021 ; Ito 
et al., 2017 ; Mill et al., 2020 ; van den Heuvel and HulshoﬀPol,  2010 ). 
However,  the extent to which RSFC can predict individual  diﬀerences  
in model-free  neural responses  to naturalistic  stimuli and shed light 
on how inter-regional  communication  facilitates  localized  processing  of 
such stimuli is still unclear.  
To characterize  how RSFC is associated  with normative  stimulus-  
evoked  activity  during movie watching,  we analyzed  fMRI data acquired  
across multiple  days from healthy  Human  Connectome  Project partici-  
pants. First, we show that RSFC can be used to predict cortex-wide  ISC 
in new subjects  and using data from held-out  stimuli.  Next, we demon-  
strate that the resting state functional  connections  most associated  with 
ISC in a speciﬁc  region vary systematically  across the brain and quantify  
how greater intrinsic  connectivity  to one region is associated  with more 
or less typical activity  in others. Finally,  we show that individual-speciﬁc  
RSFC patterns  are related to the spatial distribution  of ISC across cortex. 
Taken together,  these results provide  important  context  for interpreting  
atypical  responses  to naturalistic  stimuli and detail new relationships  
between  intrinsic  and task-driven  brain function.

tural communities  (deﬁned  in terms of random  walks) to patterns  of 
functional  connectivity,  suggesting  that such communities  model brain 
function.  More recently,  in ( Diez et al., 2015 ), hierarchical  modular  
structure  has been investigated  in group-average  structural  and func- 
tional networks,  ﬁnding  that there exist partitions  that are highly mod- 
ular in both types of connectivity.  In ( Fukushima  et al., 2018 ), the over- 
lap between  structural  and functional  weights  and modules  has been 
investigated  during diﬀerent  states of integration  and segregation  of 
time-varying  functional  networks,  ﬁnding  that structure  and function  
are closer when functional  connectivity  presents  an integrated  network  
topology.  However,  a straightforward  analysis  of the interplay  between  
anatomical  and functional  modules  is missing.  
In parallel,  a growing  number  of studies have begun investigating  
multi-layer  network  models of brains ( De Domenico,  2017; Vaiana and 
Muldoon,  2018 ). The multi-layer  framework  allows for multiple  in- 
stances  or observations  of a networked  system to be analyzed  under 
a single model. In the context  of brain network  analysis,  multi-layer  
network  models can be constructed  to capture  the covariance  structure  
of functional  brain data ( Bassett et al., 2011; Betzel et al., 2017; Braun 
et al., 2015; De Domenico  et al., 2016; Puxeddu  et al., 2020; Shine et al., 
2016 ) or to establish  node correspondence  across networks  representing  
diﬀerent  subjects’  brains ( Betzel et al., 2019 ). 
In this work, we introduce  a novel extension  of the multi-layer  frame- 
work to directly  investigate  the relationship  between  anatomical  and 
functional  modular  organization,  which also accounts  for the multi-scale  
nature of modules  and their subject speciﬁcity.  This approach  is con- 
ceived as an extension  of the well-known,  and widely employed,  multi- 
layer modularity  maximization  model ( Mucha et al., 2010 ). One of the 
greatest  advantage  of this model lies in its ﬂexibility,  and previous  work 
demonstrated  that one can easily modify its skeleton  to address  speciﬁc  
question  of neuroscience  ( Zamani  Esfahlani  et al., 2021 ). Building  on 
these works, we reformulate  the coupling  scheme  of multi-layer  modu- 
larity maximization.  We incorporate  a double inter-layer  resolution  pa- 
rameter,  one regulating  the coupling  between  structural  and functional  
connectivity  matrices,  and the other one regulating  the inter-subject  
coupling.  Thus, we simultaneously  map communities  across subjects  and 
modes of connectivity,  which enables  direct comparison  of multi-modal  
modules  via community  labels. We applied  this model to MRI-derived  
anatomical  and functional  brain networks  of healthy  adults, to investi-  
gate how the modular  structure  of brain networks  varies across subjects  
and connectivity  modality.  We describe  which brain sub-systems  form 
modules  consistent  across modalities  and those that decouple  from one 
another  to form modality  speciﬁc  modules.  In summary,  our work ex- 
tends the multi-layer  modularity  maximization  framework  and paves 
the way for future studies to investigate  structure-function  relationships  
in diﬀerent  contexts.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Experimental  datasets  and data processing  
We leveraged  anatomical  and functional  MRI data belonging  to two 
independently  acquired  datasets  that we describe  below. 
NKI dataset 
First, we considered  data from the Nathan  Kline Institute  Rock- 
land Sample  project ( Nooner  et al., 2012 ) (NKI-RS,  http://fcon_  
1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/  ). Institutional  Review  Board 
approval  was obtained  for this project at the Nathan  Kline Institute  
(#226781  and #239708)  and at Montclair  State University  (#000983  
A and #000983B)  in accordance  with relevant  guidelines.  All par- 
ticipants  gave written  informed  consent  or assent. The anonymized  
dataset is freely available  at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/  
indi/enhanced/neurodata.html  . The NKI dataset consists  of imaging  
data from a community  sample of subjects  across a large portion  of 
the human lifespan.  We focused  our analyses  to subjects  within the age range of 20–40 years old, to concentrate  on structure-function  relation-  
ships without  added inﬂuence  of age-related  changes.  The data process-  
ing resulted  in anatomical  and functional  networks  made of 100 nodes 
from 123 subjects.  
HCP dataset 
We also analyzed  data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Van Essen et al., 2013 ), a consortium  projected  to construct  a map of 
human brain circuits  and their relationship  to behavior  in a large popu- 
lation of healthy  adults. The study was approved  by the Washington  Uni- 
versity Institutional  Review  Board and informed  consent  was obtained  
from all subjects.  It comprises  a large cohort of subjects  ( > 1000), from 
which multiple  imaging  data were acquired  (diﬀusion  MRI, resting-  
fMRI, task-fMRI  and MEG/EEG),  together  with behavioral  and genetic  
data. Details of the image acquisition  and minimal  preprocessing  can be 
found in ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). We focused  only on the 100 unrelated  
subjects.  Of the 100 subjects,  5 have been excluded  after preprocess-  
ing. This resulted  in obtaining  structural  and functional  networks  of 95 
subjects  (56% female,  mean age = 29.29 ±",\n?2\. | \n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(5596, 5599), match='2. '>","<re.Match object; span=(5823, 5826), match=' 3.'>"

1. Introduction  
The Centiloid  (CL) scale was developed  to harmonise  all 𝛽− amyloid  
(A 𝛽) PET tracer quantiﬁcation  into a single universal  scale ( Klunk et al., 
2015 ). In this scale, CL = 0 is anchored  to group average  of young 
healthy  controls,  and CL = 100 to group average  of mild Alzheimer’s  
disease  (AD) patients.  While the Centiloid  scale was originally  only 
calibrated  for 11 C-PiB (PiB), it describes  a framework  where diﬀerent  
tracers and methods  could be calibrated.  The prescribed  quantiﬁcation  
pipeline  based on SPM has since been calibrated  for all F-18 A 𝛽trac- 
ers, namely  18 F-Florebetaben  (FBB) ( Rowe et al., 2017 ), 18 F-NAV4694  
(NAV) ( Rowe et al., 2016 ), 18 F-Flutemetamol  (FLUTE)  ( Battle et al., 
2018 ) and 18 F-Florbetapir  (FBP) ( Navitsky  et al., 2016 ). These data were 
then made publicly  available  1 so that other quantiﬁcation  approaches  
could be calibrated.  This was later performed  using diﬀerent  approaches  
including  a number  of MR-based  methods  such as PMOD ( Battle et al., 
2018 ; Hanseeuw  et al., 2021 ), FSL ( Battle et al., 2018 ), FreeSurfer  
( Royse et al., 2021 ; Su et al., 2018 ), and SPM5 ( Schwarz  et al., 2018 ), 
as well as PET-only  methods  including  CapAIBL  ( Bourgeat  et al., 2018 ). 
We have also seen non-traditional  quantiﬁcation  methods  based on im- 
age decomposition  being also calibrated  into Centiloids  ( Bourgeat  et al., 
2021 ). 
While the Centiloid  scale provides  a good framework  for harmon-  
ising across tracers and processing  pipelines,  there could still be sig- 
niﬁcant  residual  non-biological  variability,  which could be attributable  
to heterogeneity  in data collection,  preprocessing  framework  or prepro-  
cessing steps. Such heterogeneity  could hide subtle longitudinal  changes  
which are important  to improve  our understanding  of the progression  of 
AD and its risk factors.  These could also hamper  the detection  of small 
changes  in anti-A 𝛽therapy  and clinical  trials. It is therefore  important  to 
evaluate  existing  quantiﬁcation  and harmonisation  strategies  in a large 
multi-centre  datasets  to quantify  their impact on longitudinal  variability  
of A 𝛽over time. 
One of the main source of variability  is the use of diﬀerent  PET scan- 
ners and reconstruction  methods,  which is inevitable  in multi-site  stud- 
ies such as AIBL or ADNI. Diﬀerences  in scanner  geometry,  underlying  
technology  and reconstruction  algorithms  can lead to large diﬀerences  
in quantiﬁcation  ( Aide et al., 2017 ; Joshi et al., 2009 ). Early work on 
scanner  harmonisation  was led by the work of Joshi et al. (2009) based 
on the scan of a Hoﬀman  phantom  used to estimate  the amount  of 
smoothing  required  to bring all the data to a uniform  resolution.  This 
method  has been employed  in ADNI as part of their standard  pre- 
processing  pipeline  for all PET images and is often included  in clinical  
studies and trials. While the initial validation  was performed  on FDG, its 
impact on A 𝛽image quantiﬁcation  acquired  on diﬀerent  scanners  has 
not been fully assessed.  
The choice of reference  region can also impact the reliability  of A 𝛽
quantiﬁcation.  While the whole cerebellum  (WCb) is the prescribed  ref- 
erence region as it was shown to lead to the highest  eﬀect size between  
young controls  and mild AD, its stability  over time for each tracer has 
not been fully assessed.  Previous  work using the standardised  uptake 
ratio (SUVR)  has shown that WCb is suboptimal  for FBP in longitu-  
dinal studies ( Landau  et al., 2015 ) and a composite  region of subcor-  
tical white matter plus WCb (WM + WCb) led to improved  longitudi-  
nal consistency  and a rate of increase  more congruous  with quantiﬁca-  
tion obtained  using PiB. While including  WM in the reference  region 
is believed  to improve  quantiﬁcation  by counteracting  the eﬀects of 
the WM spilling  into the cortical  target regions  ( López-González  et al., 
2019 ), there remains  concerns  with including  WM in a reference  due 
its non-speciﬁc  binding  being signiﬁcantly  diﬀerent  from the cortex GM 
( Fodero-Tavoletti  et al., 2009 ) and its lower tracer uptake in regions  of 
WM injuries  ( Pietroboni  et al., 2022 ) and demyelination  ( Moscoso  et al., 
2022 ). This composite  reference  region has been widely used for SUVR 
1 http://www.gaain.org/centiloid-project  . quantiﬁcation,  but has only recently  been cross-sectionally  evaluated  
for Centiloids  ( Royse et al., 2021 ). 
Lastly, novel quantiﬁcation  methods  which do not rely on prede- 
ﬁned regions  of interest  have been proposed.  These methods  use im- 
age decomposition  to separate  speciﬁc  from non-speciﬁc  binding,  as 
part of the A 𝛽quantiﬁcation.  These methods  all show good correla-  
tion with standard  CL or SUVR, while improving  the separation  be- 
tween Healthy  Controls  (HC) and AD patients  ( Pegueroles  et al., 2021 ; 
Whittington  and Gunn, 2019 ), increasing  the correlation  with cogni- 
tive measures  ( Liu et al., 2021 ) and reducing  longitudinal  variabil-  
ity ( Bourgeat  et al., 2021 ; Whittington  and Gunn, 2019 ). These meth- 
ods include  Non-negative  Matrix Factorisation  (NMF) ( Bourgeat  et al., 
2021 ), AmyQ ( Pegueroles  et al., 2021 ) and A 𝛽-index ( Leuzy et al., 2020 ) 
which both rely on a PCA decomposition,  Amyloid  Load (Amyloid  IQ ) 
( Whittington  and Gunn, 2019 ) which uses an image-base  regression,  
and a more recent deep-learning  based method  which learns to separate  
the speciﬁc  from the non-speciﬁc  binding  based on A 𝛽- scans ( Liu et al., 
2021 ). To our knowledge,  our previous  work on NMF was the only ap- 
proach to explicitly  enforce  consistency  between  the decomposition  of 
each tracer, and attempt  to implicitly  reduce the variability  due to the 
use of diﬀerent  scanners.  Moreover,  it was validated  on all ﬁve A 𝛽trac- 
ers currently  in use and assessed  in terms of longitudinal  consistency  in 
the multi-tracer/multi-scanner  AIBL study. The validation  however  did 
not assess the eﬀect of the uniform  resolution,  the importance  of the 
choice in the reference  region or its eﬀectiveness  in other studies.  
Other work on PET harmonisation  includes  a recent deep learning  
approach  ( Shah et al., 2022 ) which allows to transform  an image from 
an Amyloid  tracer (FBP) to another  Amyloid  tracer (PiB). While this 
approach  showed  promising  results,  a major limitation  is the need for 
a large number  of paired scans to train the model ( N = 80 used in the 
paper).  The ComBat  harmonisation  method  which is widely used in MR 
scanner  harmonisation  has also been recently  used for FDG PET SUV 
harmonisation  ( Orlhac et al., 2022 ). However,  to our knowledge,  it has 
not been evaluated  for Amyloid  PET harmonisation.  
In this work, we aim to assess the impact of smoothing  to a uniform  
resolution,  choice of the reference  region and choice of the quantiﬁca-  
tion method  on the harmonization  of the A 𝛽PET data in three large 
longitudinal  cohorts,  namely  AIBL, ADNI and OASIS3  as part of the 
Alzheimer’s  Dementia  Onset and Progression  in International  Cohorts  
(ADOPIC)  study. We ﬁrst evaluate  the impact of smoothing  the PET data 
to a uniform  8mm resolution.  We then look at the stability  of the ref- 
erence region for each tracer and evaluate  the impact of the choice of 
reference  region for FBP. Lastly, we compare  the quantiﬁcation  using 
the standard  SPM8 pipeline  and the more advanced  NMF quantiﬁcation  
approach.  Since not all subjects  can undergo  an MRI, we also evaluated  
the impact of all these harmonisation  strategies  on our PET-only  quan- 
tiﬁcation  method  through  CapAIBL,  and its NMF extension  on the same 
subset of subjects.  We ﬁrst compared  the corresponding  Centiloid  values 
cross-sectionally  to evaluate  their impact on the quantiﬁcation,  before 
evaluating  their consistency  in longitudinal  data. 
2. Methods  
2.1. Data 
Data used in this study combined  three of the largest and publicly  
available  imaging  studies in AD, namely  AIBL ( Ellis et al., 2009 ), ADNI 
( Petersen  et al., 2010 ) and OASIS3  ( LaMontagne  et al., 2019 ). We ex- 
tracted all A 𝛽PET data and corresponding  T1W MRI acquired  before 
the 31st of December  2020 in AIBL (N images = 3315, N subjects = 1345), 
ADNI (N images = 3516, N subjects = 1648) and OASIS3  (N images = 1398, 
N subjects = 748) for a total of 8229 PET scans from 3741 participants.  
AIBL A 𝛽PET scans were acquired  using one of ﬁve tracers (PiB, FBP, 
FBB, NAV, FLUTE),  ADNI used three (PiB, FBP, FBB) and OASIS3  used 
two (PiB, FBP). The breakdown  of the tracer’s  distribution  is given in 
Table 1 , showing  that PIB is the most prevalent  tracer in AIBL and OA-

compared  OLS and the Least Absolute  Shrinkage  and Selection  Operator  
(LASSO)  method  ( Tibshirani,  1996 ), which regularizes  the OLS problem  
with a penalty  based on the L1 norm of the MVAR coeﬃcients  to stabi- 
lize estimation  in low data situations.  These authors  reported  that OLS 
suﬀers relative  to LASSO with fewer than 10 Mp samples.  A subsequent  
study ( Antonacci  et al., 2021 ) compared  OLS to a stochastic  gradient  
descent  version  of LASSO and showed  cases where 20 Mp samples  were 
required  for accurate  estimation  by OLS. 
These rules of thumb for OLS have been obtained  with relatively  
small networks,  typically  M ≤ 10 for simulations  and M ≤ 30 for human 
electrophysiology.  Indeed,  the diﬃculty  of reliably  estimating  MVAR 
model coeﬃcients  from available  data appears  to have limited previ- 
ously reported  applications  in human electrophysiology  to fewer than 
∼30 electrodes  [for example,  see Korzeniewska  et al. (2011) for a rela- 
tively high-dimensional  example;  Brovelli  et al. (2004) use of four and 
six channel  models is more typical].  The primary  contribution  of this 
study is to explore  MVAR model estimation  methods  that enable mod- 
eling of much larger networks  than previously  possible  from practical  
data lengths.  We consider  networks  with M ∼100 - 200 recording  sites. 
In some cases we ﬁnd that ∼100 Mp samples  may be necessary  to obtain 
reliable  results with OLS, further motivating  study of improved  estima-  
tion methods.  
Intracranial  electroencephalography  (iEEG) recordings  from neuro- 
surgical  patients  can simultaneously  sample neural activity  from hun- 
dreds of locations  in the brain with high spatial and temporal  resolu- 
tion, and thus are a rich source of multivariate  data for exploring  causal 
interactions  in brain networks.  However,  exploiting  the opportunity  af- 
forded by MVAR modeling  with hundreds  of electrodes  is challenging  
due to limited data availability.  For example,  with typical iEEG record-  
ing parameters  of M = 200 and sampling  frequency  of 250 Hz, and a 
model order of p = 8, 100 Mp translates  into a required  data length of 
> 10 minutes  for a single static estimate  of connectivity;  dynamic  con- 
nectivity  analysis  ( Preti et al., 2017 ) in this scenario  would be impracti-  
cal. Furthermore,  even when working  with longer duration  recordings,  
factors such as the presence  of artifacts  and nonstationarity  can limit 
the total duration  of data available  for estimating  an accurate  MVAR 
model. These considerations  motivate  the development  of methods  to ﬁt 
MVAR models in the limited data regime.  The standard  workaround  for 
this problem  has been to estimate  MVAR models using smaller  subsets 
of selected  recording  sites. Unfortunately,  this removes  potential  medi- 
ating variables  and connections  and distorts  the true causal network  
underlying  brain activity,  drastically  increasing  the likelihood  of de- 
tecting spurious  eﬀective  connections  ( Granger,  1980 ; Kus et al., 2004 ; 
Olejarczyk  et al., 2017 ). In particular,  multivariate  methods  applied  to 
full datasets  are optimal  for identifying  neural correlates  of behavior  
and arousal  state transitions  ( Kus et al., 2004 ; Olejarczyk  et al., 2017 ) 
There have been several attempts  to implement  dimensionality-  
reduction  techniques  to more accurately  ﬁt MVAR models to large mul- 
tivariate  datasets.  Principal  component  analysis  (PCA) has been used 
previously  to ﬁt MVAR models to scalp electroencephalography  data 
( Joliﬀe and Morgan,  1992 ). In this approach,  PCA is applied  to the 
electrode-by-electrode  covariance  matrix to yield “virtual  scalp elec- 
trodes ”, i.e., electrodes  projected  onto an orthogonalized  basis set that 
more eﬃciently  captures  the spatial variability  across electrodes.  To re- 
tain greater spatial information,  PCA has also been applied  separately  to 
regions  of interest  (ROIs) on the scalp determined  a priori , prior to con- 
catenating  the full set of principal  components  across ROIs as input to 
the MVAR model ( Wang et al., 2016 ). We will refer to this approach  as 
rPCA. Connections  between  ROIs and their virtual electrodes  can then 
be aggregated  and summarized  using “block ” measures  of connectiv-  
ity ( Faes et al., 2012 ; Faes and Nollo, 2013 ). In practice,  a signiﬁcant  
fraction  of the original  dimensions  must be retained  to avoid the bias as- 
sociated  with discarding  weaker  components,  and this limits the degree 
of dimensionality  reduction  that can be achieved  with PCA methods.  
Another  dimensionality  reduction  approach  is to select a subset of 
the available  data values for inclusion  in the MVAR model, which re- duces the number  of MVAR coeﬃcients  that must be estimated.  Partial 
conditioning  ( Marinazzo  et al., 2012 ) uses a greedy algorithm  that se- 
quentially  selects important  variables  to a particular  driver for condi- 
tional Granger  causality  calculations  based on mutual information.  An- 
other approach  ( Siggiridou  and Kugiumtzis,  2016 ) restricts  the number  
of past values of each variable  using time-ordered  supervised  sequential  
selection  to add lags that decrease  the Bayesian  Information  Criterion.  
This approach  is speciﬁcally  tailored  for time series, in contrast  to more 
widely applied  sparse regression  subset selection  techniques  such as the 
LASSO ( Antonacci  et al., 2020 ; Antonacci  et al., 2019 ; Valdes-Sosa  et al., 
2005 ). 
Sparse regression  approaches  use a regularizer  during the model- 
ﬁtting step, unlike PCA and variable  or lag selection  techniques,  which 
are processing  steps implemented  prior to model-ﬁtting.  LASSO retains 
essential  coeﬃcients,  i.e., those explaining  the most variance  in the 
training  data, while setting smaller  coeﬃcients  or those with less ex- 
planatory  power to zero. The group LASSO (gLASSO)  approach  encour-  
ages sparse connections  between  nodes by shrinking  all the coeﬃcients  
associated  with smaller  node-node  interactions  in the model to zero si- 
multaneously  ( Bolstad  et al., 2011 ; Haufe et al., 2010 ). The gLASSO  en- 
hances the interpretability  of the resulting  sparse model since it focuses  
on sparsity  of connections  rather than isolated  coeﬃcients.  While the 
gLASSO  oﬀers the potential  for signiﬁcant  reduction  in the number  of 
connections,  the computational  cost is much higher than OLS because  
it requires  an iterative  solution  and selection  of a sparsity  tuning pa- 
rameter,  typically  using cross-validation.  Both rPCA and gLASSO  meth- 
ods have been used separately  in previous  studies,  they have yet to be 
combined.  The motivation  for combining  them is to reduce the compu-  
tational  cost of gLASSO  by reducing  the dimensionality  of the gLASSO  
problem.  
The primary  goal of this work is to compare  systematically  the per- 
formance  of OLS, rPCA, gLASSO,  and combined  rPCA-gLASSO  with 
limited data from high-dimensional  physiologically  plausible  iEEG net- 
works. To this end, we ﬁrst show that high-dimensional  iEEG data (117 
–216 electrodes)  can be ﬁt successfully  using MVAR models provided  
suﬃcient  data is available.  We then explore  the performance  of diﬀer- 
ent approaches  for recovering  MVAR models and connectivity  proﬁles  in 
the limited data regime.  Physiologically  realistic  simulated  data is cre- 
ated using using MVAR models estimated  from human iEEG data with 
long data lengths.  The simulated  networks  provide  physiologically  plau- 
sible ground-truth  models for evaluation  of various  estimation  meth- 
ods. We use simulated  data to assess how the combination  of gLASSO  
and rPCA methods  compares  with rPCA-only,  gLASSO-only,  and stan- 
dard OLS methods,  showcasing  the relative  performance  of each mod- 
eling strategy.  Speciﬁcally,  we measure  each modeling  strategy’s  ability 
to recover  the known ground  truth using two metrics.  First, we mea- 
sure the ﬁdelity  of the estimated  network  model to the true network  
by computing  the mean-square  prediction  error for data not used to es- 
timate the model. Second,  we compare  the estimated  regional  connec-  
tivity to the ground  truth based on the broadband  block gPDC (bPDC)  
measure  of Faes and Nollo (2013) . We show that gLASSO  can capture  
essential  features  of connectivity  even in very limited data regimes,  mo- 
tivating  an illustration  of using gLASSO  to assess dynamic  connectiv-  
ity. In addition  to these simulation  experiments,  we apply each method  
to resting-state  data derived  from high-dimensional  iEEG recordings  
to demonstrate  their relative  abilities  to recover  plausible  connectivity  
proﬁles.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Overview  
Our goal was to develop  methods  for reliably  ﬁtting MVAR mod- 
els to high-dimensional  neural data. The performance  of rPCA and 
gLASSO  estimation  methods  were objectively  evaluated  on simulated  
data generated  by physiologically  realistic  “ground-truth  ” networks.

Data-predictive  and network  connectivity  metrics  were employed  to 
assess estimation  ﬁdelity  as a function  of data length. The physiolog-  
ically realistic  networks  used as ground-truth  benchmarks  in the simu- 
lation study were estimated  using long segments  of resting state iEEG 
data recorded  from neurosurgical  patients.  The Methods  section is di- 
vided into ﬁve sub-sections:  (1) human subjects  and iEEG recordings;  
(2) overview  of MVAR models;  (3) ground-truth  network  estimation;  
(4) methods  for estimating  MVAR models from simulated  data, includ- 
ing rPCA, gLASSO,  and rPCA-gLASSO;  (5) details of the metrics  used 
for assessing  estimator  performance,  including  the bPDC measure  we 
employed  to evaluate  regional  connectivity.  
2.2. Human subjects  and iEEG recordings  
2.2.1. Subjects  
iEEG data were used to derive ground-truth  networks  for simulation  
and to demonstrate  that plausible  connectivity  proﬁles  could be recov- 
ered using the approach  described  here. These data were obtained  from 
ten neurosurgical  patients  (6 female,  ages 21 - 48 years old, median  age 
34.5 years old; Table 1 ). The patients  had been diagnosed  with med- 
ically refractory  epilepsy  and were undergoing  chronic  invasive  iEEG 
monitoring  to identify  potentially  resectable  seizure foci. All human 
subject studies were carried out in accordance  with The Code of Ethics 
of the World Medical  Association  (Declaration  of Helsinki)  for experi- 
ments involving  humans.  The research  protocols  were approved  by the 
University  of Iowa Institutional  Review  Board and the National  Insti- 
tutes of Health.  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all sub- 
jects. Research  participation  did not interfere  with acquisition  of clini- 
cally required  data. Subjects  could rescind  consent  at any time without  
interrupting  their clinical  evaluation.  All subjects  were native English  
speakers,  right-handed,  and had left hemisphere  language  dominance,  
as determined  by Wada test. 
2.2.2. iEEG recordings  
Recordings  were made using subdural  and depth electrodes  (Ad-Tech  
Medical,  Oak Creek, WI) ( Fig. 1 A; Supplementary  Figure 1). After reject- 
ing electrodes  that were located  in seizure foci, white matter,  or out- 
side the brain, or for noise reasons  (see below),  the median  number  of 
recording  sites across the 10 subjects  was 174 (range 117 – 216; Sup- 
plementary  Figure 2; Table 2 ). Subdural  electrode  arrays consisted  of 
platinum-iridium  discs (2.3 mm diameter,  5-10 mm inter-electrode  dis- 
tance), embedded  in a silicon membrane.  These arrays provided  exten- 
sive coverage  of temporal,  frontal,  and parietal  cortex (Supplementary  
Figure 1). Depth arrays (8-12 electrodes,  5 mm inter-electrode  distance)  
targeted  insular cortex, hippocampus,  and amygdala,  and additionally  
provided  coverage  of the superior  temporal  plane and superior  temporal  
sulcus. Note that because  of the extensive  coverage  of auditory  cortical  
structures  in the temporal  lobe, and adjacent  auditory-related  cortical  
structures  in parietal  and frontal lobes, our scheme  for organizing  ROIs is auditory-centric.  A subgaleal  electrode,  placed over the cranial ver- 
tex near midline,  was used as a reference  in all subjects.  All electrodes  
were placed solely on the basis of clinical  requirements,  as determined  
by the team of epileptologists  and neurosurgeons  ( Nourski  and Howard,  
2015 ). 
No-task,  resting-state  (RS) data were recorded  in the dedicated,  elec- 
trically shielded  suite in The University  of Iowa Clinical  Research  Unit 
while the subjects  lay in the hospital  bed. No instructions  were given to 
the subjects  about keeping  eyes open or closed; because  these record-  
ings were made during daytime,  subjects  typically  had their eyes open 
during data collection.  Resting  state data were collected  a median  of 5.5 
days (range 2 –11 days) after electrode  implantation  surgery.  In the ﬁrst 
two subjects  (L307 and L357), data were recorded  using a TDT RZ2 real- 
time processor  (Tucker-Davis  Technologies,  Alachua,  FL). In the remain-  
ing 8 subjects  (R369 through  R532), data acquisition  was performed  us- 
ing a Neuralynx  Atlas System (Neuralynx  Inc., Bozeman,  MT). Recorded  
data were ampliﬁed,  ﬁltered  (0.1–500  Hz bandpass,  5 dB/octave  rolloﬀ
for TDT-recorded  data; 0.7–800  Hz bandpass,  12 dB/octave  rolloﬀ for  
Neuralynx-recorded  data) and digitized  at a sampling  rate of 2034.5 
Hz (TDT) or 2000 Hz (Neuralynx).  For 8/10 subjects,  the duration  of 
recordings  was 10 mins. For the other two subjects  (429R, 532R), the 
duration  was 11 minutes.

sponses  to a visual stimulus  were modulated  by the timing of the stimu- 
lus with respect to their cardiac  cycle. While past work failed to ﬁnd any 
cardiac  cycle eﬀect on the detection  of ﬂashes ( Elliott and Graf, 1972 ), 
the majority  of previous  studies highlighted  a signiﬁcant  impact of car- 
diac phase on visual processing.  For example,  the presentation  of visual 
stimuli at systole compared  to diastole  has been shown to inﬂuence  re- 
action times towards  these stimuli,  with most studies ﬁnding  prolonged  
reaction  times during the systole ( McIntyre  et al., 2007 ; Sandman  et al., 
1977 , but see also: Makowski  et al. (2021) . Processing  visual stimuli 
presented  at cardiac  systole compared  to diastole  evoked  smaller  visual 
evoked  potentials  ( Walker  and Sandman,  1982 ) and resulted  in reduced  
interference  of visually  distracting  stimuli ( Pramme  et al., 2014 , 2016 ). 
In addition,  cardiac  cycle eﬀects have been found to be modulated  by the 
emotional  valence  of the visual stimuli:  while fearful faces were detected  
more easily and rated as more intense  if presented  at systole compared  
with diastole,  the detection  of neutral,  disgusted,  or happy faces was 
comparable  across the two cardiac  phases ( Garﬁnkel  et al., 2014 ). Given 
that cardiac  signals are conveyed  to the brain mainly during the car- 
diac systole rather than the diastole  ( Azzalini  et al., 2019 ; Garﬁnkel  and 
Critchley,  2016 ), it can be assumed  that cardiac  signals may inﬂuence  
the perception  and neural processing  of a simultaneous  visual stimu- 
lus. This assumption  is also supported  by the ﬁnding  that visual evoked  
potentials  are enhanced  when these images are synchronized  with par- 
ticipants’  heartbeats  compared  to when they are presented  out of syn- 
chrony to participants’  heartbeats  ( Ronchi et al., 2017 ). By measuring  
neural markers  of cardiac  processing  such as the HEP and insula activ- 
ity ( Coll et al., 2021 ; Salomon  et al., 2018 ), recent studies have fur- 
ther provided  evidence  about the interplay  between  cardiac  processing  
and visual processing.  For example,  the amplitude  of the pre-stimulus  
heartbeat-evoked  potential  positively  predicts  subsequent  visual detec- 
tion ( Park et al., 2014 ). Additionally,  contrary  to the ﬁnding  reported  
by Ronchi et al. (2017) , Salomon  et al. (2016) observed  that visual stim- 
uli presented  at participants’  cardiac  frequency  take longer to enter vi- 
sual awareness  and induce smaller  activation  in the insular cortex. Up 
to now, it is still unclear  how simultaneously  encountered  cardiac  sig- 
nals and visual information  are integrated  into the brain. Moreover,  
previous  studies mainly examined  the inﬂuence  of cardiac  signals on 
the perception  of a single visual stimulus,  leaving  out the question  how 
cardio-visual  integration  can aﬀect the competition  among multiple  vi- 
sual stimuli.  
Here, we employed  a novel adaptation  of the dynamic  visual search 
task ( Van der Burg et al., 2008 , 2011 ) to investigate  the multisensory  
integration  of cardiac  signals with a visual target in a dynamic  cluttered  
environment,  while recording  the electrocardiogram  (ECG) and elec- 
troencephalogram  (EEG). Critically,  the visual target changed  its color 
either at a time when cardiac  arousal  signals were strongly  present  (i.e., 
at the end of ventricular  systole)  or when cardiac  arousal  was relatively  
low and thus did not provide  a strong signal (i.e., at the end of ven- 
tricular  diastole).  Consistent  with both recent reviews  ( Azzalini  et al., 
2019 ; Quigley  et al., 2021 ) and empirical  studies ( Ronchi et al., 2017 ; 
Sel et al., 2017 ), we treated visual and cardiac  signals as sensory  input 
signals of equal relevance.  At the behavioral  level, we measured  reaction  
times and accuracy  rates. At the electrophysiological  level, we explored  
the brain dynamics  of cardio-visual  integration  from two diﬀerent  per- 
spectives.  The ﬁrst perspective  was to compare  the electrophysiolog-  
ical responses  to the bimodal  cardio-visual  stimulus  (i.e., the concur-  
rence of cardiac  arousal  signals and the target change)  with the sum 
of the electrophysiological  responses  to the unimodal  cardiac  arousal  
signals and the unimodal  visual stimulus  (i.e., the target change).  This 
comparison  approach  (i.e., the additive  model) has been widely used 
in previous  EEG studies to reveal early multisensory  processes  under- 
lying auditory-visual  integration  ( Senkowski  et al., 2011 ; Talsma  and 
Woldorﬀ,  2005 ; Van der Burg et al., 2011 ; Zhao et al., 2020 , 2018 ). In 
the present  study, this approach  was applied  in analyses  of both event- 
related potentials  (ERPs) and neural oscillations.  According  to the ad- 
ditive model ( Cappe et al., 2010 ; Senkowski  et al., 2011 ; Talsma  and Woldorﬀ,  2005 ), electrophysiological  responses  to the simultaneous  car- 
diac and visual input would be diﬀerent  from the sum of the cardiac  and 
visual responses  alone if multisensory  integration  occurred  across car- 
diac processing  and visual processing  in the brain. Second,  the lateral-  
ized presentation  of the visual target in the visual ﬁeld made it possible  
to compare  the lateralized  electrophysiological  responses  to the bimodal  
cardio-visual  stimulus  and the unimodal  visual stimulus.  We mainly fo- 
cused on the lateralized  N2pc component  and alpha/beta  oscillations,  
which are well-validated  measures  of the allocation  of attention  to lat- 
eralized  visual stimuli ( Bacigalupo  and Luck, 2019 ; Bauer et al., 2012 ). 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twenty-six  participants  (12 females;  mean age: 25.46 ± 0.87 years; 
range: 20–38 years) took part in the present  study for payment  (9 €per 
h) or student  credits.  All participants  reported  normal  or corrected-to-  
normal  vision, no color blindness,  no diagnosed  heart-rhythm  abnormal-  
ities, no present  or past psychiatric  or neurological  disorders,  and no cur- 
rent use of medication.  Consent  was obtained  from all participants,  and 
the procedures  were approved  by the local ethics committee  at the De- 
partment  of Psychology  of LMU Munich  in accordance  with the Declara-  
tion of Helsinki.  To the best of our knowledge,  no previous  studies have 
explored  cardio-visual  integration  in a similar task. Therefore,  we could 
not compute  the required  sample size a priori. However,  our sample size 
is comparable  with relevant  previous  studies (e.g., Adelhöfer  et al. 2020 ; 
Marshall  et al. 2022 ; Pramme  et al. 2016 ). 
2.2. Experiment  design 
Participants  completed  a dynamic  visual search task in which a dis- 
play of randomly  oriented  line segments  changed  color dynamically  
( Van der Burg et al., 2008 ). Each display  consisted  of several oblique  
lines (the distractors),  and only one line which was perfectly  horizon-  
tal or vertical  (the target).  The participants  had to identify  the target as 
quickly  as possible  by indicating  if it was horizontal  or vertical  via but- 
ton press. To investigate  the cardio-visual  integration,  the experiment  
contained  two conditions  in which the visual target changed  color when 
cardiac  arousal  signals were relatively  low (i.e., when arterial  barore-  
ceptors  are relatively  quiescent;  corresponding  to the end of ventricular  
diastole)  or strong (i.e., when arterial  baroreceptors  ﬁre strongly;  corre- 
sponding  to the end of ventricular  systole;  see Fig. 1 A). The ventricular  
systole refers to the period from approximately  the ECG R-peak to the 
T wave, and the ventricular  diastole  refers to the period from approxi-  
mately the T wave to the next upcoming  R-peak ( DeSaix et al., 2018 ). 
In the diastole  coupling  condition,  the color change of the visual tar- 
get was designed  to always occur at the R-peak to coincide  with the 
end of ventricular  diastole.  In the systole coupling  condition,  the color 
change of the visual target was designed  to always occur at 290 ms af- 
ter the R-peak (approximately  at the T wave) to coincide  with the end 
of ventricular  systole ( Rae et al., 2020 , 2018 ). Participants  completed  
10 diastole  coupling  blocks and 10 systole coupling  blocks presented  in 
counterbalanced,  alternating  order and preceded  by 1 practice  block. 
Each block consisted  of 24 trials. In addition  to the 20 blocks for the 
visual search task, one resting block (duration:  2.5 min) was performed  
before the task. During the resting block, participants  were asked to look 
at the ﬁxation  dot centrally  presented  on the monitor  while no other vi- 
sual stimuli were presented.  The EEG signal obtained  from this type of 
resting condition  has been used to correct for cardiac  cycle-related  ar- 
tifacts present  in the EEG signal of task conditions  in previous  studies 
( Ronchi et al., 2017 ; van Elk et al., 2014 ).

Fig. 1. The dynamic  visual search task. (A) Schematic  illustration  of the experimental  conditions.  In the diastole coupling  condition,  the color change of the visual 
target always occurred  at the R-peak to coincide  with the end of ventricular  diastole (i.e., when cardiac arousal signals were relatively  low). In the systole coupling  
condition,  the color change of the visual target always occurred  at 290 ms after the R-peak to coincide  with the end of ventricular  systole (i.e., when cardiac arousal 
signals were strong). (B) An example  visual search display. The search display consisted  of 1 target (horizontal  or vertical)  and 49 distractors  (oblique).  In the example  
display, the target consists of the vertical red line on the right side. The colors of the target and the distractors  (green or red) were randomly  assigned  and changed  
randomly  over time. Participants  were required  to indicate  the orientation  of the visual target as fast and accurately  as possible.

Recently,  an emerging  area of research  has been in the use of 
spatiotemporal  correlation  to achieve  high acceleration  for quantita-  
tive MRI. For example,  MR ﬁngerprinting  ( Boyacioglu  et al., 2021 ; 
Cloos et al., 2016 ; Hong et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2015 ; Liao et al., 
2017 ; Ma et al., 2013 , 2018a , b ; Wyatt et al., 2018 ) and MR multi- 
tasking  ( Christodoulou  et al., 2018 ; Ma et al., 2020 , Ma et al., 2021 ) 
have utilized  spatiotemporal  correlation  between  readouts  after dif- 
ferent RF excitations  to accelerate  multi-parametric  imaging,  which 
have shown promising  results especially  when used in conjunction  with 
the low-rank  subspace  model ( Christodoulou  et al., 2018 ; Lam and 
Liang, 2014 ; Liang, 2007 ; Tamir et al., 2017 ; Zhao et al., 2018 ). An- 
other approach,  Echo Planar Time-resolved  Imaging  (EPTI) ( Dong et al., 
2021a ; Dong et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019a ; Wang et al., 2019b ; 
Wang et al., 2021 ), has been developed  recently  to provide  dense data 
sampling  and exploit the spatiotemporal  correlation  within a continu-  
ous EPI-like  readout.  Within the readout,  data are densely  sampled  at 
a short timescale  (submillisecond),  so only minimal  phase accumula-  
tion and signal decay will occur, resulting  in high temporal  correlation  
to reconstruct  the highly-accelerated  data. In addition,  it takes advan- 
tage of the spatial information  from multi-channel  coils by employing  
a novel spatiotemporal  encoding  strategy  within the readout  for fur- 
ther acceleration.  The continuous  EPTI readout  enables  high sampling  
eﬃciency  with minimal  dead time, while the time-resolving  approach  
across the readout  eliminates  the undesirable  image distortion  and blur- 
ring common  in the conventional  EPI ( Mansﬁeld,  1977 ), providing  a 
series of high quality multi-contrast  images sampled  at small time inter- 
val that can continuously  track the signal evolution.  We have demon-  
strated eﬃcient  whole brain T 2 and T 2 ∗ mapping  using a GE-SE EPTI se- 
quence at 1.1-mm  in-plane  resolution  within 28 s in our previous  work 
( Wang et al., 2019a ). 
Here, in pursuit of a signiﬁcant  further increase  in acceleration  capa- 
bility, 3D-EPTI  has been developed.  3D-EPTI  extends  the spatiotempo-  
ral EPTI encoding  from 2D ( k y -t ) to 3D ( k y -k z -t ), and develops  a new 
data sampling  strategy  with a combined  controlled-  and incoherent-  
aliasing  scheme.  Data correlations  at multiple  timescales  are exploited,  
both within and between  the continuous  readouts.  Within readouts,  a 
spatiotemporal  encoding  is designed  with complementary  sampling  in a 
controlled-aliasing  ( Breuer et al., 2005 ; Breuer et al., 2006 ; Dong et al., 
2019 ) (CAIPI)  pattern  in the k y -k z -t domain,  which uses the coil sen- 
sitivity information  along both the partition  and phase encoding  di- 
rections  along with the temporal  correlation  across echoes,  and oﬀers 
a high acceleration  capacity  (e.g., 80 ×in k-t ). Between  readouts,  a 
novel radial-block  encoding  is developed  to exploit data correlation  in a 
longer timescale  based on the compressed  sensing  theory ( Lustig et al., 
2007 ). The radial-block  sampling  creates incoherent  aliasing  along time 
that can be well excluded  from the coherent  signal evolutions,  there- 
fore provides  another  10 ×acceleration  in k-t space. The integration  
of the continuous  readout,  the spatiotemporal  CAIPI and the radial- 
block encoding  provides  datasets  with high correlation,  which allows 
for ∼800 ×acceleration  in the spatiotemporal  domain  and enables  re- 
construction  of thousands  of multi-contrast  3D images by combining  
with the low-rank  subspace  reconstruction  approach  ( Dong et al., 2020 ; 
Guo et al., 2021 ; He et al., 2016 ; Lam and Liang, 2014 ; Liang, 2007 ; 
Meng et al., 2021 ; Tamir et al., 2017 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). While this ac- 
quisition  scheme  can be applied  or adapted  to any sequence  or other 
types of readouts  to track the signal evolution  and to measure  a va- 
riety of quantitative  parameters,  this work employs  speciﬁc  sequence  
to simultaneously  obtain MR relaxation  time constants  T 1 , T 2 , T 2 ∗ as 
well as RF ﬁeld inhomogeneity  (B 1 + ) and proton density  (PD). We 
demonstrated  the ability of 3D-EPTI  to acquire  high-quality  whole- 
brain multi-parametric  maps at isotropic  1.5-mm  in 1 minute or at 
isotropic  1-mm in 3 minutes  with high repeatability  and reliability.  An 
isotropic  0.7-mm  3D-EPTI  protocol  was also developed  to enable,  for 
the ﬁrst time, the examination  of simultaneously  acquired  T 1 , T 2 , and 
T 2 ∗ in less than 10 minutes  to help better investigate  the intra-cortical  
architecture.  2. Material  and methods  
2.1. 3D-EPTI  overview  
3D-EPTI  acquires  highly-accelerated  k-t data using continuous  read- 
outs to track signal evolutions  with minimal  deadtime  and high read- 
out eﬃciency.  Time-varying  undersampling  patterns  are employed  to 
exploit the spatiotemporal  correlation  within and among readouts  for 
robust reconstruction  at high acceleration.  In the time domain,  the full 
signal evolutions  are represented  by a small number  of low-rank  sub- 
space bases in the reconstruction  process  to reduce the number  of un- 
knowns.  In the spatial domain,  the time-varying  complementary  sam- 
pling further improves  the reconstruction  based on principles  of parallel  
imaging  ( Griswold  et al., 2002 ; Pruessmann  et al., 1999 ; Sodickson  and 
Manning,  1997 ) and compressed  sensing  ( Lustig et al., 2007 ). Paral- 
lel imaging  helps the recovery  of undersampling  by taking advantage  
of the CAIPI-like  k-t controlled  aliasing  patterns.  Compressed  sensing  
(in the form of low-rank  regularization  on the basis coeﬃcient  maps) 
further reduces  aliasing  by exploiting  the incoherence  of the aliasing  
patterns  along both the spatial and temporal  dimensions.  After recon- 
struction,  the signal evolution  at each voxel is obtained,  expressed  as a 
linear combination  of the temporal  subspace  bases, which will then be 
used to match the simulated  signal evolutions  (dictionary)  to estimate  
the quantitative  parameters.  
2.2. 3D-EPTI  acquisition  
Fig. 1 illustrates  the 3D-EPTI  acquisition.  An inversion-recovery  
gradient  echo (IR-GE)  and a variable-ﬂip-angle  gradient-and-spin-echo  
( Feinberg  and Oshio, 1991 ; Oshio and Feinberg,  1991 ) (VFA-GRASE)  
sequence  ( Fig. 1 a) were employed  to provide  signal evolutions  that are 
sensitive  to T 1 , T 2 , and T 2 ∗ relaxations  ( Fig. 1 b). After each RF ex- 
citation,  a 3D-EPTI  readout  is acquired,  which continuously  captures  
the temporal  signal evolution  with eﬃcient  bipolar  gradient.  To re- 
solve images within the readout  with high acceleration,  a spatiotem-  
poral CAIPI encoding  is employed  in a 4D spatiotemporal  ( k x -k y -k z - t ) 
domain  ( Fig. 1 d, the readout  dimension  k x is fully-sampled  and there- 
fore omitted  in the illustration).  At each time point within the readout,  
a particular  phase and partition  position  ( k y -k z ) is acquired  that is in- 
terleaved  to its neighboring  time points in a ‘controlled-aliasing’  pat- 
tern. Across a slightly  longer timescale,  two complementary  patterns  
are interleaved  across echoes (orange  and green points in Fig. 1 d, dif- 
ferent ‘echo sections’,  each contains  multiple  echoes)  to provide  more 
independent  k -space sampling  locations,  which has been shown to fur- 
ther improve  the reconstruction  performance  at high acceleration  rates 
( Dong et al., 2020 ). Each 3D-EPTI  readout  covers a relatively  small block 
in k y -k z - t space to ensure that the neighboring  k y -k z samplings  are close 
in time. The CAIPI pattern,  the complementary  sampling  across echoes,  
and the proximity  in time together  result in high spatiotemporal  corre- 
lation and allow for eﬀective  use of the available  coil sensitivity  infor- 
mation.  Therefore,  the highly-undersampled  data (e.g., undersampling  
rate = 80 ×in k-t space) at each time point can be well reconstructed,  
resolving  a series of images across the readout  at a submillisecond  time 
interval  ( Fig. 1 d, left). 
In each repetition  time (TR), multiple  k - t blocks can be acquired  
across multiple  readouts  after diﬀerent  excitations  ( Fig. 1 c, blocks in the 
same color are acquired  in the same TR). Here, TR refers to the overall 
repetition  time of IR-GE or VFA-GRASE,  and therefore  includes  multi- 
ple readouts  (e.g., in IR-GE, it includes  the time for an inversion  pulse 
and the following  multiple  small-ﬂip-angle  GE excitations).  To quickly  
encode the 4D k-t space using a small number  of TRs, a golden-angle  
radial-block  Cartesian  sampling  is employed  across diﬀerent  readouts.  
Speciﬁcally,  the blocks acquired  after the same excitation  in diﬀerent  
TRs form a diagonal  radial blade in the k y - k z space, with diﬀerent  blade 
angulations  across diﬀerent  readouts.  This was developed  to create a 
favorable  spatiotemporal  incoherent  aliasing  across the readouts  that

space at every TI or SE, a radial-block  Cartesian  sampling  pattern is utilized to quickly sample the k-t space in a small number of TRs. At each TI or SE, the k y -k z - t blocks 
acquired  in diﬀerent  TRs (color-coded)  form a radial blade with diﬀerent  angulations  to create spatiotemporal  incoherent  aliasing for constrained  reconstruction  and

is well suited for constrained  reconstruction,  which permits  a further 
∼10 ×acceleration  through  acquiring  only a few blades for each read- 
out instead  of the full k y - k z sampling.

typical analyses  of spontaneous  (resting-state)  fMRI remove  physiologi-  
cal artifacts  (motion,  respiration,  cardiac  rhythms,  etc.) and assume  the 
residual  signal is the neural signal of interest  ( Power et al., 2020 ). It 
is typically  presumed  that this signal is equally  present  at all moments  
and FC is calculated  using all available  data over long periods.  How- 
ever, recent work suggested  that rather than being constantly  present,  
FC information  might be inordinately  present  at particular  time points 
called “events  ”( Esfahlani  et al., 2020 ). Esfahlani  and colleagues  found 
that “events,  ”t i m e points with the highest  BOLD signal coﬂuctuation,  
reproduce  static functional  connectivity  patterns  better than the same 
number  of “non-events,  ”time points with the lowest BOLD signal coﬂuc- 
tuation,  and require  relatively  few timepoints  to reproduce  them well. 
The authors  concluded  that rather than functional  network  structure  
being present  at all timepoints,  it is driven by events –a discrete  and 
temporally  sparse phenomena  ( Esfahlani  et al., 2020 ). The idea that 
brain network  information  can be identiﬁed  in a reduced  data set is 
not new. Previous  approaches  such as co-activation  patterns  (CAPS)  and 
point-process  analysis  (PPA) have been used to identify  a small num- 
ber of points which can capture  functional  network  information  (Liu & 
Duyn, 2013; Tagliazucchi  et al., 2012), but events are unique in that 
they do not require  the speciﬁcation  of a seed region or threshold  for 
high-amplitude  activity  (Esfahlani  et al., 2020). This idea has deep im- 
plications  for the ﬁeld: a thorough  analysis  of events across brain orga- 
nizational  levels (e.g., from systems  to cellular  recordings)  could reveal 
information  about the physiological  mechanisms  of FC and new analy- 
sis methods  focused  on events could improve  the clinical  utility of fMRI 
( Esfahlani  et al., 2021 ; Greenwell  et al., 2021 ). 
However,  there are alternative  interpretations  of these ﬁndings  
which have not yet been explored.  First, it is possible  that diﬀerences  be- 
tween events and non-events  are driven by contamination  in non-events  
(motion,  respiration,  etc.) rather than by a unique signal present  during 
events. Second,  it has been shown that random  sampling  variability  in 
BOLD data is high and alone can create the appearance  of discrete  states 
in stationary  FC simulations  ( Hlinka & Hadrava,  2015 ; Laumann  et al., 
2017 ). This principle  may apply here too –s a m p l i n g  variability  could 
make a subset of single points look extreme,  even if they are drawn from 
a continuous  distribution  around a static FC matrix (note that if this were 
the case, events methodology  may still be a useful way to rapidly  and 
accurately  reproduce  static FC structure,  but this outcome  would sug- 
gest that a deep focus on events physiology  relative  to other timepoints  
has less utility).  Recent work has provided  a mathematical  basis for how 
this could be the case. ( Novelli  & Razi, 2022 ). In this paper, we ask (1) 
if events are unique points which drive FC, (2) if non-events  are unique 
points with high contamination,  or (3) if events and non-events  are an 
expected  consequence  of static FC and sampling  variability.  
To answer these questions,  we conduct  a series of analyses  on real 
and simulated  data. First, we use real data from the Midnight  Scan Club 
dataset to test how unique events and non-events  are by examining  
whether  their properties  diﬀer markedly  from intermediate  timepoints.  
Second,  we create models of simulated  static BOLD data to see if sam- 
pling variability  on a static signal is suﬃcient  to explain  event behavior.  
Finally,  we examine  why events are able to recreate  static FC structure  
with so few time points. 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Overview  and Dataset 
The goal of this project was to investigate  if high coﬂuctuation  mo- 
ments in resting state fMRI BOLD signals are discrete  events that drive 
functional  connectivity.  We used a combination  of real and simulated  
data for these analyses.  
The publicly  available  Midnight  Scan Club (MSC) dataset was used 
as our real sample dataset.  The MSC dataset contains  fMRI data from 
10 highly sampled  individuals  (5 females,  ages 24-34).  The data for each subject was collected  across 10 fMRI sessions  within 7 weeks. 
Across these sessions,  the MSC dataset includes  5 hours of resting state 
fMRI; this resting-state  data is the focus of our analyses.  One participant  
(MSC08)  has been excluded  from these analyses  because  of head motion 
and drowsiness  during rest. For single session-analysis  and simulations,  
sessions  with less than 333 usable timepoints  (6/90 sessions)  were ex- 
cluded.  All data collection  was approved  by the Washington  University  
Internal  Review  Board and written  informed  consent  was received  from 
all participants.  The dataset and processing  have been previously  de- 
scribed  in detail ( Gordon  et al., 2017 ). A summary  of relevant  details is 
provided  below. 
2.2. MRI Acquisition

and a facilitation  of the recognition  of emotional  changes,  accompanied  
by a more precise adaptation  to emotion  probabilities  ( Hübner  et al., 
2021 ). Low interoceptive  abilities  on the other hand have been related to 
alexithymia,  a subclinical  phenomenon  characterized  by diﬃculties  in 
identifying  and describing  feelings  and associated  with impaired  expres-  
sion recognition  ( Brewer  et al., 2016 ; Cook et al., 2013 ; Herbert  et al., 
2011 ; Sowden  et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless,  there are diﬀerent  restrictive  
deﬁnitions  and still no consensus  on the exact conception  of interocep-  
tion. In this paper, we refer to a distinction  based on various  measures  
of interoceptive  abilities  according  to Garﬁnkel  (2015) , diﬀerentiating  
between  interoceptive  accuracy  (IAcc), operationalized  as accuracy  in 
detection  of the heartbeat,  interoceptive  sensibility  (IS) as self-reported  
measure  regarding  the individual  evaluation  of the ability to perceive  
body signals,  and interoceptive  awareness  (IAw), deﬁned  as a metacog-  
nitive component  in the sense of the degree of concordance  between  IS 
and IAcc. 
The neuroanatomical  brain regions  involved  in interoceptive  pro- 
cessing extend from viscero-motor  areas (VMAs),  through  the insula cor- 
tex and the anterior  cingulate  cortex (ACC), to the orbitofrontal  cortex 
(OFC), which is assumed  to be situated  at the top of the interoceptive  hi- 
erarchy  ( Ainley et al., 2016 ; Barrett and Simmons,  2015; Garﬁnkel  and 
Critchley,  2013; Seth and Friston,  2016 ). AIC, ACC and OFC have con- 
nections  to hypothalamus,  brain stem nuclei and spinal cord that pre- 
sumably  transmit  allostatic  predictions  which modulate  the set-points  
of homeostatic  reﬂexes  ( Stephan  et al., 2016 ). Regarding  these intero- 
ceptive  pathways,  structurally  and functionally  closely connected  insula 
and ACC are thought  to be the most important  cortical  region activated  
by most interoceptive  and aﬀective  stimuli ( Ainley et al., 2016 ; Bar- 
rett and Simmons,  2015; Craig, 2009 ; Medford  and Critchley,  2010; 
Menon and Uddin, 2010). In several studies,  Wiebking  and colleagues  
found correlations  between  insular interoceptive  activity  and depres-  
sive aﬀect, as well as group diﬀerences  during interoceptive  awareness  
in the insula regions,  with hypo-response  of individuals  with depression  
( Wiebking  et al., 2011 , 2015 , 2014). Imaging  studies provide  evidence  
that these clusters  are also involved  in cerebral  processing  of emotions.  
For example,  recent studies show overlaps  of interoceptive  signaling,  
emotion  perception  and social cognition,  especially  in the right anterior  
insular cortex (AIC) and frontotemporal  regions  (Pollatos  et al., 2005; 
Zaki, Davis, & Ochsner,  2012 ; see Adolﬁet  al., 2017 for meta-analysis).  
Consequently,  it can be assumed  that increased  cortical  processing  in 
these areas implies  an advantage  not only for the more accurate  ap- 
praisal of one’s own bodily signals,  but that this better access to one’s 
own interoceptive  signals is also beneﬁcial  for recognizing  the emotions  
of others. 
In the present  fMRI study, we aimed to investigate  the impact of 
individuals’  scoring  in IAcc and IS on their brain activity  and perfor- 
mance (reaction  times) in a probabilistic  emotion  classiﬁcation  task. 
The experimental  paradigm  required  participants  to indicate  whether  a 
videotaped  neutral  facial expression  develops  into a happy or fearful ex- 
pression.  To introduce  diﬀerent  levels of uncertainty,  facial expressions  
varied in intensity  at the end of the video. Moreover,  we implemented  
diﬀerent  probabilities  for the occurrence  of happy or fearful faces per 
block to assess participants’  propensity  to eﬃciently  update their pre- 
dictive model. We quantiﬁed  the diﬀerent  probabilities  by information-  
theoretic  measures,  i.e., Shannon  surprise  (i.e., the improbability  of an 
event) and entropy (i.e., the inverse  predictability  of a single stimulus),  
respectively,  and modeled  reaction  times as well as the variability  of 
BOLD amplitude  as a function  of surprise  and entropy  as parametric  
modulators  ( Shannon,  1948 ; Strange  et al., 2005 ; see Methods  for fur- 
ther details).  
We tested whether  individuals  with higher IS or IAcc recognize  oth- 
ers’ emotions  more easily and are more sensitive  to learn from biased 
probabilities  of emotional  expressions.  Here, it is important  to empha-  
size that objective  measures  of IAcc are not necessarily  correlated  with 
subjective  measures  of IS (e.g., Ceunen  et al., 2013 ; Forkmann  et al., 2016 ; Meessen  et al., 2016 ). However,  yet little is known about how in- 
terindividual  diﬀerences  in IS and IAcc aﬀect emotion  recognition.  Our 
study is one of the ﬁrst to directly  examine  how both measures  aﬀect 
emotion  recognition.  Based on the theoretical  framework,  we would ini- 
tially assume  that both higher IAcc and higher IS would have a beneﬁ- 
cial eﬀect on emotion  recognition  and context  adaptation.  In particular,  
we expected  individuals  with higher IS and IAcc to show lower thresh- 
olds for emotion  recognition,  reﬂected  in decreased  reaction  times for 
emotional  expressions  (Hypothesis  1, H1). More speciﬁcally,  based on 
the results from Hübner  et al. (2021) , we would assume  that especially  
individuals  with decreased  IS are slower in recognizing  more diﬃcult  
conditions,  i.e., low vs. high emotional  intensity  and fearful vs. happy 
valence  of facial expressions.  In addition,  individuals  with higher IS or 
IAcc should beneﬁt more from a biased probability  of an emotion,  which 
is reﬂected  in decreased  reaction  times for expected  emotions  (Hypoth-  
esis 2, H2) (see also Hübner  et al., 2021 ). 
On the neural level, we ﬁrstly investigated  functional  areas special-  
ized in the processing  of dynamically  unfolding  emotional  facial expres-  
sions depending  on intensity  and valence.  We expected  high vs. low 
intensity  of emotional  expressions  (Hypothesis  3, H3) to engage brain 
regions  involved  in the perception  of changeable  facial attributes  and 
recognition  of facial expressions,  i.e., the inferior  frontal gyrus (IFG), 
fusiform  gyrus, insula and amygdala  ( Calder et al., 2003 ; Furl et al., 
2010 ; Gallese  et al., 2004 ; Haxby et al., 2002 ; Jung et al., 2021 ). For 
fearful vs. happy unfolding  facial expressions,  we expected  increased  
neural activation  especially  in the amygdala  ( Adolphs  et al., 1994 ; 
Breiter et al., 1996 ; Calder,  1996 ; Fusar-Poli  et al., 2009 ). Secondly,  
regarding  the probabilistic  context  adaptation,  we expected  stimulus-  
bound surprise  to be positively  correlated  with activity  in regions  in- 
volved in the signaling  of (interoceptive)  prediction  errors, i.e., AIC, 
ACC and striatum  ( Schiﬀer  and Schubotz,  2011 ; Seth, 2013 ) (Hypoth-  
esis 4, H4), and entropy to be positively  correlated  with activity  in 
the hippocampus,  caudate  nucleus,  ACC, AIC and orbitofrontal  cor- 
tex (OFC) ( Ahlheim  et al., 2014 ; Bechara  et al., 2000; Herry et al., 
2007 ; Schiﬀer,  Ahlheim,  Wurm, & Schubotz,  2012 ; Strange  et al., 2005 ) 
(Hypothesis  5, H5). Finally,  since especially  the caudate  nucleus  is 
thought  to be associated  with perceptual  prediction  errors ( Schiﬀer  and 
Schubotz,  2011 ; Schiﬀer  et al., 2012 ), we expected  that participants’  
IAcc and IS correlates  positively  with activation  in the caudate  nucleus,  
as well as insula and ACC (i.e., brain regions  related to interoceptive  
processing  and signaling  of (interoceptive)  prediction  errors),  when con- 
fronted  with less predicted  or less predictable  emotions  (Hypothesis  6, 
H6). 
2. Materials  and methods  
2.1. Participants  
Forty-two  right-handed  healthy  young volunteers  ( M age = 21.00 
years, SD = 2.51, age range = 18-29 years, 34 women,  8 men) with nor- 
mal or corrected-to-normal  vision were included  in the present  study. 
None of them reported  a history of neurological  or psychiatric  disorders  
and all participants  met the criteria  for MRI scanning.  The study protocol  
was conducted  in accordance  with ethical standards  of the Declaration  
of Helsinki  and approved  by the Local Ethics Committee  of the Univer-  
sity of Muenster.  Each participant  submitted  a signed informed  consent  
form and received  either reimbursement  or course credits for their par- 
ticipation  afterwards.  Individuals  provided  written  informed  consent  to 
permit for all potentially  identifying  information  to be published.  
2.2. Stimulus  material

2.1. Human participants  
Eleven healthy  right-handed  volunteers  (5 males and 6 females;  age 
range 21–38 years) participated  in the fMRI experiments.  Six of them 
participated  after providing  informed  consent  to a protocol  approved  by 
the National  Institutes  of Health Combined  Neuroscience  Institutional  
Review  Board (93-M-0170,  ClinicalTrials.gov  identiﬁer:  NCT00001360)  
in accordance  with the Belmont  Report and U.S. Federal  Regulations  
protecting  human subjects.  Additional  ﬁve participants  gave written  in- 
formed  consent  under the local medical  ethics committee  at the National  
Institute  for Physiological  Sciences,  Japan. One female was re-invited  
to participate  in an additional  session (on a diﬀerent  day) to conﬁrm  
reproducibility;  therefore,  twelve experimental  sessions  ( n = 12) were 
conducted  in total. 
2.2. Experimental  session setup and image acquisition  
Each session consisted  of one ﬁnger somatotopic  mapping  run of 
9.9 min duration  and one or two prediction  task runs of 16 min du- 
ration. No participant  was in the scanner  for longer than 120 min per 
session.  
The same fMRI sequence  and image reconstruction  pipeline  was 
used as in our previous  study ( Yu et al., 2019 ). Slice-selective  slab- 
inversion  concurrent  measures  of VASO ( Lu et al., 2003 ) and BOLD sig- 
nals were acquired  using a 7T scanner  (Siemens  Healthineers,  Erlangen,  
Germany)  equipped  with a 32-channel  RF coil (Nova Medical,  Wilm- 
ington, MA, USA) and an SC72 body gradient  coil. The VASO-relevant  
TR-loop  acquisition  settings  were as follows:  TI1 nulled = 1100 ms, 
TI2 BOLD = 2845 ms, and TR pair = 3490 ms. The coil-combined  data com- 
prised interleaved  BOLD and VASO contrasts  obtained  as concomitant  
time series ( Huber et al., 2017 ). These time series are corrected  for rigid 
volume  motion and are separated  by contrast  with the eﬀective  tempo- 
ral resolution  of TR = 3490 ms for each individual  contrast.  The nominal  
resolution  was 0.71 mm across cortical  depths with 1.8-mm  thick slices 
perpendicular  to the postcentral  bank of the right central sulcus with 
3D-EPI ( Poser et al., 2010 ). VASO contrast  is corrected  for BOLD con- 
taminations  by the division  of blood nulled MR-signal  and not-nulled  
MR-signal  across consecutive  TRs. This was performed  based on 1–4 
short EPI test runs with 5 measurements  and their online depiction  in the 
vendor-provided  3D-viewer.  The higher detection  sensitivity  of BOLD 
(with low layer speciﬁcity)  was used to determine  the single-voxel  ac- 
tivity scores for subsequence  regions  of interest  (ROI) deﬁnition.  The 
higher layer speciﬁcity  of VASO (with lower sensitivity)  was used to 
extract layer-proﬁles  of voxel-averages  for each layer without  venous 
biases.

4. Results  
4.1. Behavioural  data 
Paired t-tests were conducted  to examine  whether  participants  re- 
sponded  diﬀerently  to static vs. motion events. No signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  
was found in their accuracies  (static M = 93.35%,  SD = 0.09, motion 
M = 95.11%,  SD = 0.08, t(25) = − 1.06, p > 0.3), but participants  reacted  
faster when processing  static events (static M = 1799 ms, SD = 452.02,  
motion M = 1931 ms, SD = 459.91,  t(25) = − 4.27, p < 0.0002).  In a lin- 
ear mixed eﬀects model controlling  for the eﬀect of run order and length 
of sentences,  the event type still had a signiﬁcant  eﬀect on reaction  time 
(t(2267)  = − 7.316, p < 0.001).  
4.2. fMRI data 
Three sets of analysis  were formed  on the fMRI data: univariate  
analyses,  multivariate  pattern  analyses  (MVPA)  and psychophysiolog-  
ical analyses  (PPI).

to conﬁrm  explorative  ﬁndings  of small sample studies or to study rare 
conditions  is increasingly  recognized  in neuroimaging  ( de Luca and Bies- 
sels, 2021 ; Turner et al., 2018 ). This is also demonstrated  by the impact 
of recent large cohort studies such as the UK Biobank  ( Allen et al., 2012 ) 
or the Human  Connectome  Project ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ). Achieving  
large sample sizes in a single acquisition  site is, however,  challenging.  
A common  alternative  is to collect data across multiple  sites. Neverthe-  
less, multi-site  acquisition  has limited usability  for dMRI, because  of 
marked  inter-site  variability.  Diﬀerences  in gradients  hardware,  receive  
and transmission  coils, magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogeneity  and reconstruc-  
tion software  contribute  to oﬀsets in the dMRI measurements,  introduc-  
ing complicated  and non-linear  site diﬀerences  in dMRI derived  metrics,  
even when identical  scanners  and acquisition  protocols  are employed  
( Mirzaalian  et al., 2016 ). 
Recently,  a cross-site  harmonization  method  based on rotational  
invariant  spherical  harmonics  (RISH) ( Cetin Karayumak  et al., 2019 ; 
Mirzaalian  et al., 2016 ) was proposed,  among others, to retrospectively  
harmonize  dMRI data collected  at multiple  sites. In the RISH features  
harmonization  method,  data from multiple  diﬀusion  directions  with the 
same b-value  (single-shell)  are deconstructed  into a set of spherical  har- 
monics up to a given order. Then, a RISH feature is computed  for each 
even harmonic  order as the squared  sum of the corresponding  harmonic  
coeﬃcients.  The RISH features  are calculated  for each voxel, or can be 
averaged  across regions  of interest.  Given dMRI data of matched  con- 
trol groups that have been collected  at two diﬀerent  acquisition  sites, 
the method  assumes  that any group diﬀerence  in the RISH features  is 
entirely  due to scanner-related  eﬀects. Accordingly,  harmonization  is 
trained  by learning  the spatially  varying  mapping  of the average  RISH 
features  from one site to another,  which can be then applied  to harmo-  
nize data of any given subject.  Because  the harmonization  can be per- 
formed  at the voxel-level,  the RISH method  can potentially  model bulk 
inter-scanner  diﬀerences,  but also scanner  diﬀerences  stemming  from 
spatial inhomogeneities  that might be due to diﬀerences  in gradients,  
coil sensitivity,  B0 and B1 ﬁelds, among others. Unlike methods  such as 
ComBat  ( Fortin et al., 2018 ) that perform  harmonization  at the statisti-  
cal inference  stage for each derived  measure  of interest,  the RISH-based  
method  harmonizes  the dMRI data once as part of the pre-processing.  
This allows for the subsequent  derivation  of any harmonized  measure  of 
interest  and for the application  of any analysis  method  of choice across 
the harmonized  subjects,  including  whole brain statistics,  region of in- 
terest based analysis,  tract based spatial statistics  or voxel-wise  analyses.  
Thanks  to the advent of novel acceleration  techniques  such as si- 
multaneous  multi slice ( Setsompop  et al., 2018 ), compressed  sensing  
( Ning et al., 2015 ), and other recent hardware  improvements,  the im- 
plementation  of dMRI protocols  beyond  the single-shell  is becoming  in- 
creasingly  popular  even in clinical  settings.  The most common  acqui- 
sition is of a set of spherically  distributed  gradient  directions  at multi- 
ple diﬀusion  weightings  (i.e., multi-shell  ). Multi-shell  data allows ﬁtting 
more complex  models than DTI, such as higher-order  models that ex- 
plore the non-Gaussian  and multi-exponential  nature of the dMRI signal, 
providing  complementary  and / or additional  information  to DTI metrics  
( De Luca, 2021 ). A popular  higher-order  model is the diﬀusion  kurtosis  
imaging  (DKI) ( Jensen et al., 2005 ; Jensen and Helpern,  2010 ) method,  
which extends  the DTI formalism  to the second order cumulants.  DKI 
models 3D diﬀusion  processes  that deviate  from Gaussianity  due to, 
for instance,  the presence  of membrane  restrictions  ( Fieremans  et al., 
2011 ) or intra-voxel  incoherent  motion eﬀects ( De Luca et al., 2017 ). 
The non-Gaussian  behavior  is quantiﬁed  as excess kurtosis  of the dif- 
fusion process  and has been shown to provide  complementary  infor- 
mation to DTI. For example,  DKI has provided  useful information  about 
the aging brain ( Falangola  et al., 2008 ), and has also been able to detect 
pathological  changes  with higher sensitivity  than DTI in patients  with 
Alzheimer’s  disease  ( Arab et al., 2018 ), among others. Another  family 
of methods  leveraging  multi-shell  acquisitions  are biophysical  models.  
Such models are often based on assumptions  on the tissue microstruc-  
ture, and aim to quantify  metrics  that directly  relate to speciﬁc  bio- physical  processes.  A popular  example  hereof is the “neurite  orientation  
dispersion  and density  imaging  ”(NODDI)  model, which over time has 
found widespread  application  to characterize  the healthy  and pathologic  
brain ( Calabrese  et al., 2017 ; Colon-Perez  et al., 2019 ; De Luca et al., 
2020 ; Parvathaneni  et al., 2017 ; Wen et al., 2019 ). 
In this work, we investigate  whether  the RISH-based  harmonization  
method  ( Cetin Karayumak  et al., 2019 ), which was previously  applied  
to harmonize  single-shell  dMRI data, could be eﬀectively  generalized  
to multi-shell  dMRI. We tested the eﬀect of the multi-site  harmoniza-  
tion on metrics  such as the mean kurtosis  (MK), FA, and MD derived  
from the DKI ﬁt, and orientation  dispersion  index (ODI), neurite  den- 
sity index (NDI) and isotropic  signal fraction  (ISO) maps from NODDI.  
A recent work ( Tax et al., 2019 ) provided  proof-of-concept  that this 
method  can be applied  to harmonize  MK across sites. However,  this was 
demonstrated  on a small group of subjects  ( “traveling  heads ”) scanned  
on a number  of MRI scanners.  Here, we study the application  of the 
RISH features  harmonization  on multi-shell  dMRI data from matching  
groups of healthy  controls  acquired  at 3 diﬀerent  sites at multiple  time 
points (TP). Taking advantage  of a longitudinal  study design, we aimed 
to verify the eﬀectiveness  of the RISH harmonization  procedure  at i) re- 
moving  baseline  cross-site  diﬀerences  in DKI and NODDI  values while 
ii) not altering  longitudinal  changes  in metrics  over TPs, which are ex- 
pected to occur in light of our study sample including  teenagers  between  
14 and 16 years, when rapid structural  brain changes  occur ( Das et al., 
2017 ; Falangola  et al., 2008 ). This eﬀect of harmonization  on longitu-  
dinal changes  in DKI and NODDI  metrics  was compared  between  the 
RISH-based  and ComBat  harmonization  approaches.  
Methods  
MRI acquisitions  
The dMRI data used in this study were acquired  in three acquisition  
sites located  in Norway  (Oslo, S1), Belgium  (Leuven,  S2) and Germany  
(Munich,  S3). All the sites were equipped  with 3T scanners  (Philips  
Healthcare,  Best, the Netherlands)  equipped  with the standard  32 chan- 
nels head coil. The MRI at S1 was an Ingenia  CX equipped  with a CDAS 
spectrometer,  and a gradient  system with maximum  amplitude  equal 
to 40mT/m.  The MRI at S2 was an Achieva  dStream  equipped  with 
DDAS spectrometer,  and a gradient  system with maximum  amplitude  
equal to 65mT/m.  The MRI at S3 was an Ingenia  equipped  with a CDAS 
spectrometer,  and a gradient  system with maximum  amplitude  equal to 
40mT/m.  While all scanners  were running  on software  R5.3 at the be- 
ginning  of the data acquisition  process,  Site1 and Site2 were respectively  
updated  to R5.4.1 and R5.4, before acquisition  was completed.  
The dMRI acquisition  was performed  at a resolution  of 2 ×2 ×2mm 3 . 
In S2 and S3, the sequence  was accelerated  with multi-band  factor 2 and 
parallel  acceleration  SENSE 1.5, resulting  in echo time 113 ms and repe- 
tition time 7.2 s. S1 did not have multi-band  functionality,  and therefore  
the repetition  time was changed  to 12 s and SENSE to 2 to match the res- 
olution  of Sites 1 and 3, while achieving  the same echo time (113 ms). 
The dMRI acquisition  of all the three sites included  the same gradient  
table which included  20 x b = 1000s/mm  2 and 30 x b = 2500s/mm  2 in 
addition  to 7 non-weighted  images.  Additionally,  4 non-weighted  im- 
ages with identical  imaging  parameters  but reversed  phase encoding  
(anterior-posterior)  were acquired  in each site to correct for EPI-related  
geometrical  distortions.  Additional  shells that included  less than 15 gra- 
dient directions,  required  to derive RISH features  of order 4 or above, 
were omitted  from this proof-of-concept  demonstration.  
Study participants  
The participants  of this study were young male teenagers  recruited  
as part of the longitudinal  REPIMPACT  study ( Koerte et al., 2021 ). A 
total of 46 unique subjects  were included  in this study. Each subject 
underwent  1 to 3 MRI sessions,  for a total of 79 datasets  ( Table 1 ).

Data processing  and harmonization  
The dMRI data were corrected  for signal drift ( Vos et al., 2016 ) using 
ExploreDTI  ( Leemans  et al., 2009 ) v4.8.6. A brain mask was derived  for 
each subject using FSL BET ( Smith, 2002 ). To remove  EPI distortions,  
FSL TOPUP  ( Andersson  et al., 2003 ) was applied  on the mask, together  
with the non-weighted  images of both phase encodings.  Subsequently,  
FSL EDDY ( Andersson  and Sotiropoulos,  2016 ) 5.11 was used to cor- 
rect for subject motion,  eddy currents  and EPI distortions  in a single 
step. 
The data corresponding  to the b = 1000s/mm  2 shell (20 gradient  
directions)  and to the b = 2500s/mm  2 (30 gradient  directions)  were 
ﬁtted with spherical  harmonics  of order 4 (L4) and 6 (L6), respec- 
tively. To perform  the harmonization,  S1 was chosen as a reference  
site, since it included  the largest number  of subjects.  For each site to 
be harmonized,  a study-speciﬁc  template  was generated  with ANTS 
( Avants et al., 2014 ) using selected  training  subjects  of the reference  
and other site. Speciﬁcally,  the study template  was created  following  
the script “antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2.sh  ”of ANTS ( https: 
//github.com/ANTsX/ANTs  ), running  an iterative  registration  proce- 
dure based on the FA and L0 images,  using the b-spline  SyN transfor-  
mation,  and cross correlation  as a cost function.  The data of the other 
sites were transformed  to RISH features  and transformed  to the com- 
mon space to derive the average  scale maps needed  to remove  site ef- 
fects. The scaling maps were back-projected  to the individual  space of 
each subject and used to harmonize  its dMRI data. The dMRI data of 
S1 were also transformed  to RISH features  but without  any scaling of 
the RISH features.  This step was performed  to ensure consistency  be- 
tween harmonized  and not harmonized  data, given that the spherical  
decomposition  might remove  signal components  in higher order than L4 
or L6. 
The training  of the harmonization  between  S1 and S2 was performed  
using TP1 and TP2 of a subgroup  of age-matched  subjects  for both sites 
(14 unique subjects  at TP1 + 1 repeated  scan at TP2 for a total of 15 
datasets  for both sites). For the harmonization  of S3, the same subjects  
from S1 were used as reference.  Due to the lower number  of partici-  
pants available  at this site, scans obtained  at multiple  TPs at S3 were 
used for training  harmonization.  The training  set of S3 consisted  of 11 
datasets  from 7 unique subjects.  Subsequently,  the DKI model was ﬁt 
to the data before and after harmonization  using FSL DTIFIT and the 
ordinary  least squares  approach.  This resulted  in FA and MD maps, cor- 
rected for Kurtosis  eﬀects, and MK maps. Physiologically  implausible  
MK values, i.e. MK < 0 or MK < 3 were set to 0. To derive NODDI  met- 
rics, we employed  the “microstructure  diﬀusion  toolbox  ”( Harms,  2017 )

( Nosek et al., 2018 ). The document  is time-stamped  and any changes  
made thereafter  are documented  for transparency.  Preregistrations  are 
instrumental  to avoid confusion  of a priori and a posteriori  deﬁnition  of 
hypotheses  and analysis  methods,  which can easily lead to ﬂawed inter- 
pretation  of a p-value  from a statistical  result and can create overcon-  
ﬁdence  in ﬁndings  ( Gelman  and Loken, 2014 ; Ioannidis,  2005 ; Munafò
et al., 2017 ). In face of high ﬂexibility  in preprocessing  and analysis  
methods  ( Botvinik-Nezer  et al., 2020 ; Carp, 2012b ), preregistration  can 
dramatically  enhance  the transparency  of a neuroimaging  project.  More 
than in basic science,  it is mandatory  to register  clinical  trials in a pub- 
lic registry  before data acquisition,  in order to publish  in a renowned  
biomedical  journal.  In practice,  leading  clinical  registries  leave it at the 
discretion  of the researcher  as to how much detail they use to describe  
the analytic  strategy  for processing  their neuroimaging  data. One may 
register  a neuroimaging  endpoint  in some way similar to “higher  BOLD 
response  in ROI (Region-of-Interest)  X for the contrast  of conditions  A vs. 
B ”. There are many possible  analysis  strategies  to assess this endpoint;  
the search space for signiﬁcant  voxels could be extended  to the whole- 
brain or reduced  to a small volume  deﬁned  by a ROI mask, the mask 
could be anatomically  or functionally  deﬁned,  and so on. For a conﬁr- 
matory  hypothesis  test, the complete  analysis  plan should be deﬁned  a 
priori ( Gentili et al., 2021 ; Poldrack  et al., 2017 ), but this is hardly the 
case in clinical  trials with neuroimaging  endpoints.  
A growing  literature  is providing  tools and guidelines  to facilitate  
reproducible  neuroimaging  ﬁndings  and data sharing  ( Esteban  et al., 
2019 ; Gorgolewski  et al., 2017 ; Laird, 2021 ; Nichols  et al., 2017 ; 
Poldrack  et al., 2017 ). Standards  such as BIDS, which was introduced  
by Gorgolewski  et al. (2016) , present  a well-documented  scheme  to 
structure  data ﬁles in directories,  provide  agreed upon terminology  for 
naming  these ﬁles, and explain  how metadata  should be reported.  The 
sharing  of primary  research  data is critical for a reproducible  science  
and can save resources,  as existing  data can be re-used  and aggregated  
with other data sets for future research  projects.  Still, researchers  of- 
ten eschew  data sharing,  e.g. because  of a lack of incentives,  the fear 
of misuse,  and legal issues such as data protection  and privacy  issues 
( Houtkoop  et al., 2018 ; Sayogo  and Pardo, 2013 ; Schmidt  et al., 2016 ; 
Tenopir  et al., 2011 ; White et al., 2020 ). In this respect,  it is of interest  
how the General  Data Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  which came into 
force in the European  Union (EU) May, 2018, may aﬀect the preference  
to share data among researchers.  Hence, diﬀerences  were explored  be- 
tween researchers  who indicated  residency  inside vs. outside  the EU. 
Moreover,  the more complex  the dataset,  the more resources  may be re- 
quired to prepare  a sharable  dataset,  thus taking up time that could be 
used to do new experiments  ( Poline et al., 2012 ). Where scientist  prac- 
titioners  must balance  research  and clinical  work and where data are 
collected  from vulnerable  patient populations,  the situation  can be even 
more fraught.  Therefore,  we conducted  exploratory  analyses  of diﬀer- 
ences between  researchers  who indicated  an aﬃliation  with a medical  
faculty vs. a diﬀerent,  non-medical  faculty.  Data and materials  from this 
research  are available  online 1 ( Paret et al., 2022 ).

magnetic  resonance  imaging  ”O R “functional  Magnetic  Resonance

dresses from corresponding  authors  of scientiﬁc  articles  published  
1 https://github.com/christianparet/Survey-  on- Open- Science-  Practices-  in- 
Functional-  Neuroimaging.-  Dataset-  and- Materials  . 
2 Practically,  we did four searches,  each covering  a period of two or more 
years (i.e., 2010-2012,  2013-2014,  2015-2016,  2017-today),  to limit the total 
number of exported  entries per search.

sults were exported  to text ﬁles, which were further processed  with 
an online app to remove  duplicates  and to extract email addresses  
( https://www.convertcsv.com/email-extractor.htm  ). An email was sent 
to 14,690 addresses  on 2020 Dec 1, with an invitation  to participate,  in- 
cluding  a personalized  link to the survey.  If the recipients  did not click 
the link or did not complete  the survey after 14 days, they received  
a single reminder  email. Figure 1 illustrates  the recruitment  approach.  
From 342 persons  who clicked the invitation  link, 82.75%  completed  
the questionnaire  and were included  in analysis,  corresponding  to an 
overall response  rate of 2.42 % and resulting  in N = 283 participants  to-

( Haak et al., 2013 ). CF modeling  allows characterizing  the cortical  re- 
sponse properties  of a population  of neurons  in terms of the activity  in 
another  region of the visual cortex. In essence,  it translates  the concept  
of the stimulus-referred  receptive  ﬁeld (RF) into the domain  of connec-  
tivity by assessing  the spatial dependency  between  signals in distinct  
cortical  visual ﬁeld areas ( Haak et al., 2013 ). This neural-referred  RF is 
also known as the cortico-cortical  population  RF (cc-pRF).  The CF ap- 
proach can be used to assess the spatial integration  properties  of the 
visual system from either task-evoked  or resting-state  neural responses  
( Gravel et al., 2014 ; Bock et al., 2015 ). So far, it has been mainly used 
to study connective  plasticity  in various  ophthalmic  and neurological  
diseases  ( Haak et al., 2013 ; Halbertsma  et al., 2019 ; Haak et al., 2016 ; 
Ahmadi  et al., 2019 ; Carvalho  et al., 2019 ; De Best et al., 2019 ). 
The standard  CF (sCF) approach  has some intrinsic  properties  which 
limit its use in a variety of potential  applications.  These limitations  are 
due to the fact that the optimal  model ﬁt is obtained  by minimizing  
the diﬀerence  between  the prediction  and measured  signal on the basis 
of minimizing  the residual  sum of squares  (RSS). Consequently,  model 
comparison  is only possible  based on the percentage  of explained  vari- 
ance of the model and there is no information  to quantify  the variabil-  
ity and reliability  of the various  estimated  CF parameters.  If we could 
retrieve  the latter type of information,  CF modelling  would lend itself 
much better for statistical  comparisons  at the level of single individu-  
als, which can be important  in the context  of patient studies,  e.g. with 
a neurodegenerative  disorder,  such as glaucoma.  This would be essen- 
tial when assessing  rare cases, where group averages  are not available.  
Moreover,  it would become  possible  to evaluate  the probability  distri- 
bution of CF models at the level of single voxels. This may help to un- 
ravel the detailed  neurobiology  of the visual cortex by testing alternative  
models to explain  task or resting-state  related responses  (e.g. compar-  
ing diﬀerent  receptive  ﬁeld shapes while taking model complexity  into 
account).  
The present  limitations  of the CF modeling  approach  may be over- 
come by determining  the full underlying  probability  distributions  for 
the various  CF parameters.  From these, we can quantify,  at the voxel 
level, the uncertainty  associated  with each parameter  estimate.  Theo- 
retically,  uncertainty  is a useful evaluation  parameter  by itself. First of 
all, it can establish  conﬁdence  in the CF model predictions.  Secondly,  
it may be valuable  for investigating  and meaningfully  explaining  diﬀer- 
ences within parameter  distributions  as a result of diﬀerent  conditions,  
tasks, interventions  or pathology.  Finally,  it may be used to identify  
model biases that, for example,  result from over- or under-ﬁtting  or a 
co-dependence  of parameters.  Removing  such dependencies  may help 
to further improve  the CF model predictions.  
To enable this new functionality,  we present  a Bayesian  infer- 
ence framework  for CF modelling,  which we will refer to with bCF. 
Using a Markov  Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  procedure  ( Robert and 
Casella,  2011 ), bCF provides  the underlying  posterior  probability  dis- 
tribution  of the CF parameters  (position  and size in case of the most 
basic model).  From this distribution,  we can derive the uncertainty  as- 
sociated  with each of these parameters.  In addition,  we also retain the 
eﬀect size of the CF model, which we will refer to as beta (adhering  to 
the nomenclature  used by Zeidman  et al. (2018) . We show how beta can 
be used as a data-driven  threshold.  To further illustrate  the functional-  
ity gained by bCF we show that, at the voxel level, single Gaussian  (SG) 
models are favoured  over Diﬀerence-of-Gaussian  (DoG) models.  
2. Methods  
2.1. Participants  
Twelve  healthy  female participants  (mean age 22 years, s.d. = 1.8 
years) with normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and without  a his- 
tory of neurological  disease  were included.  Previously,  these data 
have been used as a normative  dataset in work that did not use our 
present  framework  ( Halbertsma  et al., 2019 ). Anonymized  and prepro-  cessed time series for each visual area can be downloaded  at this link: 
http://www.visualneuroscience.nl/cf  . 
The ethics board of the University  Medical  Center Groningen  
(UMCG)  approved  the study protocol.  All participants  provided  writ- 
ten informed  consent.  The study followed  the tenets of the Declaration  
of Helsinki.  
2.2. Stimuli presentation  and description  
The visual stimuli were displayed  on a MR compatible  screen located  
at the head-end  of the MRI scanner  with a viewing  distance  of 118 cm. 
The participants  viewed  the complete  screen through  a mirror placed at 
11 cm from the eyes and supported  by the 32-channel  SENSE head coil. 
Screen size was 36 ×23°of visual angle and the distance  from the partic- 
ipant’s eyes to the screen was approximately  75 cm. Stimuli  were gener- 
ated and displayed  using the Psychtoolbox  ( http://psychtoolbox.org/  ) 
and VISTADISP  toolbox  (VISTA  Lab, Stanford  University),  which are 
both MatLab  based ( Brainard,  1997 ; Pelli, 1997 ). The stimulus  consisted  
of drifting  bar apertures  (of 10.2°radius)  with a high contrast  checker-  
board texture on a grey (mean luminance)  background.  A sequence  of 
eight diﬀerent  bar apertures  with four diﬀerent  bar orientations  (hori- 
zontal, vertical  and diagonal  orientations),  two opposite  motion direc- 
tions and four periods  of mean-luminance  presentations  comprised  the 
stimulus  presentation  that lasted 192 s. To maintain  stable ﬁxation,  par- 
ticipants  were instructed  to focus on a small colored  dot present  in the 
center of the screen and press a button as soon as the dot changed  color. 
The complete  visual ﬁeld mapping  paradigm  was presented  to the par- 
ticipant  six times, with a new scan started for each repetition.

Nummenmaa  et al., 2020 ) and elevated  D 2 R expression  is observed  in 
motivational  disturbance  ( Simpson  et al., 2014 ) and possibly  in depres-  
sion, although  the elevated  D 2 R has been shown particularly  in med- 
icated ( D’haenen  and Bossuyt,  1994 ) rather than unmedicated  depres-  
sion ( Hirvonen  et al., 2008 ), possibly  reﬂecting  antidepressant  treat- 
ment ( Hirvonen  et al., 2008 ). Conversely,  Parkinson’s  disease  is asso- 
ciated with lowered  D 2 R expression  ( Leggio et al., 2016 ), at least after 
the early disorder  stage when increase  of D 2 Rs may occur as a com- 
pensation  to nerve terminal  loss or medical  treatment  ( Kaasinen  et al., 
2021 , Seeman  and Niznik,  1990 ). In addition  to this neurodegenerative  
disease  ( Leggio et al., 2016 , Elbaz et al., 2016 ), drug abuse is also asso- 
ciated with striatal D 2 R loss, and the lower D 2 R density  may constitute  
a vulnerability  factor for drug abuse ( Volkow  et al., 2003 , Volkow  et al., 
2009 ). 
To understand  dopaminergic  dysfunction  and related pathophysiol-  
ogy, factors contributing  to dopamine  function  in the healthy  population  
need to be identiﬁed.  Small-scale  PET studies suggest  that subject demo- 
graphics,  such as age ( Antonini  et al., 1993 , Kim et al., 2011 , Dang et al., 
2016 ), sex ( Pohjalainen  et al., 1998 , Fazio et al., 2017 ) and body mass 
index (BMI) ( Dang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2001 , but see Karlsson  
et al., 2015 ) might aﬀect the D 2 R availability  in striatum.  However,  
there has been increasing  concern  over the lack of replicability  of neu- 
roimaging  ﬁndings  ( Poldrack  et al., 2017 ). Insuﬃcient  statistical  power 
( Poldrack  et al., 2017 , Button et al., 2013 ), variable  methods  for ana- 
lyzing data ( Simmons  et al., 2011 ), as well as failure to appropriately  
control for multiple  comparisons  ( Eklund et al., 2016 ) have been pro- 
posed as main sources  of the poor replicability.  
Because  PET imaging  is expensive,  data pooling  has recently  
emerged  as an eﬀective  way of increasing  sample sizes and conse- 
quently  providing  more accurate  statistical  estimates  ( Kantonen  et al., 
2020 ). Additionally,  Bayesian  hierarchical  modeling  has been proposed  
to facilitate  reproducible  science  by limiting  the “researcher  degrees  
of freedom  ”i n the analysis  phase ( Lindquist  and Gelman,  2009 ) and 
by removing  the need for arbitrary  multiple  comparison  correction  
methods  ( Gelman  et al., 2012 ). The primary  aim of this study was to 
address  the eﬀects of age, sex, BMI, and hemisphere  on D 2 R avail- 
ability using a well-powered  dataset of historical  scans. Using hier- 
archical  Bayesian  modeling,  we were able to address  the potential  
hierarchical  nature of the eﬀects and diﬀerences  arising from dif- 
ferent PET scanners.  We analyzed  a large dataset of 156 historical  
controls  scanned  with [11C]raclopride,  a selective  D 2 R antagonist.  
We also replicated  the results in an independent  sample of 135 sub- 
jects. Our secondary  goal was development  of age and sex-speciﬁc  
atlases of D 2 R availability  in the brain that would be released  to 
the neuroimaging  community  via NeuroVault  (https://neurovault.org;  
https://identiﬁers.org/neurovault.collection:12099).  
2. Methods  and materials  
2.1. Subjects  
The data were 156 baseline  [11C]raclopride  scans of healthy  con- 
trol subjects  (sex 120 males and 36 females;  age 19-71 years, BMI range 
18-38, no information  about the menstrual  cycle) scanned  at Turku PET 
Centre between  2004 and 2018. Detailed  sample information  is shown 
in Table 1 (see also Table S6 for exclusion  criteria).  Studies  were in- 
cluded in the analysis  if they were baseline  scans with injected  dose > 
100 megabecquerel  (MBq) to avoid low signal-noise  ratio (SNR) (see 
Table S7 for radiochemical  details)  and the magnetic  resonance  (MR) 
scan and basic demographic  and anthropometric  information  (height,  
weight)  was available.  If multiple  baseline  scans were acquired  for an 
individual,  chronologically  ﬁrst scan was included  in the analysis.  The 
data were compiled  across 5 diﬀerent  PET scanners  (see Supplemen-  
tary Material  section Scanner  Considerations  for detailed  information).  
Finnish  legislation  does not require  ethical approval  for register-based  
studies.  Table 1

2.2. PET data acquisition  and image processing  
Antagonist  radioligand  [11C]raclopride  binds to D 2 Rs ( Farde et al., 
1985 , Farde et al., 1989 , Mishra et al., 2018 ), allowing  reliable  quan- 
tiﬁcation  of striatal and thalamic  D 2 R availability  ( Mishra et al., 
2018 , Hirvonen  et al., 2003 , Ginovart,  2005 , Cárdenas  et al., 2004 , 
Innis et al., 2007 , Alakurtti  et al., 2015 ). However,  the reliability  of 
thalamic  measures  using [11C]raclopride  is not as robust as in the 
striatum  ( Freiburghaus  et al., 2021 ), and its binding  in extrastriatal  re- 
gions, such as the cerebral  cortex, is unspeciﬁc  ( Hirvonen  et al., 2003 , 
Freiburghaus  et al., 2021 , Svensson  et al., 2019 , but see Alakurtti  et al., 
2015 , Papenberg  et al., 2019 ). In this study, we included  the following  
four regions  of interest  (ROIs): striatal nucleus  accumbens  (accumbens),  
caudate  nucleus  (caudate),  putamen,  as well as thalamus  close by the 
striatal ROIs. The PET data was acquired  using ﬁve diﬀerent  scanners  
(Scanner  Considerations  including  Table S1 in SM). 
Preprocessing  and kinetic modeling  were done using Magia toolbox  
( Karjalainen  et al., 2020 ). Preprocessing  consisted  of framewise  realign-  
ment and co-registration  of the PET and MR images.  Tracer binding  
was quantiﬁed  using the outcome  measure  binding  potential  (BP ND ), 
which is the ratio of speciﬁc  binding  to non-displaceable  binding  in tis- 
sue ( Innis et al., 2007 ). BP ND was estimated  using a simpliﬁed  reference  
tissue model (SRTM)  ( Lammertsma  and Hume, 1996 ) with cerebellar  
gray matter as the reference  region ( Hall et al., 1996 ). Acquisition  length 
was harmonized  by including  ﬁrst 52 minutes  from each scan. Previous  
studies have shown that 52 minutes  provides  suﬃcient  reproducibility  
and reliability  for modeling  striatal [11C]raclopride  binding  with SRTM 
( Hirvonen  et al., 2003 ). We thus used this cut-oﬀfor  all the studies as it 
allowed  us to apply it as a standard  way to calculate  the BP ND estimates  
for the dataset while harmonizing  the scan times across protocols.  
Individual  frames were ﬁrst realigned  to account  for between-frame  
movements.  The ﬁrst frame was omitted  because  it did not contain  suf- 
ﬁcient signal for every subject.  T1-weighted  MR images were processed  
using FreeSurfer  (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  The MR im- 
ages were then co-registered  with the PET data for region of interest  
extraction.
