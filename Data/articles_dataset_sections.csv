10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119295,"Introduction  
Real-time  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (RT-fMRI)  is an 
emerging  technology  that holds tremendous  promise  for breakthroughs  
in basic science  and clinical  applications.  In contrast  to traditional,  of- 
ﬂine fMRI analysis,  RT-fMRI  involves  analyzing  data while participants  
are still in the scanner,  giving experimenters  the ability to modify the 
stimuli or tasks that they present  as a function  of the participant’s  mea- 
sured neural state. RT-fMRI  can be used in neurofeedback  designs,  in 
which participants  are given feedback  on how well they are instantiat-  
ing a target brain state, and they use this information  to learn how to 
better instantiate  that state (for a historical  review of fMRI neurofeed-  
back, see Linden et al., 2021 ; this review is part of a recent textbook  
on fMRI neurofeedback  edited by Hampson,  2021 ). In another  use of 
RT-fMRI,  stimuli are modiﬁed  as a function  of brain activation,  but par-

E-mail address: knorman@princeton.edu  (K.A. Norman)  . ticipants  are not explicitly  given the goal of maximizing  the goodness  of 
their brain state; for example,  in a triggering  design, the results of the 
fMRI analysis  are used to determine  when stimuli are presented  (e.g., 
Yoo et al., 2012 ). RT-fMRI  reverses  the typical logic of fMRI –instead  of 
viewing  the fMRI measurements  as a dependent  variable  (i.e., looking  at 
the eﬀects of a task manipulation  on fMRI), the fMRI measurements  can 
be viewed  as the independent  variable  (i.e., you can look at the eﬀect of 
instantiating  a particular  neural pattern  on other behavioral  and neural 
measurements;  Turk-Browne,  2021 ). 
Previous  RT-fMRI  studies have led to a wide range of interesting  dis- 
coveries  in healthy  participants.  For instance,  participants  given neu- 
rofeedback  from the ventral tegmental  area (VTA) while they thought  
about personalized  motivational  states were able to learn to upregulate  
VTA activity;  this increase  in the ability to upregulate  VTA activity  per- 
sisted after the end of neurofeedback  training  ( MacInnes  et al., 2016 ).

Experiments  were performed  on a 7-Tesla  306-mm  horizontal  bore 
magnet  (BioSpec  70/30 USR, Bruker,  Ettlingen,  Germany)  with Avance  
III HD electronics  and ParaVision  6.0.1 console  software.  The system 
was equipped  with a BGA-20S  water-cooled  gradient  system with 200.5 
mm inner diameter,  300 mT/m maximum  amplitude,  and 1000 T/m/s 
maximum  slew rate. The instrument  was equipped  with four CryoProbes  
suitable  for mouse head imaging  (RF CP F2.5 300 1H 56/20, Bruker,  
Ettlingen,  Germany).  Each probe consists  of a double-loop  surface coil 
mounted  on a 20-mm inner diameter  half-shell  (superior  to the mouse’s  
head) and operated  in quadrature  as a two-channel  array in trans- 
mit/receive  mode. The spectrometer  electronics  are equipped  with two 
transmit  and 16 receive  channels  (8 of which are required  for operation  
of the CryoProbes).  For the data in this paper, the four coils (with two 
channels  each) were connected  to eight independent  receivers  and to a 
single radiofrequency  transmit  channel  and ampliﬁer  through  an 8-way 
splitter (with appropriate  phase shifts for quadrature  operation  of each 
probe).

sources  tab ”at https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/ﬁeld.cgi?id  = 200 ). 
The UK Biobank  received  ethical approval  from the Research  Ethics 
Committee  (reference  11/NW/0382)  and the present  study was con- 
ducted under application  46 007. 
The neuroimaging  phenotypes  in this study correspond  to volumes,  
mean thicknesses,  surface areas from the ﬁrst imaging  visit (Instance  
2) and were generated  by an image-processing  pipeline  developed  and 
run by the UK Biobank  Imaging  team ( Alfaro-Almagro  et al., 2018 ; 
Miller et al., 2016 ). 
2.1.1. Brain image acquisition  and processing  
A standard  Siemens  Skyra 3T running  VD13A  SP4 with a standard  
Siemens  32-channel  RF receive  head coil was used to collect data ( Brain 
Scan Protocol  ). The 3D MPRAGE  T1-weighted  volumes  were analyzed  
by the UK Biobank  Imaging  team with pipeline  scripts that primarily  
call for FSL and Freesurfer  tools. Details of the acquisition  protocols,  
image processing  pipeline,  image data ﬁles, and derived  measures  of 
brain structure  and function  are available  in the UK Biobank  Imaging  
Protocols  . 
2.1.2. Total brain volume (TBV) 
TBV was calculated  as the sum of the following  ASEG segmentation:  
Cerebellum  GMV (Left: 26,557,  Right: 26,588),  Cerebral  GMV (Left: 
26,552,  Right: 26,583),  Cerebellum  WMV (Left: 26,556,  Right: 26,587),  
Cerebral  WMV (Left: 26,553,  Right: 26,584),  and the total subcortical  
volume  we calculated  with the ASEG and Freesurfer  subﬁelds.  Refer to 
Supplemental  Section  1 for details on the choice of TBV. We excluded  
individuals  with missing  data in these regions,  yielding  40 055 partici-  
pants. 
2.1.3. Scanner  site 
The age and sex of participants  diﬀered  across the 3 scanner  sites 
located  in Cheadle  (Site 11,025),  Reading  (Site 11,026),  and Newcastle  
(Site 11,027;  Supplemental  Section  2). One individual  without  scanner  
site location  was removed  from the analyses,  yielding  40 054 partici-  
pants. 
2.1.4. Sex 
Participants  who did not self-report  as male or female or whose self- 
reported  sex and genetic  sex diﬀered  were also excluded  from the anal- 
yses ( N = 26). When genetic  sex was not available,  reported  sex was 
used to deﬁne the sex of the participant.  Of the 40 028 participants  in- 
cluded in the analyses,  there were more females  ( N = 21 142) than males 
( N = 18 886, 𝜒2 (1) = 127.15,  p < 2.2e-16).  
2.1.5. Age 
To obtain a continuous  measure  of age, age was calculated  based on 
the year and month of birth of the participant  and the day, month,  and 
year of their MRI visit. The mean age was 64.13 years old ( SD = 7.54). 
Males ( M = 64.81 years, SD = 7.64) were older than females  ( M = 63.51 
years, SD = 7.39, t (39,186) = 17.17, p < 2.2e-16).  
2.1.6. Handedness  
Handedness  was measured  with a multiple-choice  self-report  ques- 
tion ""Are you right or left-handed?""  (data ﬁeld 1707). The age and sex of 
participants  diﬀered  between  Right-handed  ( N = 35,596),  Left-handed  
2  C.M. Williams,  H. Peyre, R. Toro et al. NeuroImage  254 (2022) 119118 
( N = 3711), and ambidextrous  ( N = 547) individuals  (Supplemental  Sec-

Participants  included  children  and adolescents  aged 8 to 16 who 
were recruited  through  elementary  and secondary  schools  as part of the 
Brock Healthy  Youth Project (BHYP).  Parents  identiﬁed  whether  their 
child had any illnesses  or disabilities  (either physical  or mental).  Two 
participants  were excluded  because  of a diagnosis  of autism,  one partic- 
ipant was excluded  because  of a history of seizures,  and one participant  
was excluded  because  of a diagnosis  of cerebral  palsy. The ﬁnal sample 
included  467 participants  who were recruited  for the ﬁrst wave of data 
collection  and completed  the EEG session.  Participants  were excluded  
from the analyses  due to recording  issues with or excessive  artifact  iden- 
tiﬁed during pre-processing  ( n = 33 for GO trials, n = 30 NOGO trials). 
Additional  participants  were removed  due to extreme  values for theta 
power ( n = 2 for GO trials, n = 5 for NOGO trials). The ﬁnal sample re- 
sulted in 432 participants  (224 females,  208 males - See Supplementary

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119649,"2.1. Governing  equations  of the brain bioelectric  activity at scales as 
measured  by iEEG and MRI 
The intracranial  electroencephalography  (iEEG) forward  problem  in- 
volves predicting  the electric  potential  within the brain and at the im- 
planted  electrodes  given a predeﬁned  source. The relevant  frequency  
spectrum  in iEEG is typically  below 1 kHz, with most studies dealing  
with frequencies  between  0.1 and 100 Hz ( Baillet et al., 2001; Brette 
and Destexhe,  2012 ). Therefore,  the physics  of iEEG can be approxi-  
mated by Poisson’s  equation,  which is the quasi-static  approximation  
of Maxwell’s  equations.  For a spatial domain  Ω∈ℝ 3 with boundary  
𝜕Ω= Γ𝐷 ∪Γ𝑁 and outward  unit normal  𝒏 , Poisson’s  equation  for the 
iEEG forward  problem  can be written  as follows:  
−∇ ⋅( 𝐶(∇ 𝑢 )) = 𝑓 in Ω, (1) 
𝒏 ⋅( 𝐶(∇ 𝑢 )) = 𝑔 on Γ𝑁 , (2) 
𝑢 = ℎ on Γ𝐷 , (3) 
where 𝑢 is the unknown  scalar potential  and 𝐶is the (symmetric  positive  
semi-deﬁnite)  conductivity  tensor. The low conductivity  of air outside  
the scalp ( 𝐶 = 0 for all 𝑥 ∉̄Ω) implies  that a zero-ﬂux  Neumann  bound- 
ary condition  𝑔 = 0 can be applied  on the surface Γ𝑁 . Dirichlet  boundary  
conditions  ℎ on the surface Γ𝐷 are typically  applied  by setting the poten- 
tial to zero at a node corresponding  to a reference  electrode.  Loading  can 
be applied  to the model either by prescribing  the potential  𝑢 at certain 
nodes or by applying  a current  source 𝑓 = ∇ ⋅𝒋 , with 𝒋 being a dipole 
source vector. The epileptic  seizure onset source is typically  modeled  as 
a current  dipole ( Hallez et al., 2007 ). 
Electromagnetic  source localization  employs  a linear model, known 
as the lead ﬁeld matrix,  which relates the measured  electrode  voltages  
to the cerebral  current  sources  that generated  them ( Rush and Driscoll,  
1969; Weinstein  et al., 2000 ). The lead ﬁeld matrix can be computed  
using Helmholtz’s  principle  of reciprocity,  which relates the potential  
3  B.F. Zwick, G.C. Bourantas,  S. Safdar et al. NeuroImage  263 (2022) 119649 
diﬀerence  between  two points 𝐴 and 𝐵caused by a given dipole 𝒑 , to 
the electric  ﬁeld 𝑬 = −∇ 𝑢 at the dipole location  resulting  from a current  
𝐼placed between  𝐴 and 𝐵( Plonsey,  1963; Weinstein  et al., 2000 ): 
𝑬 ⋅𝒑 
− 𝐼 = 𝑢 𝐴 − 𝑢 𝐵 . (4) 
The lead ﬁeld matrix can be constructed  by placing  a source and sink at 
pairs of electrodes,  and computing  for each of these pairs the resulting  
electric  ﬁeld in all of the elements.  The reciprocity  principle  can then 
be applied  to reconstruct  the potential  diﬀerences  at the electrodes  for 
a source placed in any element  ( Weinstein  et al., 2000 ). 
Computation  of the lead ﬁeld matrix requires  the solution  of the for- 
ward problem  for each sensor and ground  electrode  pair. To compute  the 
lead ﬁeld matrix,  one electrode  is selected  arbitrarily  as the ground  (or 
reference)  electrode.  For each lead ﬁeld (row in the lead ﬁeld matrix),  
a unit current  is applied  to one of the sensor (non-ground)  electrodes.  
The electric  ﬁeld in each element  is computed  as the gradient  of the 
electric  potential  and represents  a row in the matrix.  The potential  at 
the ( 𝑀 − 1) non-ground  electrodes  for a source located  in any of the 𝑁
elements  is given by 
𝒖 = 𝑳 𝒋 , (5) 
where 𝑳 , of dimension  ( 𝑀 − 1) ×3 𝑁, is the lead ﬁeld matrix,  and 𝒋 , of 
dimension  3 𝑁 ×1 , is a vector of dipole amplitudes  in all points of the 
source space. 
Although  the iEEG forward  problem  is linear, it is diﬃcult  to solve 
due to signiﬁcant  diﬃculties  in creating  a patient-speciﬁc  domain  Ω
on which the Eqs. (1) –(3) are to be solved and patient-speciﬁc  spatial 
distribution  of anisotropic  conductivity  tensor 𝐶, addressed  below.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(19995, 20000), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3819, 3825), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119559,"2.1. OPM Instrumentation  
Each FieldLine  (Boulder,  CO) v2 OPM sensor is comprised  of a 3 ×3 
mm 3 cell containing  87 Rb vapor, a heater, laser diode, photodiode,  op- 
tical components,  and three internal  orthogonal  ﬁeld coils within a 
13 ×15 ×30 mm 3 housing.  A shielded  ribbon cable connects  each sen- 
sor to the multichannel  control electronics.  The cable provides  power for 
the laser, photodiode,  and heater, signals from the photodiode  and ﬁeld 
nulling coils, plus modulation  and feedback  signals.  The cable connector  
to the OPM control electronics  contains  an EPROM  (erasable  program-  
able read-only  memory)  with embedded  tuning parameters  for plug- 
and-play  operation.  FieldLine’s  sensor design reduces  heat exposure  of 
the laser to the hot vapor cell ensuring  that the laser can be reliably  sta- 
bilized to the atomic transition.  In addition,  the OPM controller  incorpo-  
rates algorithms  for rapid and reliable  ambient  ﬁeld nulling in non-ideal  
magnetic  environments  in MSRs with high oﬀset ﬁelds and large power 
line frequency  interference.  Each sensor can be operated  in closed-loop  
mode on its sensing  z-axis using a self-shielded  double Helmholtz  coil 
designed  to reduce crosstalk  ( Nardelli  et al., 2019 ). The sensor axes are 
established  by the laser path and modulation  coils ( Figure 1 A). These 
axes are labelled  b X , b Y , and b Z , with modulation  applied  to b Z making  
it the sensing  axis; b X and b Y are the transverse  axes ( Figure 1 B). The 
x and y-axis ﬁeld coils are higher-order  Helmholtz-like  designs  and are 
used for statically  nulling the transverse  ﬁeld. The multichannel  OPM 
control electronics  chassis accommodates  up to 16 sensors  and one A/D 
(analog-to-digital)  channel.  Multiple  chassis can be daisy-chained  and 
synchronized  to accommodate  up to 512 sensors.  All functions,  includ-

are determined  by the path of the laser beam through  the rubidium  vapor cell

orthogonal  to these forming  a right-handed  coordinate  system The transverse  
axes, (b X ) and (b Y ) also have pairs of coils (not shown) for nulling the ﬁeld. 
The rubidium  cell is oﬀset 5 mm from the base of the sensor housing.  (B) The 
independent  coordinate  system of each sensor is indicated  relative to the ribbon 
cable orientation,  with positive b X directed  toward the cable. (C) The orienta- 
tion of the 3D-printed  sensor ﬁxture is deﬁned by the vectors I, J, and K of the 
reference  OPM array. These axes are aligned with each reference  OPM sensing 
vector (b Z ). 
ing data acquisition,  modulation,  detection,  ﬁeld nulling,  and closed- 
loop feedback  are controlled  internally  by an FPGA (ﬁeld-programmable  
gate array) and onboard  host CPU (central  processing  unit). An Ether- 
net cable provides  communication  for data and commands  between  the 
controller  and a Linux or PC workstation.  Control  functions  are com- 
manded  using a set of Python APIs. FieldLine  OPM sensors  have a nom- 
inal sensitivity  ∼15 fT/ √
Hz and may be operated  in either open-loop  
or closed-loop  mode. In open-loop  mode the sensor response  is -3dB at 
150 Hz. The closed-loop  bandwidth,  selected  by FieldLine,  represents  a 
trade-oﬀ with  sensitivity.  In practice,  the bandwidth  is established  by 
adapting  the coeﬃcients  of a closed-loop  proportional  integral  device 
(PID) controller  to ﬂatten the frequency  response.  These coeﬃcients  are 
computed  adaptively  once and are stored for each individual  sensor. In 
closed-loop  mode both amplitude  and phase response  are equal for all 
sensors.  The sensor operating  range is ± 100 nT, with a closed-loop  dy- 
namic range of ± 15 nT. The standoﬀ of  the FieldLine  sensor is 5 mm, 
meaning  that the center of the 87 Rb cell is oﬀset 5 mm from the base of 
the sensor housing.  
The D/A (digital-to-analog)  converters  on the FieldLine  controller  
supply the currents  applied  to the three orthogonal  ﬁeld coils of each 
OPM. In normal  operation,  the controller  applies static currents  to null 
the ﬁeld for each axis using a zeroing  algorithm  executed  before the 
start of data acquisition.  In open-loop  mode, all three nulling coil cur- 
rents remain ﬁxed throughout  operation.  In closed-loop  mode, the con- 
troller applies a time-varying  current  to the sensing  axis ( b Z ) to dynam-  
ically maintain  null ﬁeld, making  the measurement  proportional  to the 
applied  feedback  current,  while the transverse  axis nulling coils remain 
static. This leaves the OPM sensor susceptible  to CAPE errors due to am- 
bient transverse  ﬂuctuating  ﬁelds. While time-varying  modiﬁcations  to 
the transverse  axis nulling coils are not currently  implemented  as stan- 
dard operation  of FieldLine  sensors,  the sensor controller  architecture  uniquely  permits  dynamic  control of the transverse  ( b X and b Y ) ﬁeld 
coils, enabling  the implementation  of DFC for mitigation  of CAPE.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(13051, 13056), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5278, 5284), match='\n2.2. '>"

Three adult male squirrel  monkeys  ( Saimiri sciureus  ) (SM-H, SM-G, 
and SM-S) were studied.  Data from four imaging  sessions  were included  
in the quantiﬁcation  (one animal underwent  two sessions).  For the fMRI 
experiments,  animals  were initially  sedated  with ketamine  hydrochlo-  
ride (10 mg/kg,  im) and given atropine  sulfate (0.05 mg/kg,  im), and 
then anesthetized  with isoﬂurane  (0.7% − 1.2%) delivered  in a 70:30 
N 2 O/O 2 mixture.  After intubation,  the animal was placed in a custom-  
designed  MR cradle with the head secured  in a plastic stereotaxic  frame 
with two plastic ear bars and one head bar. During fMRI data acqui- 
sition, animals  were maintained  at a light (0.7–0.9%  isoﬂurane)  and 
stable level of anesthesia.  2.5% dextrose  in saline solution  was infused  
intravenously  (3 ml/kg/h)  to prevent  dehydration.  Animals  were artiﬁ- 
cially ventilated  to maintain  an end-tidal  CO 2 of 4%. Rectal temperature  
was maintained  (SA Instruments)  between  37.5 °C and 38.5 °C using a 
circulating  water blanket.  Heart rate (EKG, SA instruments),  peripheral  
capillary  oxygen  saturation  (SpO 2 ; Nonin),  respiration  pattern,  and end- 
tidal CO 2 (22–26 mmHg;  SurgiVet)  were continuously  monitored  during 
the entire procedure.  During fMRI data acquisition,  the heart rate was 
stable, with changes  of ⟨10 bpm during stimulation.  SpO 2 was also sta- 
ble, remaining  at ⟩95% during the entire experiment.  All procedures  
were conducted  by following  National  Institutes  of Health and ARRIVE

Twenty-six  healthy  male participants  were enrolled  in this study. 
The general  procedure  was approved  by the Ethics Committee  of the 
Medical  Association  Hamburg  and carried out in accordance  with the latest version  of the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Written  informed  consent  
was obtained  from all participants  after the nature of the procedures  had 
been fully explained.  One participant  dropped  out due to adverse  eﬀects 
caused by S-ketamine  (dissociative  eﬀect/headache).  Another  partici-  
pant had to be excluded  due to poor EEG data quality.  Accordingly,  we 
included  24 healthy  male participants  in EEG data analysis.  Volunteers  
were either students  or medical  staﬀ of the University  Medical  Center 
Hamburg  and received  a monetary  compensation  for the EEG recording  
sessions.  
The inclusion  criteria  included  male sex, an age between  18 –
40 years (mean 24 years, 19 - 32 years, SD 3.7 years), right-handedness  
as assessed  by means of the Edinburgh  Handedness  Scale (mean 77.2%, 
48 - 100%, SD 16.8%),  normal  or corrected  visual acuity and German  at 
native speaker  level. All participants  had normal  IQ as tested with the 
German  WST vocabulary  test (mean 111.5 points, 99 - 122 points, SD 
6.3 points).  and they had experienced  an average  of 16.5 educational  
years (13 - 21 years, SD 2.4 years). The sample was limited to partici-  
pants of male sex based on safety concerns  regarding  the application  of 
S-ketamine  in case of an undetected  pregnancy.  
Exclusion  criteria  were any acute or previous  psychiatric  disorders,  
a family history of schizophrenia  or bipolar  disorder,  the use of illegal 
drugs, active medication  or health conditions  representing  a contraindi-  
cation to the administration  of S-ketamine.  All subjects  were screened  
with pure tone audiometry  for seven frequencies  ranging  from 120 to 
8000 Hz (Esser Home Audiometer  2.0) in order to ensure normal  hear- 
ing in both ears. Participants  with an auditory  threshold  higher than 
20 dB in any of the frequencies  were excluded  from the study. 
The required  sample size was calculated  using G ∗ Power 3.1 
( Faul et al., 2007 ). With respect to the reduction  of the aeGBR amplitude  
through  the application  of S-ketamine  and the potential  attenuation  of 
this eﬀect via pretreatment  with glycine,  we expected  a medium  eﬀect 
size in the range of 𝜂p 2 = 0.1. This estimation  was based on a previous  
study comparing  the eﬀect of the administration  of S-ketamine  on the 
aeGBR to placebo  ( d = 0.6) ( Curic et al., 2019 ). We planned  to apply 
regular  statistical  analyses  and error probabilities  (ANOVA,  𝛼= 0.05; 
1- 𝛽= 0.95). Thus, the sample size analyses  led to a total sample size of 
n = 21 required  for a repeated  measure,  within factors ANOVA  for one 
group and four measurements.  To completely  counterbalance  the order 
of the four experimental  conditions,  we decided  to include  24 partici-

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118841,"Introduction  
In everyday  life, we encounter  situations  where we are required  to 
form rapid perceptual  decisions  based on ambiguous  sensory  informa-  
tion ( Philiastides  et al., 2017 ; Philiastides  and Heekeren,  2009 ). This can 
involve  processing  information  presented  to multiple  sensory  modal- 
ities ( Alais et al., 2010 ; Ghazanfar  and Schroeder,  2006 ), a process  
commonly  referred  to as multisensory  decision-making  ( Bizley et al., 
2016 ; Drugowitsch  et al., 2014 ; Franzen  et al., 2020 ; Rapaso  et al., 
2012 ). Previous  research  has shown decision-making  beneﬁts  deriving  
from complementary  features  of information  across multiple  sensory  
modalities  ( Ernst and Bülthoﬀ,  2004 ). The brain’s tendency  to system-  
atically  map implicitly  learnt associations  between  features  of informa-  
tion across sensory  modalities  is referred  to as cross-modal  association

When exposed  to complementary  features  of sensory  information,  fea- 
tures that refer to the same object are redundantly  associated,  forming  
cross-modal  associations,  enabling  the brain to exploit the correlation  
between  such informational  cues when forming  perceptual  decisions  
from ambiguous,  and often noisy, unisensory  information  ( Bien et al., 
2012 ; Glicksohn  and Cohen, 2013 ) . 
Cross-modal  associations  have been shown to inﬂuence  the con- 
solidation  of multisensory  information  when forming  perceptual  de- 
cisions ( Bizley et al., 2016 ; Drugowitsch  et al., 2014 ; Engel et al., 
2012 ). This has been evidenced  in studies that have used speeded  
classiﬁcation  paradigms,  demonstrating  behavioural  eﬀects such as in- 
creased  response  speed (i.e. decreased  reaction  times; RTs; Kayser and 
Kayser,  2018 ; Laurienti  et al., 2004 ; Silva et al., 2017 ), increased  choice

accuracy  ( Franzen  et al., 2020 ; Kayser and Kayser,  2018 ; Kayser et al., 
2017 ; Kim et al., 2008 ), and improved  stimulus  detection  ( Adam and 
Noppeney,  2014 ; Aller et al., 2015 ). These associative  inﬂuences  to- 
wards multisensory  decision-making  are consistently  attributed  to the 
modulatory  eﬀects of cross-modal  (in)congruency  ( Marks, 2004 ), i.e. 
modulations  in behavioural  performance  when a multisensory  stimulus  
has two or more features  that are (un)favourably  mapped.  Preferential,  
or anticipated,  cross-modal  associations,  are referred  to as congruent  , 
whereas  non-preferential,  or non-anticipated,  cross-modal  associations,  
are referred  to as incongruent  . A paradigmatic  example  demonstrated  ex- 
tensively  across previous  literature  concerns  auditory  pitch-visual  size 
associations  ( Bien et al., 2012 ; Evans and Tresiman,  2010 ; Gallace  and 
Spence,  2006 ; Parise and Spence,  2009 ; 2008 ; 2012 ). Congruent  audi- 
tory pitch-visual  size associations  map high-pitch  tones with small-size  
objects,  and low-pitch  tones with large-size  objects,  whereas  their incon- 
gruent counterparts  map high-pitch  tones with large-size  objects,  and 
low-pitch  tones with small-size  objects.  
Previous  research  has demonstrated  that the congruency  of audi- 
tory pitch-visual  size associations  modulates  behavioural  performance,  
in particular,  beneﬁtting  the formation  of perceptual  decisions.  For ex- 
ample, Gallace  and Spence (2006) found, using a visual discrimina-  
tion paradigm,  that participants  responded  more rapidly  (i.e. decreased  
RTs) when auditory  stimulus  pitch (high/low-pitch  tones) was congru-  
ent with the visual stimulus  size (small/large-size  disks) than when in- 
congruent  or no auditory  stimulus  was presented.  Similarly,  Parise and 
Spence (2008) found that when participants  were asked to judge the 
temporal  order of two diﬀerent-sized  visual stimuli (large/small-size  
grey circles),  congruent  auditory  tones increased  choice accuracy  (i.e. 
higher sensitivity  temporal  order judgements).  In contrast,  in a follow- 
up study, participants  judged the spatial discrepancy  of an auditory  stim- 
ulus less accurately  (i.e. higher just noticeable  diﬀerence  discrimina-  
tion thresholds)  when presented  congruently  with the visual stimulus,  
suggesting  a decisional  bias of congruency  and showing  that the be- 
havioural  eﬀects of congruency  depend  on the task at hand ( Parise and 
Spence,  2009 ). Finally,  decreased  RTs for congruent,  compared  to in- 
congruent,  pairings  were found when only one unisensory  stimulus  fea- 
ture was presented  per trial using an Implicit  Association  Test (IAT; 
Parise and Spence,  2012 ). 
The neural basis of cross-modal  associations  within perceptual  de- 
cision formation  has recently  become  a focus of human electrophys-  
iology and neuroimaging  research  ( Spence et al., 2011 ; Bizley et al., 
2016 ). However,  the neural mechanisms  facilitating  these behavioural  
enhancements  remain less well understood.  In particular,  it is not clear 
whether  such improvements  reﬂect the consequences  of ‘early’ sensory  
processing  beneﬁts,  or ‘late’ post-sensory  changes  in decision  dynamics,  
or both. For example,  auditory  pitch-visual  size congruency  eﬀects have 
been identiﬁed  across two Event-Related  Potentials  (ERPs) at ∼250 ms 
and ∼300 ms at parietal  and frontal electrodes  respectively  ( Bien et al., 
2012 ), whereas  neural modulations  of associative  semantic  congruency  
have been found in parahippocampal,  dorsomedial,  and orbitofrontal  
cortices  at ∼100 ms and ∼400 ms post-stimulus  ( Diaconescu  et al., 
2011 ). Similarly,  signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  between  congruent  and incon- 
gruent learned  label-object  associations  have been identiﬁed  as early as 
∼140 ms across occipital  regions,  whereas  mismatches  to the learned  as- 
sociations  evoked  a modulation  between  ∼340 ms and ∼520 ms across 
parietal  regions  ( Kovic et al., 2010 ). Overall,  the above studies have 
started to shed light on the neural underpinnings  of associative  con- 
gruency  across various  association  types, yet they have not provided  a 
conclusive  mechanistic  account  of how the brain uses cross-modal  asso- 
ciations  to improve  the eﬃciency  of perceptual  decisions.  
Diﬃculties  in identifying  the neural basis of cross-modal  associa-  
tions further stems from the utilisation  of experimental  paradigms  that 
present  two or more unisensory  features.  Previous  research  has asso- 
ciated multiple  neural processes  with the observed  decision-making  
beneﬁts,  in particular  i) multisensory  integration;  integrating  informa-  
tion across sensory  modalities  into uniﬁed percepts  ( Angelaki  et al., 2009 ; Calvert  et al., 2004 ; Mercier  and Cappe, 2020 ), or ii) a form 
of selective  attention;  dividing  attentional  resources  towards  attend- 
ing to task-relevant  information  in one sensory  modality,  and ignor- 
ing task-irrelevant  information  in another  modality  ( Bien et al., 2012 ; 
Choi et al., 2018 ; Gallace  and Spence,  2006 ; Marks, 2004 ). Attend-  
ing to two simultaneously  presented  stimulus  features  may facilitate  
enhancements  to perceptual  decision  formation  from beneﬁts  not di- 
rectly attributed  to genuine  cross-modal  associations.  As such, any 
underlying  neural activity  will display  mixed selectivity  representing  
a variety of sensory,  decision-related,  and other task-relevant  signals 
( Chandrasekaran,  2017 ; Dahl et al., 2009 ; Fusi et al., 2016 ; Kobak et al., 
2016 ; Park et al., 2014 ; Raposo  et al., 2014 ; Rigotti et al., 2013 ). 
Therefore,  it remains  diﬃcult  to characterise  whether  cross-modal  as- 
sociations  represent  early sensory  processing  beneﬁts  and/or late post- 
sensory  changes  to decision  dynamics  during the formation  of percep-  
tual decisions.  
In this study, we sought to capitalise  on the novelty  of using a mod- 
iﬁed variant of the Implicit  Association  Test (IAT), demonstrated  by 
Parise and Spence (2012) , to induce auditory  pitch-visual  size cross- 
modal associations  from the presentation  of one unisensory  stimulus  
feature (i.e. auditory  pitch). The IAT presents  one stimulus  feature per 
trial and manipulates  associative  congruency  by switching  the stimu- 
lus feature-response  key mappings  across blocks of trials. Therefore,  
the proposed  experimental  manipulations  overcome  the methodologi-  
cal limitations  present  in previous  research.  First, the presentation  of 
one sensory  stimulus  feature limits confounding  eﬀects from the pro- 
cesses of multisensory  integration  and selective  attention.  Second,  the 
manipulation  of associative  congruency  across blocks limits confound-  
ing eﬀects from explicit  stimulus  feature mappings  and subjective  re- 
porting  of cross-modal  associations.  Thus, by coupling  this paradigm  
with electroencephalography  (EEG), we can record the neural activity  
underlying  formulated  auditory  pitch-visual  size associations,  which is 
less likely to be aﬀected  by confounding  activity  attributed  to processing  
multisensory  stimuli.  
Using this paradigm,  we aim to mechanistically  characterise  the neu- 
ral dynamics  underlying  cross-modal  associations  during perceptual  de- 
cision formation.  To achieve  this, we ﬁrst analysed  single-trial  EEG ac- 
tivity using multivariate  Linear Discriminant  Analysis  (LDA; Parra et al., 
2002 ; 2005 ; Philiastides  and Sajda, 2006 ; Philiastides  et al., 2006 ; 
Philiastides  et al., 2014 ; Sajda et al., 2009 ). Then, to dissect the con- 
stituent  processes  underlying  the eﬀects of pitch-driven  associations  on 
perceptual  decision  formation,  we adopted  a neurally-informed  cognitive  
modelling  approach  ( Delis et al., 2018; Diaz et al., 2017; Franzen  et al., 
2020; Kayser and Shams, 2015; Turner et al., 2013, 2016, 2017 ). This 
approach  links underlying  latent behavioural  variables  to hypothesised  
cognitive  processes,  and further constrains  model ﬁts with recorded  
neuroimaging  data, to interpret  the modulation  of neural activity  un- 
der diﬀerent  experimental  conditions.  Previous  neurally-informed  cog- 
nitive modelling  research  has provided  mechanistic  characterisations  of 
neural activity  underlying  perceptual  decision  formation,  and recently,  
multisensory  decision-making  ( Delis et al., 2018 ; Franzen  et al., 2020 ; 
Mercier  and Cappe, 2020 ). Here we used a neurally-informed  Hierar- 
chical Drift Diﬀusion  Model (HDDM;  Wiecki et al., 2013 ) to understand  
how the neural representations  of auditory-driven  pitch-size  associa-  
tions drive behavioural  beneﬁts  to perceptual  decision  formation.  Using 
this approach,  we can extract sensory  and decision-speciﬁc  processes  
from brain activity  and relate these to associative  congruency  beneﬁts  
when forming  perceptual  decisions.  
Methods  and materials  
Participants  
20 participants  (male = 7, female = 13; age range = 19–
32 years) were recruited  for this study. All participants  reported  
normal/corrected-to-normal  vision and normal  hearing.  Participants  
2  J. Bolam, S.C. Boyle, R.A.A. Ince et al. NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118841 
were recruited  using the University  of Glasgow  Subject  Pool and re- 
ceived £6/hour  (UK Sterling)  for their participation.  The study was ap- 
proved by the ethics committee  of the College  of Science  and Engineer-  
ing at the University  of Glasgow  (CSE application  number  300,130,001),  
and was conducted  in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki.  
Stimuli 
We used two auditory  and two visual stimuli,  which were created  
and presented  using MATLAB  (Mathworks)  and the Psychophysics  Tool- 
box Extensions  ( Brainard,  1997 ). Auditory  stimuli consisted  of two 
300 ms pure tones (‘high’ and ‘low’ pitch, 2000 Hz and 100 Hz respec- 
tively). Visual stimuli consisted  of two light grey circles (‘small’  and 
‘large’, 2 cm and 5 cm, 1.1°and  2.8°of visual angle respectively).  The 
sound intensity  of each tone was matched  to 72 dB(A) SPL for left and 
right ears using a sound level metre. Auditory  stimuli were presented  
using Sennheiser  headphones  and visual stimuli were presented  on a

The IAT is a two-alternative  forced-choice  (2AFC)  task that mea- 
sures implicit  perceptual  associations  between  two arbitrary  stimu- 
lus features  by manipulating  stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  
( Greenwald  et al., 1998 ). In one block of trials, two stimulus  features  
are assigned,  or mapped  , to the same response  key, whereas  in a sepa- 
rate block of trials, they are assigned  to diﬀerent  response  keys. Reac- 
tion times (RTs) and choice accuracy  are collected  as dependant  vari- 
able measurements  of behavioural  performance  (and perceptual  choice 
formation).  The IAT assumes  that the congruency  of stimulus  feature-  
response  key mappings  modulates  behavioural  performance,  with per- 
ceptual  choices  faster (i.e. lower RTs) and more accurate  (i.e. higher 
choice accuracy)  when stimulus  features  are assigned  to the same re- 
sponse key than when assigned  to diﬀerent  response  keys. 
This study used a modiﬁed  version  of the IAT, adapted  from 
Parise and Spence (2012) , to formulate  auditory  pitch-visual  size cross- 
modal associations  ( Fig. 1 ). In this version,  on each block, one audi- 
tory (high-pitch/low-pitch  tone) and one visual (small-size/large-size  
circle) stimulus  feature are assigned  to each response  key. Participants  
are then instructed  to categorise  as quickly  and as accurately  as possi- 
ble which stimulus  feature was presented  on a single-trial  basis using 
the correctly  assigned  response  key. Congruency  was manipulated  by 
switching  the stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  across blocks of 
trials. Congruent  mappings  assigned  high-pitch  tones and small-size  cir- 
cles to the left response  key, and low-pitch  tones and large-size  circles 
to the right response  key ( Fig. 1 , top ). Incongruent  mappings,  however,  
switched  the auditory  stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  only, so 
that high-pitch  tones and low-pitch  tones were assigned  to the right 
and left response  keys respectively  ( Fig. 1 , bottom ). These mappings  
justify previous  ﬁndings,  which suggested  that high-pitch  tones are of- 
ten preferentially  associated  with small-size  visual objects,  and vice 
versa ( Gallace  and Spence,  2006 ; Evans and Treisman,  2010 ; Parise and 
Spence,  2012 ). The assigned  visual stimulus  features  remained  ﬁxed 
across blocks for two reasons:  (1) Pilot testing found that participants  
started to exhibit cross-modal  associations  between  visual size and their 
assigned  response  keys, rather than their auditory  pitch counterparts.  
Speciﬁcally,  small-size  and large-size  visual objects were associated  with 
left and right response  keys respectively.  (2) In total, experimental  ses- 
sions ran for ∼3 h ( ∼2 h for EEG setup/cleanup,  ∼1.5 h for the task 
of 1280 trials per subject).  Taken together,  this made it diﬃcult  to de- 
sign a cross-modal  association  experiment  where the auditory  and vi- 
sual stimuli were counterbalanced,  and participants  were not asked to 
spend more than three hours in a single laboratory  session.  For these 
reasons,  we chose to only manipulate  auditory  pitch-response  key map- 
pings, therefore  manipulating  auditory  stimulus  feature congruency,  across blocks. These stimulus  feature-response  key mapping  manipula-  
tions are consistent  with the mapping  manipulations  used in the study 
by Parise and Spence (2012) . 
Procedure  
Participants  completed  the experiment  in a dark and electrically  
shielded  room. Each block began with instructions  on the auditory  pitch- 
visual size mapping  between  stimuli and response  keys (see Implicit As- 
sociation  Test section).  Participants  were given as much time as they 
needed  to memorize  the instructions  for the upcoming  block. Each trial 
started with a ﬁxation  cross presented  centrally  on-screen  for a random-  
ized period (uniform  distribution  from 500 to 1000 ms). Then, one of the 
four stimuli (see Stimuli section)  were selected  randomly  and presented  
for 300 ms. Participants  were instructed  to categorize,  as quickly  and 
as accurately  as possible,  the presented  stimulus  using the left and right 
keyboard  response  keys, as deﬁned  by the instructions  given for that 
speciﬁc  block (see Implicit Association  Test section).  Feedback  was given 
after each trial, with green ﬁxation  crosses given for correct response  
choices,  and red ﬁxation  crosses given for incorrect  response  choices.  
Feedback  was provided  for a randomised  duration  (uniform  distribu-  
tion from 300 ms to 600 ms). In total, participants  completed  8 blocks 
(4 blocks each for the congruency  of stimulus  feature-response  key map- 
pings presented  in a randomized  order) for a total of 1280 trials (160 
trials per block; 40 trials for each stimulus  feature).  
Analysis  of behavioural  data 
For each participant,  median  RTs and choice accuracy  (calculated  as 
the proportion  of correct choices  over all trials) were used as dependant  
variable  measurements  of behavioural  performance.  These were calcu- 
lated separately  for two independent  variables:  i) stimulus  feature (au- 
ditory: high-pitch/low-pitch  tones; visual: small-size/large-size  circles),  
and ii) congruency  of stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  (congru-  
ent/incongruent).  To further assess the eﬀect of switching  auditory  stim- 
ulus feature-response  key mappings,  we calculated  RTs for correct and 
incorrect  choice responses.  Trials with RTs less than 300 ms, or more 
than 1200 ms, were excluded  from further analysis,  as behavioural  per- 
formance  on such trials is often attributed  to “fast guesses  ”( < 300 ms) or 
attentional  lapses ( > 1200 ms) during testing ( Whelan,  2008 ). Overall,  
905 trials (auditory:  677 trials; visual: 228 trials) were excluded  from 
further analysis,  leaving  a total of 9850 trials for auditory  stimuli and 
10,323 trials for visual stimuli 
As anticipated,  RT data was not normally  distributed  
( Whelan,  2008 ). Therefore,  we statistically  analysed  median  RTs 
and choice accuracy  using Wilcoxon  Matched-Pairs  Signed-Rank  tests, 
and further analysed  RTs for correct and incorrect  choices  responses  
using Mann-Whitney  U Paired tests. Eﬀect sizes were calculated  by 
dividing  the Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  test statistic  ( Z ) by the square 
root of the test population  ( N = 20) for stimulus  features  (auditory:  
high-pitch/low-pitch  tones; visual: small-size/large-size  circles)  and 
congruency  (congruent/incongruent)  respectively  ( Rosenthal  et al., 
1994 ). For Mann-Whitney  U Paired testing analysing  RTs of correct 
and incorrect  choices  within each congruency  and stimulus  feature 
condition  for auditory  stimuli,  eﬀect sizes were calculated  by dividing  
the Mann-Whitney  U test statistic  ( Z ) by the square root of the total 
number  of trials for correct and incorrect  responses  in each congruency  
condition  (congruent/incongruent)  and stimulus  feature condition  
(high-pitch/low-pitch  tones). For Mann-Whitney  U Paired testing 
analysing  RTs of correct and incorrect  choices  across congruency  and 
auditory  stimulus  feature conditions,  eﬀect sizes were calculated  by 
dividing  the Mann-Whitney  U test statistic  ( Z ) by the square root of the 
total number  of trials in each accuracy  condition  (correct/incorrect)  
across congruency  and auditory  stimulus  feature conditions  This en- 
abled us to analyse  the eﬀects of both congruent/incongruent  stimulus  
feature-response  key mapping  conditions,  and high-pitch/low-pitch

Fig. 1. Implicit  association  test. Participants  were presented  with one unisensory  stimulus  feature (auditory  high/low-pitch  tone; visual small/large-size  circle) per 
trial, and were asked to categorize  which stimulus  feature, within that modality,  was presented  as quickly and accurately  as possible,  using the correct response  key 
(left/right).  Auditory  congruency  (congruent/incongruent)  was manipulated  by switching  the stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  across blocks ( top , congruent

tone presentations  for correct and incorrect  RTs respectively.  Post hoc 
power analyses  were conducted  using G ∗ Power ( Faul et al., 2007 ; 2009 ) 
to assess whether  any identiﬁed  signiﬁcant  results were of suﬃcient  
statistical  power ( Cohen 1992a ; 1992b ; see the Power analyses  section 
in Supplementary  materials  ). Statistical  analysis  of all behavioural  data 
was completed  using R. 
EEG recording  and preprocessing  
Continuous  EEG data was recorded  in a sound-attenuated  and elec- 
trostatically  shielded  room using a 128-channel  BioSemi  ampliﬁer  sys- 
tem and ActiView  recording  software  (Biosemi,  Amsterdam,  Nether-  
lands). Signals were sampled  and digitized  at 512 Hz, then band-pass  
ﬁltered  online between  0.16 and 100 Hz. Signals originating  from ocular 
muscles  were recorded  from four additional  electrooculography  (EOG) 
electrodes  placed below and at the outer canthi of each eye. 
Individual  blocks of data were preprocessed  using the Fieldtrip  Tool- 
box ( Oostenveld  et al., 2011 ), which was implemented  in MATLAB  us- 
ing custom  scripts. Epochs of 2 s, from − 0.5 to 1.5 s relative  to stim- 
ulus onset, were extracted  and ﬁltered  between  0.5 and 90 Hz using 
a Butterworth  ﬁlter, before being down-sampled  to 200 Hz. Potential  
signal artefacts  were removed  using Independent  Component  Analysis  
(ICA), using the Fieldtrip  toolbox  ( Oostenveld  et al., 2011 ). Compo-  
nents related to typical eye movement  activities,  such as blinks, or noisy 
electrode  channels  were removed.  Horizontal,  vertical,  and radial EOG 
signals were further processed  using established  procedures  ( Hipp and 
Siegel, 2013 ; Keren et al., 2010 ) and trials with high correlations  be- 
tween eye movements  (e.g. saccades)  and components  in the EEG data removed.  Remaining  trials with amplitudes  that exceeded  ± 120 μV were 
also removed.  Successful  cleaning  was veriﬁed  by visual inspection  of 
single trials. 
EEG signal analysis  - Linear Discriminant  Analysis  
We applied  single-trial  multivariate  Linear Discriminant  Analy- 
sis (LDA; Parra et al., 2002 ; 2005 ; Philiastides  and Sajda, 2006 ; 
Philiastides  et al., 2006 ; Philiastides  et al., 2014 ; Sajda et al., 2009 ) to 
extract EEG components  discriminating  between  congruent  and incon- 
gruent trials for auditory  stimulus-locked  EEG data only. Speciﬁcally,  
for a pre-deﬁned  time window  of interest,  this method  applies a linear 
multivariate  classiﬁer  to EEG data in order to estimate  a spatial weight-  
ing vector that quantiﬁes  the optimal  combination  of EEG sensor lin- 
ear weights.  When applied  to multichannel  EEG data, this yields a one- 
dimensional  projection  that maximally  discriminates  between  two con- 
ditions of interest.  This projection  represents  the ‘discriminating  compo-  
nent’ that integrates  all signal information  across the multichannel  EEG 
array, while reducing  eﬀects common  to both conditions.  Compared  
to univariate  trial-averaging  approaches,  notably  Event-Related/Evoked  
Response  Potential  (ERP) analyses,  multivariate  approaches  are better 
able to spatially  integrate  information  across the multidimensional  EEG 
sensor space, yielding  components  which both preserve  inter-trial  signal 
variability  and increase  the signal-to-noise  ratio ( Sajda et al., 2011 ) for 
preserved  task-relevant  information.  Note that the term ‘component’  is 
preferred  instead  of ‘source’  in order to make clear that this is a projec- 
tion of all EEG activity  correlated  with the underlying  source.

We used a sliding window  approach  ( Parra et al., 2005 ; Sajda et al., 
2009 ) to identify  a projection  of the multichannel  EEG signal, 𝑥 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , 
where 𝑖 = [ 1 …𝑁 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑠 ] , and 𝑁is the total number  of trials, within short 
time windows  that maximally  discriminated  between  congruent  and in- 
congruent  trials for auditory  stimulus  features  only. All time windows  
had a width of 50 ms, with the window  centre 𝑡 shifted from − 100 ms to 
800 ms, relative  to auditory  stimulus-onset,  in 5 ms increments.  Specif- 
ically, we used logistic  regression  ( Parra et al., 2002 ; 2005 ) to learn a 
128-channel  spatial weighting  vector 𝑤 ( 𝑡 ) that achieved  maximal  dis- 
crimination  within each time window.  This yields a one dimensional  
projection,  𝑦 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , for each trial 𝑖 and given window  𝑡 : 
𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑤 𝑇 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐷 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝑤 𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 
Here, 𝐷represents  the number  of channels  in the multichannel  EEG 
array and 𝑇 refers to a matrix transpose  operator.  Our classiﬁer  was de- 
signed to map component  amplitudes,  𝑦 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , for congruent  and incongru-  
ent trials, that separates  activity  maximizing  diﬀerences  and minimiz-  
ing similarities  of eﬀects from neural processes  common  to both con- 
ditions.  In discriminating  the two congruency  categories,  the classiﬁer  
maps negative  and positive  discriminant  component  amplitudes  to con- 
gruent and incongruent  trials respectively.  Thus, larger negative  values 
indicate  a higher likelihood  of categorizing  auditory  stimuli within con- 
gruent stimulus  feature-response  key mappings,  and larger positive  val- 
ues indicate  a higher likelihood  of categorizing  auditory  stimuli within 
incongruent  stimulus  feature-response  key mappings,  with values near 
zero reﬂecting  less discriminative  component  amplitudes.  
We quantiﬁed  classiﬁcation  performance  of our classiﬁer  for each 
time window  using the area under a receiver  operating  characteris-  
tic (ROC) curve ( Green and Swets, 1966 ), referred  to as an 𝐴 𝑧 value, 
using a leave-one-out  cross-validation  procedure  ( Gherman  and Phil- 
iastides,  2015 ; Philiastides  and Sajda, 2006 ). To determine  group sig- 
niﬁcance  thresholds  for discriminator  performance,  we implemented  a 
permutation  test, whereby  congruent  and incongruent  trial labels were 
randomized  and submitted  to the leave-one-out  procedure.  This ran- 
domization  procedure  was repeated  1000 times, producing  a probabil-  
ity distribution  for 𝐴 𝑧 , which we used as reference  to estimate  the 𝐴 𝑧 
value leading  to a signiﬁcance  level of 𝑝 < 0 . 05 . 
Finally,  the linearity  of our model allowed  us to compute  scalp pro- 
jections  of the discriminating  components  resulting  from Eq. (1) by es- 
timating  a forward  model as: 
𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 
𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑇 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 
where the EEG data ( 𝑥 ) and discriminating  components  ( 𝑦 ) are orga- 
nized as matrix and vector notations,  respectively,  for convenience.  
Here, the EEG matrix,  𝑥 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , denotes  channel  activity  across rows and tri- 
als across columns  for all 5 ms increments  in time window  𝑡 , whereas  dis- 
criminating  components,  𝑦 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , are organized  as single-trial  vectors,  𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) , 
with each row is from trial 𝑖 . Such forward  model implementations  can 
be displayed  as scalp topographies  and interpreted  as the coupling  be- 
tween discriminating  component  amplitudes  and observed  multichannel  
EEG activity,  whereby  vector 𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) reﬂects  the coupling  of the discriminat-  
ing component  𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) that explains  most of the activity  in 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) , with maps 
illustrating  this optimal  component-activity  coupling  ( Philiastides  et al., 
2014 ). 
Hierarchical  Drift Diﬀusion  Model –description  
We ﬁt participants’  behavioural  performance  i.e. RTs and choice ac- 
curacy,  with a Hierarchical  Drift Diﬀusion  Model (HDDM;  Wiecki et al., 
2013 ). Similar  to the traditional  Drift Diﬀusion  Model (DDM; 
Ratcliﬀ et  al., 2015 ; R. 2016 ; Forstmann  et al., 2016 ; Ratcliﬀ and  
McKoon,  2008 ; Ratcliﬀ,  1978 ), the HDDM assumes  sensory  evidence  
is stochastically  accumulated  over time, towards  one of two decision  boundaries,  corresponding  to two choice alternatives  (e.g. correct or in- 
correct choices;  left or right response  keys). For each decisional  process,  
the HDDM returns parameter  estimates  of four internal  components  of 
perceptual  decision-making,  (1) the rate of evidence  accumulation  (drift 
rate), (2) possible  a priori bias towards  one of the two choice alternatives  
(starting  point), (3) the distance  between  two decision  boundaries  con- 
trolling  the amount  of evidence  required  for one particular  choice alter- 
native (decision  boundary),  and (4) the duration  of non-decisional  pro- 
cesses, which can include  time taken for stimulus  encoding  and motor- 
response  production  latency  (non-decision  time). 
Hierarchical  Drift Diﬀusion  Model –ﬁtting  
To ﬁt HDDM to participants’  performance  and estimate  internal  de- 
cisional  processes,  we used the HDDM toolbox  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ), 
an open-source  software  package,  written  in Python,  that permits  cus- 
tom ﬁts of HDDM variants  to participants’  RTs and choice accuracy.  
The HDDM uses a Bayesian  hierarchical  framework  to estimate  the 
above four parameters,  whereby  sampled  prior probability  distributions  
of the model parameters  are updated  based on a likelihood  function,  
formed  from the data given to the model, to yield posterior  proba- 
bility distributions.  The HDDM uses Markov-Chain  Monte Carlo sam- 
pling within this framework,  whereby  prior distributions  of estimated  
parameters  are iteratively  adjusted  by a likelihood  function  that max- 
imizes the log likelihood  of predicted  mean RTs and choice accuracy  
( Gamerman  and Lopes, 2006 ). The use of Bayesian  hierarchical  frame- 
works, and speciﬁcally  the HDDM,  allows for several beneﬁts  relative  
to traditional  (non-hierarchical)  DDM analysis.  First, such frameworks  
assume  that participants’  samples  in a dataset are randomly  drawn from 
a group ( Vadekerchkove  et al., 2011 ), thereby  constraining  participant-  
and group-level  posterior  distributions,  which yield more stable param- 
eter estimates  for individual  participants  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ). Second,  
the HDDM has been found to be more robust in achieving  stable pa- 
rameter  estimates  in datasets  with low numbers  of trials, compared  to 
non-hierarchical  DDM approaches  ( Ratcliﬀand  Childers,  2015 ). Third, 
rather than quantifying  the most likely value for each parameter,  un- 
certainty  can be directly  conveyed  with posterior  distributions  for each 
estimated  parameter  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ; Navarro  and Fuss, 2009 ; 
Gelman,  2003 ). Fourth,  and most importantly  for our analysis,  the 
HDDM framework  supports  the use of external  variables  as regressors  
of estimated  model parameters,  to assess the relations  between  speciﬁc  
parameters  with further behavioural  or neuroimaging  data ( Delis et al., 
2018 ; Frank et al., 2015 ; Franzen  et al., 2020 ; Mercier  and Cappe, 2020 ; 
Tremel and Wheeler,  2015 ). 
To implement  the HDDM,  we used a process  referred  to as ‘accuracy-  
coding’  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ), which ﬁts the HDDM to RT distributions  
that assume  the upper and lower decision  boundaries  corresponding  to 
correct and incorrect  choices  respectively.  We sampled  parameter  esti- 
mates for drift rate ( 𝛿), decision  boundary  ( 𝜃), and non-decision  time 
( 𝜏). Starting  point (z) was set as the midpoint  between  the two deci- 
sion boundaries,  since the IAT had no a priori bias towards  either choice 
alternative  (i.e. response  key; Philiastides  et al., 2011 ). We did not in- 
clude any inter-trial  variability  parameters  in our models as previous  
studies have shown that it is diﬃcult  to achieve  stable posterior  esti- 
mates, particularly  with fewer trials ( Boehm et al., 2018 ; Ratcliﬀ and  
Childers,  2015 ). For each model, we ran 5 separate  Markov  chains with 
11,000 samples  each. For each chain, the ﬁrst 1000 were discarded  as 
“burn-in  ”, and the rest subsampled  ( “thinned  ”) by a factor of two, to 
reduce the autocorrelation  within and between  Markov  chains. This is 
a conventional  approach  to MCMC sampling,  whereby  initial samples  
in the “burn-in  ”period  are based on the selection  of a random  starting  
point, and neighbouring  samples  likely to be highly correlated.  Both is- 
sues are likely to provide  unreliable  posterior  distributions  for estimated  
parameters.  This left 25,000 remaining  samples  for our model, which 
constituted  the probability  distributions  for each estimated  parameter,  
allowing  us to compute  individual  parameter  estimates  for participants  
5  J. Bolam, S.C. Boyle, R.A.A. Ince et al. NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118841 
and condition  categories.  To ensure Markov  chain convergence,  we 
computed  Gelman-Rubin  Ȓ statistics  between  chains ( Gelman  and Ru- 
bin, 1992 ). This compares  within-chain  and between-chain  variance  of 
estimated  parameters  both for individual  participants  and group condi- 
tions. We veriﬁed  that all Ȓstatistics  fell between  0.98 and 1.02, which 
suggests  reliable  convergence  between  chains. 
Hierarchical  Drift Diﬀusion  Model –EEG regressors  
We sought to use our EEG discrimination  analysis  results to inform 
the ﬁtting of the HDDM to our behavioural  data (i.e. RTs and choices).  
Speciﬁcally,  we used the HDDM toolbox  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ) to con- 
struct regressors  that assessed  the trial-by-trial  linear relationship  be- 
tween our single-trial  EEG discriminator  amplitudes  (for congruent  and 
incongruent  trials) and posterior  estimates  for drift rate ( 𝛿) , decision  
boundary  ( 𝜃) , and non-decision  time ( 𝜏) . In line with our behavioural  
results,  in which we reported  a signiﬁcant  eﬀect of RTs decreasing  for 
congruent  trials, we hypothesized  that component  amplitudes  would 
be predictive  of increases  in the rate of evidence  accumulation  (drift 
rate) and decreases  in evidence  required  for categorising  auditory  stim- 
uli (decision  boundary).  For the duration  of non-decisional  processes  
(non-decision  time), we hypothesized  that either a) component  ampli- 
tudes for congruent  trials would be predictive  of decreases  in the du- 
ration of non-decisional  processes,  or b) component  amplitudes  for in- 
congruent  trials would be predictive  of increases  in the duration  of non- 
decisional  processes.  Therefore,  as part of the model ﬁtting within the 
HDDM framework,  we used our single-trial  EEG discriminator  ampli- 
tudes for congruent  and incongruent  trials to construct  regressors  for 
drift rate ( 𝛿) , decision  boundary  ( 𝜃) , and non-decision  time ( 𝜏) as fol- 
lows: 
𝛿= 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |||+ 𝛼2 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |||
𝜃= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |||+ 𝛽2 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |||
𝜏= 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |||+ 𝛾2 ∗ |||𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |||
where |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |and |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |are the maximum,  single-trial,  discriminator  
amplitudes  of subject-speciﬁc,  stimulus-locked  EEG components  captur-  
ing the highest  classiﬁcation  performance  between  congruent  and incon- 
gruent trials (corresponding  to group peak 𝐴 𝑧 values; Early ∼110 ms; 
Late ∼340 ms; see Fig. 3 ). Coeﬃcients  𝛼1 , 𝛽1 , 𝛾1 and 𝛼2 , 𝛽2 , 𝛾2 weight 
the slope of each parameter  by the absolute  values of |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |and |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |
respectively,  with intercepts  𝛼0 , 𝛽0 , 𝛾0 , on a trial-by-trial  basis for each 
subject and congruency  condition.  Note that we used the absolute  val- 
ues of our single-trial  EEG discriminator  amplitudes  to construct  regres- 
sors, since congruent  trials were predominantly  categorised  by negative  
|𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |and |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |values, and incongruent  trials were predominantly  cat- 
egorised  by positive  |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 |and |𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 |values respectively  (see EEG signal 
analysis  –Linear  Discriminant  Analysis  section).  Hence, by using these re- 
gression  coeﬃcients,  we were able to assess the trial-by-trial  modulatory  
eﬀects of each identiﬁed  component  on drift rate, decision  boundary,  
and non-decision  time in both congruency  conditions.  Consequently,  we 
can characterise  the behavioural  beneﬁts  of cross-modal  associative  con- 
gruency  on perceptual  decision  formation,  dissecting  which decisional  
processes  best predict decreases  in choice RT. 
To assess the posterior  predictive  power of our regression  coeﬃ- 
cients, we ﬁrst calculated  the posterior  probability  densities  of samples  
that diﬀered  from 0 using the built-in  functions  of the HDDM toolbox  
( Wiecki et al., 2013 ) corresponding  to our pre-deﬁned  hypotheses  pre- 
dicting the eﬀect of decreased  RTs for congruent  trials, and decreased  
RTs for incorrect  responses  for congruent  trials (albeit not signiﬁcantly  
aﬀecting  choice accuracy,  see Behavioural  results section).  For drift rate 
and incongruent  non-decision  time regression  coeﬃcients,  probability  
densities  were calculated  from the proportion  of samples  greater than 
0 (P( 𝛿> 0); P( 𝜏> 0)), whereas  for decision  boundary  and congruent  non-decision  time regression  coeﬃcients,  probability  densities  were cal- 
culated  from the proportion  of samples  less than 0 (P( 𝜃< 0); P( 𝜏< 0)). 
Then, we calculated  each coeﬃcient’s  posterior  log-odds  by applying  the 
logit function  to the proportion  of posterior  samples  in favour of their 
corresponding  hypothesis  ( Ince et al., 2020 ). This Bayesian  Inference  
approach  was utilised  because  Bayesian  hierarchical  modelling  frame- 
works violate the assumption  of independence  in its posterior  estimation  
sampling  procedure,  since group-level  and participant-level  parameter  
posteriors  are simultaneously  estimated  ( Wiecki et al., 2013 ). There- 
fore, null-hypothesis  signiﬁcance  testing approaches  commonly  utilised  
in frequentist  approaches  to statistical  analysis  are not recommended.  
To determine  the prevalence  of true positive  results,  implicating  strong 
predictive  eﬀects of our regression  coeﬃcients  on posterior  parameter  
estimations,  we further calculated  the log posterior  odds proportion  of 
a hypothetical  sample corresponding  to a false-positive  rate of ɑ = 0.05 
(i.e. a 95% true-positive  threshold).  Regression  coeﬃcient  log-odds  pro- 
portions  greater than the hypothetical  log-odds  proportion  of our false 
positive  rate (which is equal to 2.944) suggests  highly predictive  eﬀects 
of our regression  coeﬃcients  on changes  to estimated  posterior  param- 
eters favoured  by our hypotheses.

Participants  responded  faster in auditory  trials with congruent  com- 
pared to incongruent  stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  ( Fig. 2 b, 
Congruent:  median  = 608 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset; Incongruent:  643 ms 
post-stimulus  oﬀset). Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing  determined  this 
ﬁnding  to be statistically  signiﬁcant  ( Z = − 2.135, p = 0.033, ef- 
fect size = − 0.477, Wilcoxon  Signed-Rank  Testing).  This result held 
for both correct ( Fig. 2 f, Congruent/Correct:  median  = 611 ms post-

dian = 621 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset, Z = − 2.628, p = 0.004, eﬀect 
size = − 0.091, Mann-Whitney  U testing).  Furthermore,  RTs were sig- 
niﬁcantly  longer for correct compared  to incorrect  responses  for con- 
gruent stimulus  feature-response  key mappings  ( Fig. 2 f, Correct:  me-

Incorrect:  median  = 621 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset, Z = − 0.664, p = 0.253, 
eﬀect size = − 0.010, Mann-Whitney  U Testing).  We found no signiﬁ-

was also no signiﬁcant  eﬀect when testing correct ( Fig. 2 e, High- 
Pitch Tone/Correct:  median  = 626 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset; Low-Pitch  
Tone/Correct  = 626 post-stimulus  oﬀset, Z = 0.421, p = 0.663, eﬀect

set, Z = 0.420, p = 0.663, eﬀect size = 0.015, Mann-Whitney  U Test- 
ing). Furthermore,  we found no signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  in RT between  
correct and incorrect  responses  for either high-pitch  tones ( Fig. 2 e, Cor- 
rect: median  = 626 ms post-stimulus  oﬀset; Incorrect:  median  = 594 ms 
post-stimulus  oﬀset, Z = − 0.994, p = 0.172, eﬀect size = − 0.013,

ferred as dataset A - Munich),  and 17 subjects  (6 males; 64.7 ± 7.9 years) 
from ( Aiello et al., 2015 ) (hereby  referred  as dataset B - Naples).  Nine 
subjects  from the original  publication  by Aiello et al. (2015) were ex- 
cluded during processing  as functional  and/or structural  images were 
corrupted  by motion.  
The subjects,  with no previous  psychiatric  or neurological  history,  
provided  their informed  written  consent  according  to the Code of Ethics 
of the World Medical  Association  and the Institutional  Review  Board and 
Ethics Committee  at the Technische  Universität  München,  for dataset A 
( Riedl et al., 2014 ), and the SDN Foundation,  for dataset B ( Aiello et al.,

Both datasets  simultaneously  collected  18 F-FDG PET and fMRI data 
accompanied  by a structural  image on two identical  Biograph  mMR 3T 
scanners  (Siemens  Healthcare,  Erlangen,  Germany)  equipped  with the 
standard  head-neck  coil (12-channel).  The subjects  were lying in the 
scanner  with their eyes open without  performing  any task.

(TR/TE  = 2300/2.98  ms, FA = 9°, 1 mm isotropic  voxel size), and 300 vol 
(total scan time of 10 min and 8 s) of resting-state  fMRI T2 ∗ gradient-  
echo echo planar imaging  (GE-EPI,  TR/TE = 2000/30  ms and voxel size

The overall study followed  a randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-  
controlled  longitudinal  design. Three MRI examinations  with 21 days of 
(re-)learning  between  each session were conducted  (i.e., the MRIs were 
performed  on the 1 st , 22 nd and 43 rd day). For a subsample,  a test-retest  
scan was performed  21 days before the baseline,  to mitigate  the chance 
of misinterpreting  time- as learning-related  changes.  The subjects  were 
randomized  upon recruitment  to one of four groups learning  to match 
either Chinese  characters  to random  German  nouns or faces to faces and 
subsequently  relearn new associations  while receiving  placebo  or esci- 
talopram  ( Fig. 1 A). During the latter phase, the previous  associations  
(character-noun  / face-face)  were shuﬄed  and had to be relearned  fol- 
lowing the same time schedule.  The study medication  consisting  of a 
daily oral dose of 10 mg escitalopram  (Cipralex;  Lundbeck  A/S, Copen- 
hagen, Denmark;  provided  by the pharmacy  of the Medical  University  
of Vienna)  or placebo.  To monitor  the proper intake, the escitalopram  
blood plasma levels were assessed  around day 7, 14 and 21 of the re- 
learning  phase.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10212, 10216), match='2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1237, 1243), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119190,"2.1. Traditional  and Riemannian  DPs based on EEG cross-spectrum  
Quantitative  electroencephalography  (qEEG)  studies DPs obtained  
from the electroencephalogram  (EEG). These DPs encode physiolog-  
ically relevant  information.  Here we explain  the frequency  domain  
DPs deﬁned  with the EEG cross-spectrum.  Nonlinear  frequency-domain  
( Billings  and Tsang, 1989a , 1989b ), time-domain  ( Koenig et al., 2002 ), 
or time/frequency  domain  ( Makeig  et al., 2004 ) DPs are also essential.  
In later stages of the multinational  qEEG normative  project,  we will in- 
clude these types of DPs. Table 2 summarizes  EEG frequency  domain  
DPs, which we now describe  formally.  
With (discrete)  Fourier  transform,  the EEG signal 𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝑡 ) (for the 
subject 𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑖 , at the channel  𝑐, 𝑐 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑐and epoch 𝑒 , 
𝑒 = 1 , …, 𝑁𝑒 ) can be transformed  to the frequency  domain,  𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) 
(frequency  𝜔 = Δ𝜔, …, 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 where Δ𝜔 is the frequency  resolution)  
which is the complex-value  coeﬃcients.  The covariance  matrix across 
all epochs 𝑣 𝑖,𝑒,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) is the cross-spectral  matrix 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) at frequency  𝜔 . 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
is Hermitian  with elements  𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) . Note that the set of all 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) for 
all frequencies  𝜔 = Δ𝜔, …, 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 for a given subject 𝑖 is a 3-mode  
multi-dimensional  array with dimensions  𝑁 𝑐 ×𝑁 𝑐 ×𝑁 𝜔 . We remind  
the reader that this multi-dimensional  array is also known as a ten- 
sor , which we denote by S 𝑖 ( Fig. 1-a ). This concept  generalizes  that of 
a matrix.  An intuitive  way to think of the cross-spectral  tensor S 𝑖 is to 
consider  it a “slide box ”i n which each ""slide"" is a cross-spectral  ma- 
trix ( Fig. 1 -a). We defer a more formal discussion  about cross-spectra  as 
tensors to Appendix  A for the interested  reader. The set 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′(∶) for all 
frequencies  is known as a tube ( Fig. 1 -b). 
For example,  in this paper, the channel  number  𝑐 = 9 corresponds  to 
the recording  at the left occipital  channel  in the 10–20 system O1. 
2.1.1. Traditional  qEEG DPs 
The most traditional  DPs are the log-spectra  which are obtained  by 
applying  the logarithm  to the diagonal  elements  of cross-spectral  matri- 
ces 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ∈ℙ 𝑁𝑐 and stacking  them as a vector: 
𝝀( 𝜔 ) = [𝜆𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) , ], 
𝜆𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) = log (𝑠 𝑖,𝑐,𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) ), 
𝑐 = 1 , ..., 𝑁𝑐 
The complete  set of log spectral  DPs is then 𝐲 λ
𝑖 ∈ℝ NcN 𝜔 ( Fig. 1 -c), 
where 
𝐲 λ
𝑖 = [𝝀𝑖 ( Δ𝜔 ) 𝑇 , …, 𝝀𝑖 ( 𝑁𝜔 Δ𝜔 ) 𝑇 ]𝑇 (1) 
This vector is unconstrained,  and therefore  the assumption  that the 
𝒚 λ
𝑖 is sampled  from a multivariate  Gaussian  distribution  is reasonable,  
providing  a natural  link to quantify  BDD using standard  univariate  and 
multivariate  statistical  distances.  
These are the “traditional  DPs ”with which the PAVS lab developed  
qEEG norms calling the narrowband  developmental  equations  “Devel-  
opmental  surfaces  ”( Szava et al., 1994 ) since they are bivariate  func- 
tions of frequency  and age. Developmental  Surfaces  describe  EEG scalp 
channels  and sources  ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 2001 ). These norms are now 
extensively  used, with open-source  data and code ( Bosch-Bayard  et al., 
2020 ; Valdes-Sosa  et al., 2021 ). 
However,  the log spectra  DPs 𝐲 λ
𝑖 are measures  limited to separate  
channels.  The relations  between  channels  must be assessed  to study the 
vital aspect of functional  connectivity.  To do this, we must consider  
the oﬀ-diagonal  part of cross-spectral  matrices  1 . A popular  measure  is 
1 For some calculations,  using the complex  value of an oﬀ-diagonal  element  
𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) is inconvenient,  and instead, we decompose  these quantities  into their 
real and imaginary  parts (or absolute  values and phases).  We use the obvi- 
ous notation,  for example,  Real ( 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) ) , Imag ( 𝑠 𝑖,𝑐 ,𝑐 ′( 𝜔 ) ) in the case of the cross- 
spectrum.

Unfortunately,  when bundled  as a set with log-spectral  DPs, these “tradi- 
tional DPs ”are not jointly multivariate  Gaussian  2 , even when applying  
any of the usual data transformations  separately  to each measure.  
2.1.2. Riemannian  qEEG DPs 
The diﬃculties  of traditional  DPs mentioned  above can be remedied  
with the concept  of Riemannian  geometry.  Since the cross-spectral  ten- 
sor S 𝑖 comprises  frontal slices 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , we consider  these ﬁrst. 
2.1.2.1.  Riemann  geometry  of the cross-spectra  at a single frequency.  The 
𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) are well-known  mathematical  objects that we already  identiﬁed  
as Hermitian  positive  deﬁnite  (HPD) matrices  with unique properties,  
as discussed  in depth in Bhatia (2007) . In particular,  these elements  of 
these matrices  do not distribute  freely in Euclidean  space but instead  live 
on the manifold  of positive  deﬁnite  (PD) matrices  ℙ 𝑁𝑐 and are restricted  
2 Empirical  multivariate  transformations  can achieve this objective  
( Biscay Lirio et al., 1989 ), but they are time-consuming  and not natural.

to a hyper-dimensional  cone ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; Barachant  et al., 
2012 ). This property  induces  dependencies  among the elements  of each 
matrix,  hence the nonlinear  nature of the underlying  manifold.  The 
curved nature of this manifold  precludes  the use of simple Euclidean  
distances  to quantify  distances  between  cross-spectra,  impeding  the cal- 
culation  of the usual norms and distances  of previously  involved  in 
normative  qEEG. Fortunately,  ℙ 𝑁𝑐 endowed  with the aﬃne invariant  
metric, is a complete  diﬀerentiable  Riemannian  manifold  ( Bhatia, 2007 ; 
Congedo  et al., 2017 ). 
In more detail, each point 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) on the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 is associated  with a 
local Euclidean  vector space, known as the tangent  space, denoted  
as 𝑇 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ℙ 𝑁𝑐 . Each tangent  space has a smoothly  varying  inner prod- 
uct, which deﬁnes the Riemannian  metric locally ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; 
Barachant  et al., 2012 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ). We use two operators  to 
pass from the manifold  to the tangent  space and back. The logarithmic  
mapping  projects  the 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) to the tangent  space 𝑇 𝐂 ℙ 𝑁𝑐 with respect to 
a reference  (centering)  matrix 𝐂 ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ), 
Lo g 𝐜 (𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) )= 𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
= 𝐂 1∕2 logm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )𝐂 1∕2 
where logm denotes  matrix logarithm  3 . Furthermore,  the inverse  oper- 
ator of logarithm  mapping  projects  the tangent  vector to the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 man- 
ifold with the exponential  mapping,  
Exp 𝐜 (𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) )= 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 
= 𝐂 1∕2 expm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐐 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )𝐂 1∕2 
where expm is the matrix exponential.  
Thus, we can apply Euclidean  calculations  by transforming  the orig- 
inal curved ℙ 𝑁𝑐 manifold  to the tangent  space where we assume  that 
locally Gaussianity  holds ( Pennec,  1999 ). We achieve  this transforma-  
tion by the “Riemannian  vectorization  ” operator  ( Pennec  et al., 2006 ; 
Congedo  et al., 2017 ; Sabbagh  et al., 2020 ) on cross-spectral  matrices,  
which produce  the vector 𝜽𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) with the transformation  of the space 
ℙ 𝑁𝑐 →ℂ 𝑁𝑚 . 
𝛉𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) = vech [logm (𝐂 −1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 −1∕2 )](4) 
which is known as a parallel  transport  on the ℙ 𝑁𝑐 manifold.  Selec- 
tion of the matrix 𝐂 is crucial,  and a typical choice is to select it 
3 For matrix 𝐀 ∈ℙ 𝑛 , if the eigen decomposition  of 𝐀 is 𝐀 = 𝐔𝐋 𝐔 𝐻 , logm ( 𝐀 ) = 
𝐔 diag ( log ( 𝑙 1 ) , …, log ( 𝑙 𝑛 ) ) 𝐔 𝐻 and expm ( 𝐀 ) = 𝐔 diag ( exp ( 𝑙 1 ) , …, exp ( 𝑙 𝑛 ) ) 𝐔 𝐻 . to whiten a given 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , that is, to minimize  ‖𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) − 𝐈 Nc ‖2 
𝐹 . For sev- 
eral 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , we need to center the whole sample with a single 𝐂 , so 
that statistical  calculations  are carried out in a common  tangent  space 
( Arsigny  et al., 2005 ; Barachant  et al., 2013 ; Ng et al., 2016a ). This 
objective  is best achieved  when 𝐂 is closest in some sense to all 
the 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ( Hauberg  et al., 2013 ; Ng et al., 2016a ). If we have rea- 
son to believe  that 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) are already  whitened,  then 𝐂 = 𝐈 𝑁𝑐 , which 
is precisely  the Log-Euclidean  approach  to Eq. (4) ( Barachant  et al., 
2013 ; Ng et al., 2016b ). Nevertheless,  there is consensus  that the 
optimal  mean is 𝐶 = 𝐺( 𝑠 1 ( 𝜔 ) , ..., 𝑠 𝑁𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ) where the function  𝐺is the 
Karcher  mean ( Bhatia and Holbrook,  2006 ; Karcher,  1977 ), also known 
as the Riemannian  or geometric  mean ( Moakher,  2005 ; Bhatia and 
Holbrook,  2006 ). Also see ( Tuzel et al., 2008 ; Barachant  et al., 
2012 ; Congedo  et al., 2017 ). The estimation  of the Karcher  mean 
is highly nonlinear  and must be calculated  using iterative  methods.  
In particular,  we use the software  implemented  by Bini and Ian- 
nazzo (2013) ( http://bezout.dm.unipi.it/software/mmtoolbox/  ) based 
on the Richardson-like  iteration.  Further  details about the Riemannian  
geometric  mean calculation  are in Appendix  B.1 . We emphasize  that 
though the calculation  of the matrix 𝐂 is highly nonlinear,  the appli- 
cation of the centering  operation  𝐂 − 1∕2 𝐒 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐂 − 1∕2 is easily shown to be 
linear.

ALS participants  were recruited  through  the University  of Michigan  
ALS clinic and had been diagnosed  as having probable  or deﬁnite  ALS 
per the El Escorial  Criteria  ( Brooks,  1994 ). The project was approved  by 
the University  of Michigan  Institutional  Review  Board (HUM00000219).  
All participants  gave written  informed  consent  before participation.  
Healthy  controls  were recruited  from the local community  through  com- 
munity  advertising  and were balanced  on age. Participants  underwent  
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) at multiple  research  visits. For con- 
venience  for the ALS participants,  research  visits were scheduled  to co- 
incide with clinical  visits. Visits were scheduled  at roughly  3-month  in- 
tervals while minimizing  travel burden to participants  with ALS. Par- 
ticipants  with ALS continued  into the study until they could no longer 
tolerate  the MRI session,  decided  on their own accord to no longer par- 
ticipate,  or passed away. The sample used for analysis  included  190 
scanning  visits from 16 ALS participants  (78 visits) and 22 HC partici-  
pants (112 visits). ALS patient demographics  are given in Table 1 . The 
number  of visits per participant  ranged from 3 to 10 (median  = 4.5, 
mean = 5). Participants’  visit timing is shown in Supplementary  Fig. A1. 
Healthy  control participant  demographics  are given in Supplementary  
Table A1. 
At the time of each scanning  visit, ALS participants  had function  
assessed  with the ALS Functional  Rating Scale (revised)  (ALSFRS-R),  a 
standard  instrument  that is widely used in clinical  care and clinical  re- 
search ( Rooney  et al., 2017 ). ALSFRS-R  scores range from 48 (no impair-  
ment) to 0 (total impairment).  Fig. 1 displays  ALSFRS-R  trajectories  for 
each ALS participant  in the study, and Supplementary  Table A2 shows 
ALSFRS-R  scores at the ﬁrst and last visit for each participant.  All but 
two participants  had ALSFRS-R  scores over 35 at the ﬁrst visit, indicating  
a relatively  mild disease  state. Fig. 1 shows that many ALS participants  
experienced  wide range of disability  levels through  the course of the 
study.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11668, 11673), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2221, 2227), match='\n2.2. '>"

Twenty-two  native German  speakers  (mean age: 27.9 years; SD: 2.75

All participants  reported  normal  hearing,  and no history of neurological

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119136,"2.1. Description  of RETROICOR  
RETROICOR  is a commonly  used physiologic  noise correction  
method  that includes  two steps: 1) modeling  physiologic  signals re- 
ﬂected in the image domain  and 2) regression  of physiologic  signals 
from the time series data. Here, we use the term “RETROICOR  model ”
to indicate  the Fourier  series expansion  of the physiologic  signal compo-  
nent based on the deﬁned  cardiac  and respiratory  phases,  as described  
below. 
Using signals from a pulse plethysmograph  and respiratory  belt, the 
cardiac  phase is linearly  deﬁned  from 0 to 2 𝜋between  successive  R- 
wave peaks ( Hu et al., 1995 ), and the respiratory  phase is deﬁned  in the 
range of - 𝜋to 𝜋across each respiration  cycle, i.e. in-/exhalation,  based 
on the histogram-equalized  transfer  function  which considers  the breath 
depth ( Glover et al., 2000 ). After synchronizing  the relative  cardiac  and 
respiratory  phases to slice acquisition  time, the multi-order  harmonic  
Fourier  series of each physiologic  noise component  is expanded  with 
the corresponding  phases in each slice acquisition  time: 
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑀 ∑
𝑚 =1 ( 𝑎 𝑐,𝑚 cos (𝑚 𝜑 𝑐 )+ 𝑏 𝑐,𝑚 sin (𝑚 𝜑 𝑐 )+ 𝑎 𝑟,𝑚 cos (𝑚 𝜑 𝑟 )
+ 𝑏 𝑟,𝑚 sin (𝑚 𝜑 𝑟 )) (1) 
where subscripts  c and r represent  cardiac  and respiratory  data, respec- 
tively, and 𝜑 𝑐,𝑟 is the corresponding  phase at time t. RETROICOR  is ex- 
pected to account  for this cardiac  sine harmonic  shift through  the use 
of voxelwise  Fourier  series expansion.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11286, 11291), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1525, 1531), match='\n2.2. '>"

Two older adult brain MRI datasets  were used in this work. Dataset  1 
was used for constructing  the new high resolution  T1w template.  Dataset  
1 consisted  of T1w brain MRI data collected  on 222 community-based  
non-demented  older adults (65–95 age-range,  mean ± sd age = 80.1 ± 8.3 
years, 50% female)  participating  in the Rush Memory  and Aging Project 
( Bennett  et al., 2018 ). All participants  signed an informed  consent  ac- 
cording  to procedures  approved  by the institutional  review board of 
Rush University  Medical  Center.  T1w data were collected  on a 3 Tesla 
(T) Siemens  scanner  for 171 participants  and on a 3 T Philips scanner  
for 51 participants  using a 3D magnetization  prepared  rapid acquisition  
gradient  echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  with the following  parameters:  3 T 
Siemens  scanner:  TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, 
ﬁeld of view = 256 mm x 256 mm, 176 slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 
mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 2; 3 T Philips scanner:  TR = 8 ms, 
TE = 3.7 ms, TI = 955 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 8°, ﬁeld of view = 240 mm x 228 mm, 181 slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor 
of 2. 
Dataset  2 was used ﬁrst to construct  a study-speciﬁc  template  and 
then to evaluate  the performance  of the diﬀerent  templates  considered  
in this work. Dataset  2 consisted  of T1w brain MRI data collected  on 222 
non-demented  older adults (65-95 age-range,  mean ± sd age = 80.1 ± 5.7 
years, 50% female)  participating  in the Alzheimer’s  Disease  Neuroimag-  
ing Initiative  3 (ADNI3)  (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).  ADNI was launched  
in 2003 as a public-private  partnership,  led by Dr. Michael  W. Weiner  
to investigate  whether  serial MRI, positron  emission  tomography  (PET), 
other biological  markers,  and clinical  and neuropsychological  assess- 
ment can be combined  to measure  the progression  of mild cognitive  
impairment  and early Alzheimer’s  disease.  T1w data were collected  on 
a 3 T Siemens  scanner  for 163 individuals  and on a 3 T Philips scan- 
ner for 59 individuals  using 3D MPRAGE  sequences  with the follow- 
ing parameters:  3 T Siemens  scanner:  TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, 
TI = 900 ms, ﬂip ‐angle = 9°, ﬁeld of view = 256 mm ×240 mm, 208 
slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 
2; 3 T Philips scanner:  TR = 6.5 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI = 900 ms,

The patient data were divided  into two separate  cohorts  based on 
the two studied  tracers:  [ 11 C]PiB and [ 18 F]FE-PE2I.  The ﬁrst cohort con- 
tained patients  referred  for clinically  uncertain  AD according  to the ap- 
propriate  use criteria  for amyloid  PET imaging  ( Johnson  et al., 2013 ). A 
total of 162 patients  underwent  PET/CT  between  May 2019 and October  
2021. The patients  were between  48 and 88 years old, with a mean age of 68.5 ± 7.7 years old. The second cohort contained  509 patients  re- 
ferred for clinically  uncertain  PD ( Morbelli  et al., 2020 ) and underwent  
PET/CT  between  August 2018 and October  2021. The patients  of this co- 
hort were between  22 and 90 years old, with a mean age of 71.5 ± 10.1 
years old. 
All patients  included  in the dataset gave informed  consent  for imag- 
ing to be performed  as part of their diagnostic  work-up.  This study was 
performed  according  to the Danish legislation  as a quality assurance  
study with permission  from the hospital  administration.  The need for 
explicit  written  consent  was not required  according  to regulations  since 
the study operated  exclusively  on anonymized  retrospective  data. To 
comply  with legal requirements,  all data were fully anonymized  upon 
collection  from the clinical  archives  in compliance  with General  Data

Three groups of participants  (ET, tremor dominant  PD and healthy  
controls)  were included  in this study. The monocenter  study was con- 
ducted at the Amsterdam  UMC, location  Academic  Medical  Center.  All 
participants  were 18 years of age or older and right hand dominant.  The 
ET patients  were diagnosed  according  to criteria  deﬁned  by the Tremor  
Investigation  group ( Bain et al., 2000 ). Eighteen  propranolol-sensitive  
ET patients  were included,  with familial  bilateral  postural  arm tremor.  
Tremor  severity  was assessed  using the TETRAS  scale ( Elble et al., 2012 ). 
Fourteen  PD patients  with rest tremor were included  and were diag- 
nosed without  severe motor ﬂuctuations  and severe dyskinesia,  accord-  ing to the UK Brain Bank Criteria  ( Bain et al., 2000 ). Tremor  severity  
was assessed  using the UPDRS  scale part III ( Goetz et al., 2008 ). All clin- 
ical evaluations  were recorded  on video and scored blindly by an expe- 
rienced  neurologist.  To rule out the eﬀects of medication,  both groups 
were asked to temporarily  stop or reduce anti-tremor  medication  at least 
three days before recording  according  to individualized  schemes.  Fur- 
thermore,  eighteen  healthy  controls  with no history of familial  tremor 
or neurological  disorders  participated.  The study protocol  was approved  
by the medical–ethical  board of the Academic  Medical  Center,  Amster-  
dam, according  to the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Informed  written  consent  
was obtained  from each subject prior to participation.  Seven partici-  
pants (three ET patients,  one PD patient,  and three healthy  controls)  
were excluded  because  of technical  issues, leaving  15 ET patients,  13 
PD patients  and 15 healthy  controls  for ﬁnal analyses.  For more details,

By design, CNNs excel at extracting  task-speciﬁc  descriptors  of high- 
dimensional  3D image data. Here, our aim is to use an existing  CNN

leverage  this complementary  information  for improved  prediction.  Com-

Fig. 1. Overview  of the proposed  network  architecture.  A: The backbone  of our proposed  network  architecture  is a ResNet, where the Dynamic  Aﬃne Feature Map 
Transform  (DAFT) is applied in the last residual  block. B: For each instance  𝑖 in a batch, the DAFT ﬁrst squeezes  the spatial dimensions  of a feature map 𝐅 𝑖 of size 
𝐶 ×𝐷 ×𝐻 ×𝑊 via global average pooling.  Next, the resulting  vector is concatenated  with the vector 𝐱 𝑖 ∈ℝ 𝑃 of tabular information.  The result is fed to a set of 
fully-connected  layers with intermediate  ReLU activation  that compress  the feature vector by a factor 𝑟 (throughout  this work, we use 𝑟 = 7 ). The output is a vector 
of scales 𝜶𝑖 ∈ℝ 𝐶 , and oﬀsets 𝜷𝑖 ∈ℝ 𝐶 , which are used to aﬃnely transform  the input feature maps 𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 , yielding  𝐅 ′
𝑖,𝑐 ( 𝑐 = 1 , …, 𝐶). C: A standard  ResBlock  with 
down-sampling  via strided convolutions.  If the number of input feature maps equals the number of output feature maps, no downsampling  is performed  and the 
residual  connection  contains  no convolutional  nor batch norm layer. 
mon tabular  information,  such as demographics  or aggregate  statistics,  
describe  the patient’s  state holistically,  thus, a level exchange  of infor- 
mation between  image and tabular  data is required.  Since early layers 
of a CNN typically  describe  rather primitive  concepts  (e.g. edges, blobs), 
we propose  to transform  the feature maps of a 3D convolutional  layer 
that appears  late in the CNN and captures  broad concepts  in the image. 
We select a ResNet ( He et al., 2016 ) as the backbone  of our approach,  
as it is the most common  backbone  architecture  used in previous  work. 
We propose  to dynamically  scale and shift the feature maps of a 3D 
convolutional  layer in the last residual  block, conditional  on a patient’s  
brain MRI and clinical  tabular  information.  Our full network  design is 
summarized  in Fig. 1 . 
Formally,  let 𝐱 𝑖 ∈ℝ 𝑃 denote the tabular  clinical  information  for the 
𝑖 th instance  in the dataset and 𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 ∈ℝ 𝐷×𝐻×𝑊 the 𝑐th output (feature  
map) of a 3D convolutional  layer based on the 𝑖 th volumetric  image 
( 𝑐 ∈{ 1 , …, 𝐶} and 𝑃 denotes  the number  of tabular  features,  𝐷, 𝐻, 𝑊 
the depth, height, and width of the feature map). The ability to incite 
or repress high-level  concepts  learned  from the image is achieved  by 
conditioning  the outputs  𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 of a convolutional  layer on the image and tabular  data. For this purpose,  the Dynamic  Aﬃne Feature  Map Trans- 
form (DAFT)  learns to predict scale 𝛼𝑖,𝑐 and oﬀset 𝛽𝑖,𝑐 : 
𝐅 ′
𝑖,𝑐 = 𝛼𝑖,𝑐 𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 + 𝛽𝑖,𝑐 , (1) 
𝛼𝑖,𝑐 = 𝑓 𝑐 ( 𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 , 𝐱 𝑖 ) , 𝛽𝑖,𝑐 = 𝑔 𝑐 ( 𝐅 𝑖,𝑐 , 𝐱 𝑖 ) , (2) 
where 𝑓 𝑐 , 𝑔 𝑐 are arbitrary  mappings  from image and tabular  space to a 
scalar. In our work, a single auxiliary  neural network  ℎ 𝑐 models 𝑓 𝑐 , 𝑔 𝑐 
and outputs  a single 
𝜶− 𝜷
-pair, which is referred  to as DAFT, visually  represented  in Fig. 1 B. 
First, DAFT creates a bottleneck  via global average  pooling  of the 
spatial dimensions  of the image feature map. Next, the resulting  vec- 
tor is concatenated  with the tabular  data. This combined  vector is 
squeezed  by an FC layer with a bottleneck  and fed through  a ReLU 
non-linearity  ( Nair and Hinton,  2010 ). A second FC layer expands  the 
squeezed  vector and yields the output vectors  𝜶𝑖 and 𝜷𝑖 ; motivated  
3  T.N. Wolf, S. Pölsterl and C. Wachinger  NeuroImage  260 (2022) 119505 
by Hu et al. (2020) , we do not add bias terms to FC layers in the aux- 
iliary network.  In addition,  we allow applying  a non-linear  activation  
function  𝜎( ⋅) to 𝛼𝑖,𝑐 , such that the scaling factors can be restricted  to a 
particular  domain  (e.g. [0; 1] for sigmoid  activation).  In our experiments,  
we explore  three options:  linear, sigmoid  and tanh. 
As the proposed  DAFT does not depend  on the number  of instances  in 
the dataset,  nor the spatial resolution  of the feature map, it is computa-  
tionally  eﬃcient.  Due to parameter  sharing,  DAFT is able to dynamically  
scale (via 𝛼𝑖,𝑐 ) and shift (via 𝛽𝑖,𝑐 ) feature maps of a convolutional  layer, 
conditional  on the speciﬁc  image and tabular  information  of the 𝑖 th pa- 
tient. Moreover,  our proposed  DAFT is a versatile  module  that can be 
eﬀortlessly  applied  to any type of CNN to fuse tabular  information,  not 
just the CNN in Fig. 1 A, which we demonstrate  in Section  4.6 .",\n?Resource | \n?3\.1\.\s*?\n?,"<re.Match object; span=(14108, 14114), match=' \n3.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(4929, 4934), match='\n3.2.'>"

tracted from the naturalistic  stimuli fMRI data using an open-access  par- 
cellation  scheme  derived  from independent  component  analysis  (ICA) 
of resting state fMRI; next, the time courses  from all participants  are 
stacked  to construct  a third-order  fMRI tensor; last, TCA is applied  to 
estimate  spatio-temporal  patterns  and their corresponding  subject load- 
ings. 
In the ﬁrst step, rather than applying  TCA to voxel-wise  fMRI data, a 
whole brain parcellation  scheme  is applied  to extract node time courses  
for the TCA. This is done for several reasons.  First, BOLD signals are 
expected  to be correlated  across neighboring  voxels and, with an ap- 
propriate  parcellation  method,  node time courses  will have a higher 
signal noise ratio (SNR) compared  with the SNR of time courses  from 
dense data ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). Parcellation  schemes  based on ICA of 
fMRI data with high model orders ( > 100 to several hundred)  will be comprised  of components  that feature individual  small brain regions,  
bilateral  brain regions,  or sparse sub-networks  that may have regions  
overlapping  other components  (e.g., reﬂecting  hubs such as posterior  
cingulate  cortex),  and can thus be considered  as nodes for use in net- 
work analysis  ( Smith, 2012 ). Several  studies have demonstrated  that 
brain parcellation  with spatial ICA demonstrates  better performance  for 
network  modeling  compared  with other parcellation  methods  (Smith 
et al., 2011; Arslan et al., 2018), with higher model orders providing  
better performance  ( Pervaiz  et al., 2020 ). In this study, a brain par- 
cellation  scheme  derived  from ICA of the Human  Connectome  Project 
(HCP, Van Essen et al., (2013) ) resting state fMRI data with model or- 
der of 300 (provided  by the HCP, Smith et al., 2011) is used to ex- 
tract node time courses  for TCA. The time courses  are extracted  via 
the ﬁrst stage of dual regression  ( Nickerson  et al., 2017 ) in which the 
3  G. Hu, H. Li, W. Zhao et al. NeuroImage  255 (2022) 119193 
full set of ICA components,  𝐒 ICA , are regressed  against  each partici-  
pant’s 4D fMRI data (e.g., multivariate  spatial regression)  to extract the 
time courses.  This is diﬀerent  from how conventional  binary parcella-  
tion masks are used to extract average  time courses  from each node 
in that the multivariate  spatial regression  accurately  handles  any po- 
tential spatial overlap  among the ICA maps due to individual  brain re- 
gions participating  in more than one brain network  (or sub-network)  
represented  in the ICA maps. The analysis  code for the tensor compo-  
nent analysis  framework  is available  at https://github.com/GHu-DUT/  
Tensor-  components-  analysis-  for- naturalistic-  stimuli-  fMRI . 
2.1.1. Multilinear  mixing model 
For naturalistic  fMRI we assume,  similar to the ISC model ( Finn et al., 
2020 ; Nastase  et al., 2019 ), that time courses  𝐂 ∈ℝ N ×J and spatial 
patterns  𝐒 ∈ℝ M ×J of nodes in the parcellation  are stimulus-evoked  re- 
sponses  that are consistent  across subject.  N is the number  of timepoints,  
J is the number  of patterns,  M is the number  of nodes. Thus, in our TCA- 
based model, for each pattern  𝑗, the loading  𝝈𝑖,𝑗 for subject 𝑖 is diﬀerent  
from other subjects.  In this case, for subject 𝑖 , the node time courses,  
𝐗 𝑖 ∈ℝ M ×N , can be represented  as: 
𝐗 𝑖 = 𝐒 ×𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠 (𝝈𝑖, ∶ )×𝐂 𝑇 + 𝐈 𝐝 𝑖 + 𝜺 𝑖 , (1) 
where 𝐈 𝐝 𝑖 are stimulus-evoked  responses  that are idiosyncratic  to each 
subject and 𝜺 𝑖 corresponds  to noise, which may reﬂect spontaneous  neu- 
ral activity  and non-neural  physiological  and scanner  signal sources.  
𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠 ( 𝝈𝑖, ∶ ) is a square matrix of order J with 𝝈𝑖, ∶ on the diagonal  and 
other elements  of the matrix equal to zero. 
2.1.2. Tensor construction  
A tensor is constructed  by stacking  the multi-subject  data, 𝐗 𝑖 , to cre- 
ate 𝐗 ∈ℝ M ×I ×N , with I equal to the total number  of subjects.  Although  
the spatial and temporal  patterns  are assumed  to be shared across partic- 
ipants, the loadings  on the components  in each participant  are diﬀerent.  
Of note, the model also does not place any assumptions  on the distribu-  
tion of time courses  or spatial distributions.  
2.1.3. TCA unmixing  model 
TCA is a basic model for tensor decomposition  that is unconstrained.  
With diﬀerent  constraints,  diﬀerent  algorithms  can be derived,  includ- 
ing non-negative  canonical  polyadic  decomposition  (NCPD)  ( Zhou et al., 
2014 ) and independent  constrained  CPD (e.g. tensor-ICA  Beckmann  and 
Smith, 2005 ). In the TCA model, a third-order  tensor 𝐗 can be rep- 
resented  as the sum of several rank-1 tensors and a residual  tensor 𝐄 
( Hitchcock,  1927 ), which is illustrated  in Fig.1 (C). The mathematical  
formula  is as follow: 
𝐗 = 𝑅 ∑
𝑟 =1 ̂𝐬 𝑟 ◦̂𝝈𝑟 ◦̂𝐜 𝑟 + 𝐄 = 𝑅 ∑
𝑟 =1 𝐗 𝑟 + 𝐄 , (2) 
where vectors  ̂𝐬 𝑟 ∈ℝ M ×1 , ̂𝝈𝑟 ∈ℝ I ×1 and ̂𝐜 𝑟 ∈ℝ N ×1 are 𝑟 𝑡ℎ estimated  
tensor component  (TC) spatial distribution  𝐒 , subject loadings  𝝈and 
time courses  𝐂 respectively.  The operator  ◦represents  the outer product  
of vectors.  𝐗 𝑟 represents  the rank-1 tensor that constructed  by the corre- 
sponding  components  of each mode. The idiosyncratic  stimulus-evoked  
responses,  spontaneous  signals and noise signals are contained  in the 
residual  tensor 𝐄 and 𝑅 is the number  of extracted  patterns.  Ideally,  the 
number  of tensor components,  or model order, should be equivalent  to 
the number  of patterns,  J , shared across subjects.  However,  in real-world  
applications,  the number  of spatio-temporal  patterns  is unknown.  In the 
present  study, we propose  a novel method  for determining  model order 
according  to stability  of tensor spectral  clustering.  Once a solution  is 
identiﬁed,  for each tensor component,  the spatial distributions  are ̂𝐬 𝑟 , 
time courses  are ̂𝐜 𝑟 . These are the same across subjects,  with subject 
loadings,  ̂𝝈𝑟 , reﬂecting  between-subject  variation  in the strength  of the 
patterns.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14631, 14636), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(6821, 6826), match='2.2. '>"

Two older adult brain MRI datasets  were used in this work. Dataset  
1 was used for constructing  multimodal  T 1 w and DTI templates.  
Dataset  1 consisted  of structural  T 1 w and diﬀusion  data from 202 non- 
demented  older adults (50% male; 65.2–94.9  years age range; mean ± sd 
age = 80.56 ± 8.14 years of age; 161 with no cognitive  impairment  and 
41 with mild cognitive  impairment)  participating  in the Rush Memory  
and Aging Project (MAP) ( Bennett  et al., 2018 ). All participants  pro- 
vided written  informed  consent  according  to procedures  approved  by 
the institutional  committee  for the protection  of human subjects.  Pre- 
vious work has shown that this number  of participants  is suﬃciently  
large to generate  an unbiased  and robust brain template  ( Ridwan  et al., 
2021 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). All data were collected  on a 3T Siemens  
(158 persons)  and a 3T Philips MRI scanner  (44 persons).  T 1 w im- 
ages were acquired  using a 3D magnetization  prepared  rapid acquisi-  
tion gradient  echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  with the following  parameters:  
for 3T Siemens,  TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, 
ﬁeld of view = 256 mm x 256 mm, 176 sagittal  slices, acquired  voxel 
size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 2; for 3T Philips,  
TR = 8 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, TI = 955 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 8°, ﬁeld of view = 240 mm 
x 228 mm, 181 sagittal  slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , 
and an acceleration  factor of 2. The diﬀusion  data were acquired  us- 
ing a spin-echo-planar  diﬀusion-weighted  imaging  sequence  with the 
following  parameters:  for 3T Siemens,  TR = 8100 ms, TE = 85 ms, ﬁeld of 
view = 224 mm x 224 mm, 65 axial slices, voxel size = 2 ×2 ×2 mm 3 , 
b = 1000s/mm  2 for 40 diﬀusion  directions,  and six b = 0 s/mm 2 images;

for 3T Philips,  TR = 10,701 ms, TE = 55 ms, and all other parameters  were 
the same. 
Dataset  2 was used for assessing  spatial normalization  precision  
when using the templates  generated  by the diﬀerent  methods  as ref- 
erence.  Dataset  2 consisted  of T 1 w and DTI data from 202 non- 
demented  older adults (50% male; 65–93.2  years age range; mean ± sd 
age = 78.3 ± 6.02 years of age; 122 with no cognitive  impairment  and 
80 with mild cognitive  impairment)  participating  in the Alzheimer’s  
Disease  Neuroimaging  Initiative  3 (ADNI3)  (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).  
ADNI was launched  as a public-private  partnership  in 2003, led by Prin- 
cipal Investigator  Michael  W. Weiner,  MD. The primary  goal of ADNI has 
been to test whether  serial MRI, positron  emission  tomography  (PET), 
other biological  markers,  and clinical  and neuropsychological  assess- 
ment can be combined  to measure  the progression  of mild cognitive  
impairment  and early Alzheimer’s  disease.  All data in Dataset  2 were 
collected  on 3T Siemens  (146 persons)  and 3T Philips (56 persons)  MRI 
scanners.  T 1 w images were obtained  using 3D MPRAGE  sequences  with 
the following  parameters:  for 3T Siemens,  TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, 
TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, ﬁeld of view = 256 mm x 240 mm, 208 slices, 
acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , and an acceleration  factor of 2; for 
3T Philips,  TR = 6.5 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip-angle  = 9°, ﬁeld of 
view = 256 mm x 256 mm, 211 slices, acquired  voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 , 
and an acceleration  factor of 2. DTI data were acquired  using spin-echo-  
planar diﬀusion-weighted  sequences  with the following  parameters:  for 
Siemens  Skyra E11 (101 persons),  TR = 9600 ms, TE = 82.0 ms, ﬁeld of 
view = 232 mm x 232 mm, 80 axial slices, voxel size = 2 ×2 ×2 mm 3 , 
b = 1000s/mm  2 for 48 diﬀusion  directions,  and seven b = 0 s/mm 2 im-

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119024,"Introduction  
As we navigate  the world, we are bombarded  by more sensory  in- 
formation  than we can process  and respond  to. One of the brain’s most 
important  tasks, therefore,  is to focus on the most relevant  information  
while ignoring  the rest. Whereas  the eye can be directed  to point at and 
focus on regions  of visual space, this mechanical  strategy  is generally  
not available  to the human auditory  system.  Instead,  it must use neural 
mechanisms  to segregate  acoustic  information  into sources  or ’streams’,  
select one stream,  and then actively  attend to that stream to extract 
task-relevant  information  ( Shinn-Cunningham,  2008 ; Holt et al., 2018 ). 
What neural strategies  might the listener  use to focus in on and track 
a task-relevant  stream?  One possibility  is to ﬁlter auditory  streams  based 
on acoustic  dimensions  along which they diﬀer. For example,  if one 
stream lies in a higher frequency  band than the other, listeners  could 
selectively  attend to that stream by directing  attention  to a particular  
frequency  band (spectrally-selective  attention;  Paltoglou  et al., 2009 ; 
Fritz et al., 2012 ; Da Costa et al., 2013 ; Dick et al., 2017 ; Riecke et al., 
2017 ). Another  possible  strategy  is to take advantage  of timing or rhyth- 
mic diﬀerences  between  streams,  so that attention  can be directed  to 
time points likely to contain  the to-be-attended  stream and less likely to 
contain  the to-be-ignored  stream ( Nobre and van Ede, 2018 ). 
That listeners  make use of temporally-selective  attention  to select 
sound streams  for further processing  is supported  by ﬁndings  that tem-

boost performance  on attention  tasks. When target stimuli are presented  
among distractors,  prior knowledge  about target timing onsets has been 
shown to boost tone detection  ( Bonino and Leibold,  2008 ), birdsong  
identiﬁcation  ( Best et al., 2007 ), word recognition  ( Gatehouse  and 
Akeroyd,  2008 ), and speech comprehension  ( Kitterick  et al., 2010 ). 
Moreover,  when speaking,  talkers modulate  the temporal  characteristics  
of speech to minimize  overlap  with background  speech,  thus allowing  
listeners  to use such a temporally-selective  strategy  to understand  what 
the speaker  is saying ( Cooke and Lu, 2010 ). 
How might the brain carry out such temporally-selective  attention?  
One possibility  is that brain activity  “entrains  ”to the attended  stream,  
such that endogenous  neural oscillations  phase-lock  to its temporal  
structure  ( Schroeder  and Lakatos,  2009 ). 1 Indeed,  when non-human  pri- 
mates attend to one stream in an inter-modal  attention  task, slow neu- 
ral activity  aligns with the temporal  structure  of the attended  stream 
( Lakatos  et al., 2008 ). Similarly,  in humans,  attention  to alternating  au- 
ditory versus visual stimuli is linked to a shift in phase of 180°in a slow 
modulation  of neural activity  at the within-modality  presentation  rate 
( Besle et al., 2011 ). 
This endogenous  oscillation  hypothesis  has inﬂuenced  a large body 
of cognitive  neuroscience  research  on selective  attention.  However,  
most of this research  has not directly  examined  the exact form of the 
1 In recent years the term ""neural entrainment""  has been sometimes  used more 
broadly to refer to any regular temporal  relationship  between  the rhythmic  
structure  of a stimulus  and a neural response,  regardless  of whether  this relation-  
ship reﬂects the inﬂuence  of endogenous  oscillations;  see below for a discussion.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118822,"2.1. Distributed  ComBat  
ComBat  ( Fortin et al., 2018; 2017; Johnson  et al., 2007 ) seeks to 
remove  scanner  eﬀects in the mean and variance  of neuroimaging  data 
in an empirical  Bayes framework.  To handle the distributed  data set- 
ting, we propose  d-ComBat  as an algorithm  that yields adjusted  data 
identical  to the original  ComBat  method.  Let 𝒚 ij = ( 𝑦 ij 1 , 𝑦 ij 2 , …, 𝑦 ijV ) 𝑇 , 
𝑖 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝐾, 𝑗 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑛 𝑖 denote the 𝑉 -dimensional  vectors  of ob- 
served data where 𝑖 indexes  scanner,  𝑗indexes  subjects  within scanners,  
𝑛 𝑖 is the number  of subjects  acquired  on scanner  𝑖 , and 𝑉 is the number  
of features.  For simplicity,  we assume  each site uses a diﬀerent  scanner  
and the data are collected  from 𝐾sites. However,  our algorithm  could 
be easily extended  to allow varying  number  of scanners  per site. Our 
goal is to harmonize  the data from these 𝑁 = ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑛 𝑖 subjects  across 
the 𝐾scanners  without  pooling  data at a single processing  site. ComBat  
assumes  that the 𝑉 features  𝑣 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑉 follow 
𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑣 = 𝛼𝑣 + 𝒙 𝑇 
𝑖𝑗 𝜷𝑣 + 𝛾𝑖𝑣 + 𝛿𝑖𝑣 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣, (1) 
where 𝛼𝑣 is the intercept,  𝒙 𝑖𝑗 is the vector of covariates,  𝜷𝑣 is the vector of 
regression  coeﬃcients,  𝛾𝑖𝑣 is the mean scanner  eﬀect, and 𝛿𝑖𝑣 is the vari- 
ance scanner  eﬀect. The errors 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣 are assumed  to follow 𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑣 ∼𝑁(0 , 𝜎2 
𝑣 ) . 
The original  ComBat  contains  two steps. The ﬁrst is to standardize  
the original  features  by removing  the covariate  eﬀects and scaling each 
residuals  by its total variance.  The second step involves  estimating  the 
scanner  eﬀects 𝛾and 𝛿using an empirical  Bayes framework  and remov- 
ing them from the original  data. We propose  a distributed  algorithm  for 
each of the two steps in the next two sections.  
Standardization  
The original  implementation  of ComBat  ﬁrst standardizes  the mean 
and variance  of data across scanners  via feature-wise  least-squares  esti- 
mation.  The standardized  data are calculated  as 
𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑣 = 𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − ̂𝛼𝑣 − 𝑋 𝑖𝑗 ̂𝛽𝑣 
̂𝜎𝑣 
However,  in the distributed  setting we do not have direct access to the 
entire dataset and cannot directly  compute  estimates  for the intercepts  
𝛼𝑣 , regression  coeﬃcients  𝜷𝑣 , scanner-speciﬁc  mean shifts 𝛾𝑖𝑣 or popu- 
lation standard  deviations  𝜎𝑣 for each feature.  To address  this problem,  
we propose  an estimation  procedure  that only requires  computation  and 
transmission  of deidentiﬁed  summary  statistics  between  distributed  sites 
and a central location.  As in the original  ComBat  methodology,  estima-  
tion is performed  under the constraint  ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑛 𝑖 ̂𝛾𝑖𝑣 = 0 to ensure identiﬁ-  
ability. 
For each feature,  deﬁne 𝜽𝑣 = ( 𝛼𝑣 , 𝜷𝑇 
𝑣 , 𝛾1 𝑣 , 𝛾2 𝑣 , …, 𝛾𝐾−1 ,𝑣 ) 𝑇 . 
Then we can rewrite  the data across all 𝑁subjects  𝒚 𝑣 = 
( 𝑦 11 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 1 𝑛 1 𝑣 , 𝑦 21 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 2 𝑛 2 𝑣 , …, 𝑦 𝐾𝑛 𝑀 𝑣 ) 𝑇 as 𝒚 𝑣 = 𝑊 𝜽+ 𝑒 𝑣 where 
𝑊 = ⎡

𝑊 𝐾 ⎤

⎥ 
⎥ 
⎥ 
⎥ ⎦ 
The ordinary  least squares  estimate  can be obtained  via ̂𝜽𝑣 = 
( 𝑊 𝑇 𝑊 ) −1 ( 𝑊 𝑇 𝒚 𝑣 ) = ( ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑊 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑊 𝑖 ) −1 ( ∑𝐾 
𝑖 =1 𝑊 𝑖 𝒚 𝑣 ) . By decomposing  the 
estimation  into site-speciﬁc  summary  statistics  𝑊 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑊 𝑖 and 𝑊 𝑖 𝒚 𝑣 , ̂𝜽𝑣 can 
be obtained  by computing  these summary  statistics  and sending  them to 
a central location.  Construction  of 𝑊 𝑖 and calculation  of these summary  
statistics  are simple for 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝐾 − 1 since they are just the usual design matrices  𝑋 𝑖 concatenated  with an intercept  column  and scanner-  
speciﬁc  columns  of ones. To standardize  the variance  of the data, the 
marginal  variance  is estimated  as ̂𝜎2 
𝑣 = 1 
𝑁 ∑
ij ( 𝑦 ijv − ̂𝛼𝑣 − 𝑋 ij ̂𝛽𝑣 − ̂𝛾2 
iv ) , 𝑣 = 
1 , 2 , …, 𝑉 , which is decomposable  by site. 
Empirical  Bayes adjustment  
The key step in ComBat  involves  use of empirical  Bayes estimates  of 
site-speciﬁc  location  and scale parameters  to remove  site eﬀects while 
pooling  information  across features.  ComBat  assumes  that the prior dis- 
tributions  𝛾𝑖𝑣 ∼𝑁( 𝛾𝑖 , 𝜏2 
𝑖 ) and 𝛿2 
𝑖𝑣 ∼Inverse  Gamma  ( 𝜆𝑖 , 𝜈𝑖 ) where hyper- 
parameter  estimates  ̄𝛾𝑖 , ̄𝜏𝑖 , ̄𝜆𝑖 , and ̄𝜈𝑖 are obtained  via method  of mo- 
ments. ComBat  then ﬁnds the conditional  posterior  means 𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 and 𝛿∗ 
𝑖𝑣 , 
computed  iteratively  through  
𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 = 𝑛 𝑖 ̄𝜏2 
𝑖 ̂𝛾𝑖𝑣 + 𝛿2

𝑖𝑣 = ̄𝜈𝑖 + 1 
2 ∑
𝑗 ( 𝑍 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − 𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ) 2 
𝑛 𝑖 
2 + ̄𝜆𝑖 − 1 
Each site’s mean and variance  parameter  estimates  are computed  
from data within that site and so this step is distributed  by its nature. 
The ComBat-adjusted  data is then obtained  within each site via 
𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝐵𝑎𝑡 
𝑖𝑗𝑣 = ̂𝜎𝑣 
𝛿∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ( 𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑣 − ̂𝛾∗ 
𝑖𝑣 ) + ̂𝛼𝑣 + 𝑋 𝑖𝑗 ̂𝛽𝑣 
Algorithm  
In the distributed  setting,  ComBat  only requires  two back-and-forth  
communications  between  sites and a central location  for estimation  of 
the standardization  parameters.  We propose  the d-ComBat  algorithm  
and illustrate  our method  in Fig. 1 . 
1. Initiation  - broadcast  from central site: The central analysis  site 
chooses  identiﬁcation  numbers  for each scanner  and communicates  
these to each location.  
2. Local computation  at collaborative  sites for mean parameters.

Let 𝑋 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) be the brain signal at time 𝑡 on the 𝑖 th brain region of interest  
(ROI), 𝑋 ′
𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) be the derivative  of 𝑋 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) with respect to 𝑡 with 𝑡 ∈[ 0 , 𝑇 ] , 
representing  the increment  of brain activity  at time 𝑡 . Furthermore,  let 
𝑑be the number  of ROIs, we write 𝐗 ( 𝑡 ) = { 𝑋 1 ( 𝑡 ) , …, 𝑋 𝑑 ( 𝑡 )} T , and 𝐗 ′( 𝑡 ) = 
{ 𝑋 ′
1 ( 𝑡 ) , …, 𝑋 ′
𝑑 ( 𝑡 )} T . In practice,  instead  of the true signal, we observe  a 
noisy signal at 𝑛 discrete  acquisition  time points. Denote 𝑡 𝑗 as the 𝑗th 
acquisition  time, to accommodate  the noisy data, we write 
𝐘 𝑗 = 𝐗 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) + 𝝐𝑗 , (1) 
where 𝝐𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1 , …, 𝑛, are independent  mean zero random  errors. Fur- 
thermore,  we assume  
𝐗 ′( 𝑡 𝑗 ) = 𝐀 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) 𝐗 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) , (2)

Two multimodality  kernel examples  are provided  and will be discussed  in Section 2.3.3 . 
where 𝐀 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) is a time-varying  unknown  matrix of size 𝑑 ×𝑑. We name 
model (1) and (2) together  the time-varying  dynamic  network  (TVDN)  
model, where the dynamics  of the resting state functional  connectiv-  
ity are captured  by the time-varying  matrix 𝐀 ( 𝑡 ) . Model (2) is a direct 
extension  of the dynamic  mode decomposition  model ( Brunton  et al., 
2016; Kutz et al., 2016 ). To see the connection,  ﬁrst note that (2) is 
equivalent  to 𝐗 ( 𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 ) = { 𝐀 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 + 𝐈 } 𝐗 ( 𝑡 ) , where 𝑑𝑡 is the unit measure-  
ment time and 𝐈 is an identity  matrix.  When 𝐀 ( 𝑡 ) is a ﬁxed matrix over 
time, we can consider  𝐀 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 + 𝐈 as a constant  matrix.  Then model (2) re- 
duces to the dynamic  mode decomposition  model extensively  studied  in 
Brunton  et al. (2016) and Kutz et al. (2016) . Furthermore,  when 𝐀 ( ⋅) 
is a ﬁxed matrix where 𝐀 ( ⋅) = − 𝛽 , then the model (2) is also a net- 
work diﬀusion  model ( Abdelnour  et al., 2014 ) that explains  how brain 
activations  from diﬀerent  ROIs are coupled  together  to generate  new 
signals via the structural  connectivity  given by the matrix Laplacian   
and the diﬀusivity  constant  𝛽. Other algebraic  graph relationships  have 
also been proposed,  such that 𝐀 may be given by the eigenvectors  of 
the structural  ( Abdelnour  et al., 2018 ) or functional  connectivity  matrix 
( Becker et al., 2018 ), after a suitable  transformation  of the eigenvalues.  
While these approaches  do not readily accommodate  time-varying  fea- 
tures of 𝐀 , they point to an important  property  of the eigenvectors  of 𝐀 , 
which may be considered  as resting state networks  (RSN) ( Abdelnour  
et al., 2018; 2014 ). Because  these RSNs represent  static brain connec-  
tions or other non-dynamic  brain substrates,  we propose  the following  
constraints  that together  constitute  the TVDN model: 
1. The eigen-decomposition  of 𝐀 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) is in the form of 
𝐀 ( 𝑡 𝑗 ) = 𝐔𝚲( 𝑡 𝑗 ) 𝐔 −1 , 
where we ﬁx the eigenvector  𝐔 but allow the eigenvalues  to depend  
on time. Under this formulation,  𝐔 may be considered  as a set of spa- 
tial features  that are stationary  over time. The absolute  magnitudes  
of the (time-varying)  eigenvalues  govern the relative  importance  of 
each of the RSNs. This constraint  reﬂects  the biological  concept  that 
the spatial features  of brain activity  might be stationary,  while the 
coupling  between  these stationary  structures  might be temporally  
dynamic.  
2. We then impose the condition  that dynamicity  in FCs arises from dis- 
crete and potentially  discontinuous  shifts ( “brain state switches  ”) in 
activity,  which we accommodate  by allowing  the eigenvalues,  i.e. di- 
agonal elements  of 𝚲( 𝑡 ) , to be piece-wise  constant  functions  of time , re- 
ﬂecting  the phenomenon  that the brain has a tendency  to stay within,  
with sporadic  cycling  between  the RSNs ( Vidaurre  et al., 2017 ). 
Therefore,  let 𝝉0 = ( 𝜏𝑘 , 𝑘 = 0 , 1 , …, 𝑀, 𝑀 + 1; 𝜏0 = 0 , 𝜏𝑀+1 = 𝑇 ) be a 
set of true switching  points, dividing  the signal to 𝑀 + 1 stationary  segments,  we write 
𝚲( 𝑡 ) = 𝚲( 𝜏𝑘 ) if 𝜏𝑘 −1 < 𝑡 ≤ 𝜏𝑘 , and 𝚲( 𝜏𝑘 ) ≠𝚲( 𝜏𝑘 +1 ) , 𝚲( 𝜏𝑘 ) ≠𝚲( 𝜏𝑘 −1 ) . 
Such formulation  suggests  that when 𝑡 ∈( 𝜏0 𝑘 −1 , 𝜏0 𝑘 ] , 𝚲( 𝑡 ) has a con- 
stant value at 𝚲( 𝜏0 𝑘 ) . And the values of 𝚲( ⋅) are diﬀerent  at distinct  
time points that fall into two consecutive  segments  constructed  by 
the switching  points. 
3. The number  of nonzero  eigenvalues  in 𝚲( 𝑡 ) , 𝑡 ∈[ 0 , 𝑇 ] represents  the 
number  of intrinsic  brain states in the brain activity  data. It is well 
known that only a few RSNs are typically  operational  in the brain, 
and the canonical  RSFC can be well captured  by 7 − 20 such RSNs 
( Yeo et al., 2011 ). In prior graph theoretic  models also, 𝐀 ( ⋅) are as- 
sumed to be low rank matrices  ( Abdelnour  et al., 2018; Raj et al., 
2019 ). It is therefore  plausible  to assert that the number  of such RSNs 
or brain state is quite small. Hence our ﬁnal constraint  is that 
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 { 𝐀 ( 𝑡 )} = 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 { 𝚲( 𝑡 )} ≤ 𝑟 ≪ 𝑑, 
where 𝑟 is the maximal  rank for 𝐀 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑡 ∈[ 0 , 𝑇 ] , representing  the num- 
ber of distinct  brain states.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14142, 14147), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5313, 5319), match='\n2.2. '>"

Results  
Imagery  recall 
A total of 28 adult participants  were assessed  (Suppl.  Table S1). We 
ﬁrst determined  the degree of Imagery  Recall (i.e., presence  or absence  
of imagery)  for the diﬀerent  sleep-wake  stages. Although  Imagery  Re- 
call was quite high across stages, a signiﬁcant  increase  was detected  as 
participants  transited  from WK to N1, as hypothesized  (WK: 75.1 %; 
N1: 87.4 %, N2: 80.4 %, Chi-square  p = 0.0001 for WK vs. N1, other 
comparisons  were not signiﬁcant,  Fig. 2 a). When all trials from WK, 
N1, and N2 were pooled,  Imagery  Recall was related to longer peri- 
ods with eyes closed, in comparison  with ‘No Recall’ trials (Wilcoxon  
Ranksum,  p = 0.0067,  Fig. 2 b). In other words, the longer the partici-  
pants processed  the image with eyes closed, the more likely they were 
to produce  an imagery  report thereafter.  This eﬀect was not detected  
for any speciﬁc  stage (WK p = 0.0862;  N1 p = 0.6881;  N2 p = 0.6583).  
No diﬀerences  related to sleep oscillations  were found between  trials 
with and without  Imagery  Recall (Wilcoxon  Ranksum  p values: Ver- 
tex: N1 = 0.3086,  N2 = 0.8876;  Spindles:  N2 = 0.4178;  K Complexes:  
N2 = 0.6372).  
Image and aﬀect residue 
To characterize  the ‘day residue’  within each stage, Image Residue  
and Aﬀect Residue  were compared  with their corresponding  random-  
ized values. Image Residue  values were higher than random  levels across 
stages (Wilcoxon  Ranksum,  p < 0.0001 for the three stages considered,  
Fig. 2 c, Suppl. Table S3), while Aﬀect Residue  values were similar to 
random  values for WK and N1, and lower than random  levels at N2 
(Wilcoxon  Ranksum,  p < 0.0001,  Fig. 2 c, Suppl. Table S3). Next, we 
evaluated  whether  the Image or Aﬀect Residues  diﬀered  signiﬁcantly  
across stages. This occurred  only for Aﬀect Residue  (Kruskal-Wallis  
p = 0.0051,  Suppl. Table S2), which was higher in WK trials than in 
N2 trials ( Fig. 2 c, Wilcoxon  Ranksum  p = 0.0010,  Suppl. Table S3). 
Image Residue  showed  no signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  across stages ( Fig. 2 c, 
Suppl. Table S3). Although  there were no Image Residue  diﬀerences  
across stages, exclusively  for N1 there was a signiﬁcant  and positive  
correlation  with time spent with eyes closed (Spearman  Rho = 0.29, 
p < 0.0001,  Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). Interestingly,  also for N1 only there was 
a signiﬁcant  negative  correlation  between  Aﬀect Residue  and time with 
eyes closed (Spearman  Rho = -0.20, p = 0.0033,  Fig. 2 d, Table 1 ). There 
were no signiﬁcant  correlations  between  sleep biomarkers  and either Image or Aﬀect Residues  ( Table 1 ). There were no word count diﬀer- 
ences between  eyes open and eyes closed for stages N1 and N2, but 
there was a signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  during WK (Suppl.  Table S4). Further-  
more, across the three stages of interest  there were signiﬁcant  positive  
correlations  between  Image Residue  and word count, with eyes open as 
well as closed (Suppl.  Table S4). Thus, the more the participant  talked 
about both image and imagery,  the greater was the similarity  between  
their imagetic  contents.  In contrast,  there were no signiﬁcant  correla-  
tions between  word count and Aﬀect Residue  (Suppl.  Table S4). 
Next, we sought to describe  the dynamics  of aﬀective  valences  be- 
tween Image and Imagery,  and the relationship  between  their residues.  
We found a positive  correlation  between  the aﬀective  valences  of Image 
and Imagery  in WK and N1 trials, with the strongest  eﬀect in WK tri- 
als (Spearman  correlation,  WK Rho = 0.39, p < 0.0001;  N1 Rho = 0.25, 
p = 0.0003;  N2 Rho = 0.17, p = 0.0635;  Fig. 3 a). In addition  to the rescal- 
ing (rank preservation  as indicated  by positive  Spearman  correlations)  
of the aﬀective  valences,  we observed  a neutralization  of the aﬀective  
valences  for Imagery,  in comparison  with Image (Fig. 3b; Kolmogorov-  
Smirnov  test for aﬀective  valence  distributions  for WK p < 0.0001,  N1 
p = 0.0005,  and N2 p < 0.0001,  with Bonferroni  correction  for 3 com- 
parisons,  𝛼= 0.016).  
For the three states considered,  the variance  of the aﬀect scores de- 
creased  from the image report (eyes open) to the imagery  report (eyes 
closed),  reﬂecting  aﬀect neutralization  (mean ± variance:  from 5.13 ± 
2.49 to 5.57 ± 1.82 in WK; 5.11 ± 2.45 to 5.42 ± 1.62 in N1; 5.41 ± 
2.65 to 5.18 ± 1.44 in N2). To further characterize  this neutralization,  
we counted  the amount  of neutral  aﬀective  valence  grades and com- 
pared the frequency  after the visualization  of image (eyes open) or im- 
agery (eyes closed).  As shown in Fig. 3 c, there was signiﬁcant  aﬀective  
neutralization  for imagery  obtained  within WK, N1 and N2. In addition,  
the entropies  of the distributions  dropped  substantially  from Image to 
Imagery,  with the strongest  eﬀect within N2 ( Fig. 3 d). There was no 
signiﬁcant  correlation  between  Image and Aﬀect Residue,  nor between  
Image Residue  and the aﬀective  valences  of Image or Imagery,  neither  
when considering  all trials, nor when considering  speciﬁc  stages (Rho 
values ranging  from -0.12 to 0.7, p > 0.05). 
Power spectrum  density versus Image or Aﬀect Residue  
In contrast  with aﬀective  valences,  the visual contents  were far from 
neutralized  in Imagery,  which produced  a semantically  rich set of re- 
ports and a wide dynamic  range of Image Residues  ( Fig. 1 c, correlation  
matrix).  To gain insight into the neural correlates  of the Image Residue  
at sleep onset, we investigated  how Image Residue  related to EEG oscil- 
lations and power spectrum  density  within the 20s interval  before each 
beep that terminated  the WK, N1 and N2 trials. 
First, we assessed  the correlations  of Image Residue  with the abun- 
dance of vertex sharp-waves,  cortical  spindles,  or K complexes.  Contrary  
to our expectations  for cortical  spindles,  no signiﬁcant  correlations  were 
detected  ( Table 1 ). Similar  results were observed  for Aﬀect Residues  
( Table 1 ). 
Next, we assessed  the correlations  of Image and Aﬀect Residues  with 
EEG power within speciﬁc  frequency  bands. Well-established  EEG spec- 
tral markers  of the target stages were observed,  such as the robust occip- 
ital alpha (8.5-10.5  Hz) power during WK, the surge of theta power (4.5- 
8.5 Hz) during N1, and the drop in EEG power for frequencies  > 8.5 Hz 
during N2 (Suppl.  Fig. S1). During WK there were signiﬁcant  negative  
correlations  between  Image Residue  and power in both the theta (4.5 to

• Food vs Non Food (FNF) : Photos of food and non-food  items were 
shown to 30 subjects  to test craving  for food items. Each run had 16 
blocks with a 30-second  block length and TR of 1.6 s ( Smeets et al., 
2013 ). 
2  V. Tripathi and R. Garg NeuroImage  251 (2022) 118940 
• Aﬀective  Videos  (AV) : Eleven subjects  were shown audiovisual  
stimuli of various  emotional  valences.  Each block had 5 s of the stim- 
ulus with 7 s of ﬁxation.  TR was 2.2 s ( Kim et al., 2016 ). 
• Bilingual  words (BW) : Cross-Language  repetition  priming  was 
tested on 13 bilingual  subjects  ( Poldrack  et al., 2013 ) who were 
shown words of various  levels of diﬃculty  in Spanish  and English,  
and they had to rate whether  they know it or not. It was a trial based 
task with 1.5 s of stimulus  with around 1–6 s of ﬁxation  and TR of 
2 s. 
• Human  Connectome  Project  (HCP) : 169 subjects  with four tasks 
from the HCP Young Adult dataset ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ) are used: 
Social, Emotion,  Gambling  and Relational.  These subjects  had both 
7T and 3T acquisition  and scanned  for all seven tasks along with 
resting-state  and movie watching  dataset.  The four tasks are block- 
based with 15–25 s duration  per block and meant to activate  various  
task speciﬁc  regions.  In the Social task, subjects  viewed  20 s videos 
where objects (circles,  squares  and triangles)  interacted  with each 
other (social condition)  or moved around randomly  (random  con- 
dition) and subjects  had to detect whether  the objects had a social 
interaction,  no interaction  or not sure. In the Emotion  tasks, sub- 
jects were either presented  with faces (angry or fearful expression)  
or shapes and they had to decide which of the two faces or shapes at 
the bottom  of the screen matches  the face or shape at the top of the 
screen. The Gambling  task involved  subjects  playing  a card guessing  
game and subjects  had to guess if the mystery  card is greater or less 
than 5. In the Relational  task, subjects  viewed  two pairs of stimuli 
on top and bottom  of the screen which diﬀered  either by shape or 
texture.  Subjects  had to analyse  if the top pair diﬀer along one di- 
mension  and then respond  if the bottom  pair diﬀer along the same 
dimension  or not. In the control condition,  subjects  would see a pair 
of stimuli on the top and one stimuli on the bottom  of the screen 
and were given a cue of dimension  (shape or texture)  to attend and 
respond  if the bottom  object matched  with either of the top objects 
in the given dimension.  Kindly refer to ( Barch et al., 2013 ) for more 
details on the tasks and analysis.

2.2. Dataset 
We used the openly available  Multi-Domain  Task Battery  fMRI 
dataset ( King et al., 2019 ), designed  to measure  a broad range of cogni- 
tive processes.  All experimental  protocols  were approved  in the orig- 
inal study by the Ethics committee  at Western  University  (Protocol  
#107,293),  including  informed  consent  provided  to all participants.  In 
brief, 24 healthy  subjects  (16 F; age: M = 23.8, SD = 2.6) each engaged  in 
47 diverse  task conditions  (e.g., ﬁnger tapping,  movie watching,  n-back,  
rest) across 32 ∼10-minute  scans. Each scan consisted  of a continuous  
task paradigm,  in which subjects  performed  a sequence  of 17 tasks (5 ‑sec 
instructions,  30 ‑sec task execution)  presented  in a random  order ﬁxed 
across subjects  (see Fig. 1 for tasks and their annotations).  Subjects  were 
scanned  on two task sets (A and B), and each task set had two scanning  
sessions  (with 8 scans per session).  16 subjects  were scanned  on set A 
in year 1 and set B in year 2, while the other 8 subjects  were scanned  
on set A in year 2 and set B 2–3 weeks later. The two task sets partially  
overlapped:  29 task conditions  in A and 32 task conditions  in B, with 14 
common  to both. While the original  paper considered  target and non- 
target trials of the Verbal 2-back and Object 2-back tasks as diﬀerent  
conditions  (resulting  in 4 total conditions),  the current  study viewed  
working  memory  load as constant  across the trial types and thus consid-  
ered each version  of the n-back task as a single condition  (resulting  in 
2 total conditions).  Moreover,  since contrasts  in the present  study were 
computed  relative  to the Rest condition,  all analyses  described  herein 
are based on 44 unique task conditions.  Finally,  one subject ( sub-29)  
was excluded  from analyses  due to failure of fMRI preprocessing.

Ironsmith  is a fully automated  QSM processing  pipeline  for creating  
QSM maps and extracting  QSM-based  iron concentrations  from anatom-  
ical ROIs, including  both subcortical  and cortical  brain regions  (89 GM 
ROIs included  with version  1.2; See Appendix  A ). Ironsmith  is open 
source, under the GNU general  public license (version  3), and was de- 
veloped  entirely  using Bash script . The latest version  of Ironsmith  can 
2  V. Zachariou,  C.E. Bauer, D.K. Powell et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118835 
be downloaded  from Github , together  with full documentation  and in- 
stallation  instructions.  Ironsmith  can perform  the following  tasks: 
1 Automate  the process  of creating  QSM maps from GRE DICOM  im- 
ages using MEDI Toolbox  ( De Rochefort  et al., 2010 ; J. Liu et al., 
2012 ; Liu et al., 2011a , 2011b ). 
2 Register  MPR or multi-echo  MPR (MEMPR)  T1 images to QSM maps 
and then segment  these into 89 ROIs ( Appendix  A ), using Freesurfer  
( Dale et al., 1999 ; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). 
3 Extract QSM-based  iron concentrations  from 89 ROIs, ﬁlter outlier 
voxels from ROIs (default:  larger than the 97th percentile  of QSM 
values),  and output the results into comma  separated  variable  (CSV) 
tables. 
4 Calculate  SNR (GRE magnitude  image based) for each ROI as a mea- 
sure of quality control for QSM data and output SNR values in CSV 
tables. 
5 Identify  outlier regions  on phase images using a median  absolute  
deviation  (MAD) based outlier detection  process.  Calculate  the per- 
cent overlap  between  phase-image  outlier regions  and each of the 
89 supported  ROIs. Output the results into CSV tables. 
6 Non-linearly  warp QSM maps and aligned  MPR/MEMPR  to MNI152  
1mm space. This step allows users to (1) extract QSM values from 
standard  space ROIs not included  with Ironsmith  and (2) conduct  
voxelwise  analyses  (these options  are not used/described  in the 
present  manuscript,  which focuses  on extraction  of QSM values from 
native participant  space).

To accomplish  the motion artifact  correction  task, we have collected  
a set of clinical  brain MRI data at Seoul National  University  Hospi- 
tal (SNUH).  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all partici-  
pants and the study was approved  by the Institutional  Review  Board 
of SNUH. Our dataset contains  83 motion-free  clinical  subjects,  which 
was utilized  to generate  the simulated  motion data to conduct  network  
training.  Additionally,  separate  24 clinical  subjects  with motion dis- 
torted were acquired  to perform  the in-vivo assessment.  These real clin- 
ical subjects  were not instructed  to induce motion during data acquisi-  
tion. 3D T1-weighted  gradient  echoes,  called BRAin VOlume  (BRAVO),  
were acquired  on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner  (SIGNA  Premier,  GE Health-  
care, United States) with the following  imaging  parameters:  echo time

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118965,"2.1. Experiment  1 –registration  accuracy  of the multi-modal  brain 
targeting  system 
The registration  accuracy  of the multi-modal  brain targeting  system 
was evaluated  using CT and MRI. In each animal,  the two scans were 
performed  on the same day on a total of ten marmosets  (male N = 7, 
female N = 3, age 4.0 ± 2.2 years, weight 354 ± 33 g) over a period 
of ∼2 hours, during which the custom-made  plastic head holder with 
the multi-modal  marker  was attached  to the head. The animals  were 
pretreated  with an intramuscular  injection  of ketamine  (30 mg/kg)  and 
dexmedetomidine  (5.0 𝜇g/kg) plus atropine  sulphate  (50 μg/kg).  Af- 
ter sedation  and respiration  were stabilised,  the anaesthesia  level was 
maintained  with inhaled  isoﬂurane  (0.5 %), and intravenous  infusion  
of dexmedetomidine  (5.0 𝜇g/kg/hr).  Physiology  was monitored  using a 
pulse oximeter  (7500FO,  Nonin, MN, USA); pulse (120 bpm/min)  and 
oxygen  saturation  (94 ∼98 %) were maintained  by adjusting  the ﬂow 
rate of anaesthetic  gas. Rectal temperature  was monitored  (Model 1030; 
SA Instruments,  Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA), and maintained  at around 
34°C using a custom-made  warm water circulation  system.  
The custom-made  plastic head holder with the multi-modal  marker  
consisted  of the marker  container  ( Fig. 1 a) and head holder ( Fig. 1 b), 
which were designed  using a 3D software  (Rhinoceros  3D v5.0, McNeel  
& Associates,  USA) and produced  using a 3D printer (Agillista,  Keyence,  
Osaka, Japan).  A compact  stereotactic  device that couples  to the head 
holder and scanner  gantry that we use was also produced  (Supplemen-

Fig. 1. Design and construction  of non-invasive  head holder equipped  with multi-modal  markers.  (a) A multi-modal  marker container  (outer diameter  3.2 
mm, inner diameter  2.0 mm). (b) A head holder with six markers  (yellow cylinders)  (left) was ﬁxed to the marmoset’s  head noninvasively  (right). 
tary Fig. S1). The cylindrical  container  had outer dimensions  of 3.2 mm 
diameter  and 3.55 mm length, inner dimensions  of 2.0 mm diameter  
and 2.0 mm length, and the cap dimensions  were 3.2 mm diameter  
and 0.45 mm length. The container  was ﬁlled with Tungsten  solution  
(lithium  heteropolytungstate  [LST]) ( Ose et al., 2019 ) with density  (1.9 
g/mL) adjusted  to be close to the density  of cortical  bone ( White et al., 
1989 ). To prevent  evaporation  of the liquid, the container  was sealed 
with a cap using a UV-curable  resin (Bondic®,  Laser Bonding  Tech, Inc., 
Aurora,  ON, Canada).  However,  due to the small size of the marker  con- 
tainer and the high viscosity  of the marker  solution,  it was challenging  to 
avoid inclusion  of air bubbles  that reduced  the accuracy  with which the 
marker  centroid  could be determined.  Since MBFR requires  a minimum  
of three non-coplanar  markers,  we included  at least six marker  contain-  
ers to ensure a suﬃcient  number  of good markers.  The shape of the head 
holder ( Fig. 1 b) was based on the MR image of a marmoset  (male, age 
5.1 years, weight 407 g) that represented  one of the largest head sizes 
in our marmoset  population  (N = 10). To eﬃciently  place the markers  
around the brain, marker  containers  were placed so that any combi- 
nation of three markers  was not coplanar  ( Fig. 1 b, yellow cylinders).  
The head holder was ﬁxed on the animal’s  cranium  using 8 to 12 resin 
screws (RENY Pan head machine  screw M2.6, SUNCO  Industries  co.,ltd, 
Japan) (length:  2-8 mm) tightened  to the skin/cranial  bone. Before this 
procedure,  the screw points in the skin were locally anaesthetised  (lido- 
caine, 2%, 0.05 ml). This procedure  was relatively  noninvasive  and the 
skin and bone were not noticeably  damaged  after removal  of the head 
holder. 
After the head-holder  was attached,  the subject was transported  to 
the MRI scanner  (3-Tesla,  MAGNETOME  Prisma,  Siemens  AG, Erlan- 
gen, Germany)  equipped  with a custom-made  16-ch marmoset  head coil 
( Hori et al., 2018 ). T1-weighted  (T1w, MPRAGE  sequence,  TR = 2200 
ms, TE = 2.58 ms, TI = 700 ms, ﬂip angle = 8°, averages  = 3, scan 
time = 17.8 min, isotropic  voxel size = 0.36 mm, FOV = 70 ×59 ×46 
mm) and T2-weighted  (T2w, SPACE sequence,  TR = 3000 ms, TE = 558 
ms, turbo factor = 160, averages  = 1, scan time = 6.2 min, isotropic  
voxel size = 0.36 mm, FOV = 70 ×59 ×46 mm) images were acquired.  
Next, the animals  were transferred  from the MRI to the CT. CT was 
performed  on an animal micro CT scanner  (R_mCT2,  RIGAKU,  Japan).  
The scan parameters  were: X-ray voltage  of 90 kVp, tube current  of 0.2 
mA, FOV = diameter  73 mm ×height 57 mm, and acquisition  time 2.0 
min. The CT data was reconstructed  (isotropic  voxel size = 0.12 mm, 
matrix = 512 ×512 ×512) with the Feldkamp  cone-beam  algorithm  
( Feldkamp  et al., 1984 ). The CT scanner  was calibrated  to Hounsﬁeld  
units so that the output images have a value of -1000 for air and 0 for water. This calibration  allows us to obtain CT values of -30 to -70 for fat, 
20 to 100 for soft tissue, and > 1000 for bone ( Lev and Gonzalez,  2002 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(18792, 18797), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5273, 5279), match='\n2.2. '>"

We begin by using a primary  dataset,  the Healthy  Brain Network  
(HBN), to explore  diﬀerences  between  left- and right-handed  individu-  
als within networks  of interest  using functional  connectivity  to acknowl-  
edge previous  literature  and show these results in the context  of func- 
tional connectivity.  We then show that diﬀerences  between  left- and 
right-handed  individuals  within our primary  dataset generalizes  to other 
datasets,  such as the Philadelphia  Neurodevelopmental  Cohort (PNC). 
After combining  these datasets  to maximize  statistical  power, we subse- 
quently  explore  diﬀerences  in handedness  using functional  connectivity  
across the whole brain. Our secondary  analyses  on the cerebellum  are 
subsequently  derived  from interesting  patterns  and results that emerge  
from the whole brain analyses.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(7280, 7285), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(876, 882), match='\n2.2. '>"

We examined  a sample of 120 healthy  subjects  aged 27.5 ± 5.2 years 
with a mean education  of 12.4 ± 0.9 years (76 females,  44 males).  Sub- 
jects participated  in the study as 60 randomly  assigned  same-sex  pairs 
(mean within-pair  age diﬀerence  5.4 ± 4.5 years, education  diﬀerence  
1.1 ± 1.5 years). Prior to participation,  subjects  were screened  to ensure 
they had no history of neurological  or mental illness, pregnancy,  and 
conformed  to MRI exclusion  criteria.  The study protocol  was approved  
by the Ethics Committee  of the University  of Heidelberg,  for which sub- 
jects provided  written  informed  consent.  Data from 18 dyads had been

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119037,"2.1. Data and preprocessing  
We use MRI data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP). The 
MRI acquisition  protocols  have been extensively  described  and pre- 
sented elsewhere  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). In particular,  we used 50 subjects  
(see Supplementary  Appendix  A.6 for IDs) consisting  of 4 sessions  of RS 
scans (1200 volumes  each, a total of 4800 frames),  and 2 sessions  each 
of task fMRI data (i.e., working  memory,  relational  memory,  social, lan- 
guage, emotion,  and motor tasks). Functional  volumes  underwent  the 
standard  pre-processing  steps ( Van Dijk et al., 2010 ). All functional  im- 
ages were ﬁrst realigned  to the mean functional  volume  for each partici-  
pant. The realigned  volumes  were registered  to the structural  T1 data us- 
ing rigid-body  registration  (SPM12,  https://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk  ), and 
were detrended  (i.e., constant,  linear, quadratic)  to remove  signal drifts. 
Then, the images were smoothed  using a Gaussian  kernel with FWHM 
equal to 6mm. Finally,  we used the Automated  Anatomical  Labeling  
(AAL, 90 regions)  atlas that was re-sliced  to native fMRI space to par- 
cellate fMRI volumes  and compute  regionally  averaged  fMRI BOLD sig- 
nals. The structural  and diﬀusion-weighted  MRI data of each subject 
were downloaded  from the HCP and were processed  using MRtrix3  
( http://www.mrtrix.org/  ). We used single shell (b = 3000) multi-tissue  
to estimate  the response  function,  while ﬁber orientation  distribution  
functions  were computed  using constrained  spherical  deconvolution  of 
order 8. Tractogram  generation  was performed  using deterministic  trac- 
tography  with about 2 ×10 7 output streamlines  and was seeded from the 
white matter.  Fiber density  was used as metric to deﬁne the individual  
SCs and were computed  by dividing  the total number  of ﬁbers that con- 
nect each of the pairwise  regions  of the AAL atlas with both the mean 
ﬁber length and the average  of the sizes of the two regions  considered.  
The normalization  with respect to the region sizes is done to ensure 
that the strength  of the connection  is not biased towards  the size of the 
ROIs. The ﬁnal SC matrix was obtained  by averaging  all SC matrices  of 
all subjects.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11512, 11517), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2284, 2290), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118902,"2.1. Participants  and MR acquisition  protocol  
Eight participants  (six female)  took part in the day2day  study 
( Filevich  et al., 2017 ) and were scanned  with an imaging  protocol  in- 
cluding  MRS over a period of four months.  Insuﬃcient  MRS data (N < 
3) was acquired  for two participants  and these were excluded  from fur- 
ther analysis,  leaving  six participants  (ﬁve female)  who were scanned  
an average  of 11 times over the study period. 
MRI and MRS were collected  on a 3T Magnetom  Trio MRI scan- 
ner system (Siemens  Medical  Systems,  Erlangen,  Germany)  using a 12- 
channel  radiofrequency  head coil. The fMRI stability  quality assurance  
procedure  ( Friedman  and Glover,  2006 ) was performed  weekly,  to en- 
sure consistency  of the MR measurements,  and no major hardware  or 
software  changes  were made over the study period. 
A T1 weighted  anatomical  MRI scan (MPRAGE)  was acquired  at 
each session with the following  sequence  parameters:  TR = 2500 ms, 
TE = 4.77 ms, TI = 1100 ms, FOV = 256 ×256 ×192 mm 3 , ﬂip an- 
gle = 7°, bandwidth  = 140 Hz/pixel,  1 ×1 ×1 mm 3 voxel size, 9:20 min 
duration.  A single voxel MRS PRESS acquisition  volume  (25 ×30 ×20 
mm 3 ) was placed on the bilateral  ACC ( Figure 1 A) and both water sup- 
pressed  (128 averages)  and water reference  (8 averages)  were acquired  
from the same region. The following  MRS sequence  parameters  were 
used: TR = 3000 ms, TE = 80 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, 2048 complex  data 
points, 2500Hz  spectral  width, “advanced  ”automated  shimming,  6:36 
min duration.  Water suppression  was performed  with the vendor im- 
plementation  of CHESS ( Haase et al., 1985 ). An intermediate  echo-time  of 80 ms was chosen based on its particular  eﬃcacy  for the detection  
of glutamate  at 3 Tesla ( Schubert  et al., 2004 ) and the general  reduc- 
tion of spectral  interference  from macromolecules  and residual  water 
associated  with longer echo-times.  
Further  details on participants  and the MR acquisition  protocol  is 
available  in the day2day  investigation  paper ( Filevich  et al., 2017 ). The 
day2day  study was approved  by The Ethics Committee  of CharitéUni-  
versity Clinic, Berlin.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(8279, 8284), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2234, 2240), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118870,"3.1. Curvature  overshoot  bias 
Possibly  the earliest  bias established  for dMRI tractography  was 
the fact that if the streamline  algorithm  simply takes a step of ﬁnite 
size in the direction  of the local ﬁber orientation  at the current  vertex 
(a so-called  “ﬁrst-order  ”m e t h o d ) ,  streamlines  in curved bundles  will 
tend to under-estimate  the curvature,  resulting  in erroneous  trajectories  
( Tournier  et al., 2002 ). While use of a step size that is small relative  to 
the image voxel size mitigates  the issue, use of a higher-order  integra-  
tion method  during tracking  that directly  accounts  for such curvature  
is a more direct solution  ( Basser et al., 2000 ). However,  doing so in a 
manner  that is compatible  with diﬀusion  models that account  for cross- 
ing ﬁbers can be technically  diﬃcult  ( Aydogan  and Shi, 2020; Cheriﬁ

3.6. Benchmarks  
To have a comprehensive  understanding  of the challenges  in the 
EEG-based  biometrics  competition,  we divided  the benchmark  test into 
three levels. 
(1) Oﬄine  evaluation  aims to reveal the challenge  of the compe-  
tition with the increasing  population  size and cross-session,  and 
cross-task;  
(2) Mock online test aims to evaluate  the performances  of diﬀerent  
baseline  models without  information  leakage.  
(3) Online  submission  provides  an example  code and the baseline  
score in the public. 
3.6.1. Oﬄine evaluation  
For oﬄine evaluation,  three analyses  were performed  to show the 
challenge  of the increasing  population  sizes, cross-session,  and cross- 
task tests in this EEG-based  biometrics  competition.  These analyses  were

performed  on the data from 20 subjects  in the calibration  set and enroll- 
ment set, whose subject ID of the second session was known.  To avoid 
any possible  information  leakage,  all the analyses  were limited to these 
20 subjects,  not any data and label information  from the testing set has 
been used. The intruder  was not considered.  The train/test  pipeline  and 
performance  metric for these analyses  were detailed  as follows:  (1) Testing  on increasing  population  sizes: To evaluate  the inﬂu- 
ence of increasing  population  sizes on the performance  of EEG- 
based biometrics,  we performed  a within-task  and cross-session  
testing the number  of subjects  was increased  from 2 to 20 with 
the step of 2 subjects.  To avoid training  bias, subjects  were ran- 
domly selected  10 times for each number  of subjects.  The epochs

11 intruders).  
from diﬀerent  EEG tasks were used for the testing separately.  For 
each task, the data from the ﬁrst session was used to train, and 
the data from the second session was used to test. 
(2) Testing  across tasks: To compare  the performance  between  
within and cross tasks, we performed  cross-session  testing with 
a population  size of 20. EEG data of a particular  task from one 
session (session  1/session  2) was used to train the model, and 
EEG data of another  task from the other session (session  2/ses- 
sion 1) was used to test. And then the training  set and the testing 
set would be exchanged  Since AEP, SEP and VEP are in the same 
runs, we treated them as one condition/task,  EP (i.e., Evoked  Po- 
tential).  Also, the term ME (Motor execution)  was used to repre- 
sent the LH, RH, and RF conditions.  
(3) Testing  across sessions:  To compare  the performance  between  
within and cross sessions,  we performed  the within-task  test with 
a population  size of 20. To make a fair comparison  of the perfor- 
mance between  within-session  and cross-session  tests, the train- 
ing set was the ﬁrst half of the epochs in the ﬁrst session,  which 
was the same for the within-session  tests and cross-session  tests. 
For the within-session  test, the testing set was the second half 
of the epochs in the ﬁrst session.  For the cross-session  tests, the 
testing set was all epochs from the second session.  
In the oﬄine evaluation,  𝐴𝑐 𝑐 was adopted  as the performance  met- 
ric of the identiﬁcation  task, which is the larger the better, and 𝐸 𝐸 𝑅 
was used for the veriﬁcation  task, which is the smaller  the better 
( Maiorana,  2021b ; Bidgoly  et al., 2022 ; Kang et al., 2018 ). 
3.6.2. Mock online test 
To evaluate  the performances  of diﬀerent  models without  any infor- 
mation leakage  from the testing set, mock online test was performed  on 
the 20 subjects  in the true calibration  set and enrollment  set. Similar  to 
the dataset composition  of the online competition,  we divided  these 20 
subjects  into the mock enrollment  set, calibration  set, and testing set. 
• The mock enrollment  training  set consisted  of epochs from the ﬁrst 
sessions  of the ﬁrst 18 subjects  (Sub001  - Sub018).  
• The mock calibration  set consisted  of epochs from the ﬁrst sessions  
of the ﬁrst 10 subjects  (Sub001  - Sub010).  
• The mock testing set consisted  of epochs from the second session of 
another  10 subjects  (Sub011-  Sub020),  in which Sub019  and Sub020  
were set as intruders.  The epochs from the ﬁrst session of Sub019  and 
Sub020  were not used. For mock online test, the performance  metrics,  Accuracy  ( 𝐴𝑐 𝑐 ),

More speciﬁcally,  𝑇 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 represents  the training  time of the classiﬁer  by 
the epochs from Sub11-Sub18  in the ﬁrst session.  𝑇 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 represents  the 
testing for all epochs of Sub11-Sub20  in the second session.  Finally,  the 
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 is the overall accuracy  considering  both tasks, which decides  the 
ranking  of diﬀerent  baseline  models in the mock online test, the larger 
the better.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119600,"2.1. Streamline  reduction  and simpliﬁcation  
Streamline  reduction  is performed  based on hierarchical  clustering,  
following  the approach  implemented  by Schiavi  et al. (2020) . We ﬁrst 
divide the streamlines  with respect to anatomical  information,  in par- 
ticular based on the regions  they connect  given a cortical  and sub- 
cortical  brain parcellation  ( Fig. 2 A). Secondly,  each group of stream-  
lines is clustered  based on geometrical  criterion,  in our case represented  
by their average  euclidean  distance.  To this aim, we exploit QuickBun-  
dle ( Garyfallidis  et al., 2012 ) ( Fig. 2 B) to reduce the number  of stream-  
lines needed  to represent  connections  between  regions.  The clustering  
threshold  can be manually  chosen by the user and for our tests, we set it 
to 3 mm. Thanks  to this procedure  we can simplify  the bundle represen-  
tation and reduce the tractogram  complexity.  In particular,  by removing  
unwanted  redundancy  we are able to downsize  the input tractogram  us- 
ing, on average,  only the 2% of the initial set of streamlines.  
The resulting  streamlines  are then simpliﬁed  to minimize  the num- 
ber of parameters  needed  to represent  each trajectory,  as in the work 
of Lemkaddem  et al. (2014) , using the Douglas-Peucker  reduction  algo- 
rithm ( Douglas  and Peucker,  1973 ), which selects the minimal  subset 
of coordinates  given an approximation  threshold  ( Fig. 2 C). We reduce 
the number  of coordinates  to represent  each streamline  using between  
4 and 6 control points, in line with previous  works ( Jbabdi et al., 2007; 
Lemkaddem  et al., 2014 ). The set of points is then interpolated  using 
a particular  class of cubic B-splines,  named Catmull-Rom  ( Catmull  and 
Rom, 1974 )( Fig. 2 D), characterized  by several desirable  properties.  First 
of all, they preserve  the starting  and ending points, i.e. the ﬁrst and last 
points remain the original  ones, meaning  that the original  connectivity  is 
preserved  giving the fact that the reduced  streamlines  connect  the same 
regions.  Secondly,  the interpolated  trajectories  intersect  all the control 
points, which permits  a better supervision  of their spatial position  and 
to avoid the reconstruction  of pathways  outside  white matter regions.

Fig. 2 A is an example  showing  a set of projection  ﬁbers segmented  based on Freesurfer  atlas. Each connection  is than clustered  ( Fig. 2 B) keeping only the representative  
streamlines  for each cluster. These are simpliﬁed  using Ramer-Douglas-Peucker  algorithm  ( Fig. 2 C) which reduces the number of points needed to approximate  the 
streamline  trajectories.  Finally these coordinates  are interpolated  using cubic b-splines  ( Fig. 2 D).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10203, 10208), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3043, 3049), match='\n2.2. '>"

For a discrete  axon radii distribution  of 𝐵individual  radii with 𝑛 ( 𝑘 )

The MRI-visible,  eﬀective  mean radius ( 𝑟 eﬀ) ( Burcaw  et al., 2015; 
Sepehrband  et al., 2016; Veraart  et al., 2020 ) can be estimated  from the 
intra-axonal  signal of dMRI. Clinical  acquisition  employs  pulse-gradient  
spin echo dMRI sequences  with wide pulses, i.e. using pulse widths

wards the tail of the axon radii distribution  because  𝑤 eﬀ, ( 𝑘 ) scales with 
the ﬁfth power of 𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) . Each radius 𝑟 ( 𝑘 ) denotes  the radius of a circular

systems  ( Aghourian  et al., 2017; Bedard et al., 2019; Beliveau  et al., 
2017; Ding et al., 2010; DuBois et al., 2016; Dukart et al., 2018; Galle- 
zot et al., 2010; Hillmer  et al., 2016; Kaller et al., 2017; Kantonen  et al.,

2015; Parker et al., 2015; Sandiego  et al., 2015; Savli et al., 2012; 
Smart et al., 2019 ). To protect patient conﬁdentiality,  individual  par- 
ticipant  maps were averaged  within studies before being shared.  Each 
study, the associated  receptor/transporter,  tracer, number  of healthy  
participants,  age, and reference  with full methodological  details can be 
found in Table S1. In all cases, only scans from healthy  participants  
were included.  Images were acquired  using best practice  imaging  pro- 
tocols recommended  for each radioligand.  Altogether,  the images are 
an estimate  of receptor  densities  and we therefore  refer to the mea- 
sured value (i.e. binding  potential,  tracer distribution  volume)  simply 
as density.  PET images were all registered  to the MNI-ICBM  152 non- 
linear 2009 (version  c, asymmetric)  template,  then parcellated  to a par- 
cellation  with 68 and 219 cortical  regions,  as well as 15 subcortical  
regions,  according  to the Lausanne  atlas ( Cammoun  et al., 2012; De- 
sikan et al., 2006 ). Receptors  and transporters  with more than one mean 
image of the same tracer (i.e. 5-HT 1 B , D 2 , mGluR 5 , and VAChT)  were 
averaged  together  in a manner  that weights  each image by the num- 
ber of participants  in the cohort. Tracer images are highly consistent  
across cohorts  (see Fig. S1 in Hansen  et al. (2021) ). In some cases, im- 
ages of multiple  tracers for the same receptor  were available.  In these 
cases, we show the tracer with the larger number  of participants  in the 
main text, but we ﬁnd consistent  results when analyses  are repeated  
for alternative  tracers (Fig. S9). Finally,  each tracer map correspond-  
ing to each receptor/transporter  was z-scored  across regions  and con- 
catenated  into a ﬁnal region ×receptor  matrix of relative  densities.  This 
data was presented  and used originally  in Hansen  et al. (2021) and is 
available  in neuromaps  ( https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ) 
( Markello  et al., 2022 ). 
Autoradiography  data acquisition  
In vitro receptor  autoradiography  data were originally  collected  and 
processed  as described  in Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) . Fif- 
teen neurotransmitter  receptor  densities  across 44 cytoarchitectonically  
identiﬁed  areas in three post-mortem  brains were acquired  from Supple-  
mentary  Table 2 of Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) (see Table S2 
for a complete  list of receptors  included  in the autoradiography  dataset).  
Detailed  information  concerning  the standard  incubation  protocols  es- 
tablished  over the last 25 years at Julich Research  Centre and neces- 
sary for labeling  the receptors  is provided  in Supplementary  Table of 
Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher  (2017) (see also Palomero-Gallagher  and 
Zilles (2018) ; Zilles et al. (2002a,b)  ). Note that GABA A and GABA A∕BZ 
refer to the same receptor,  but that GABA A∕BZ refers speciﬁcally  to 
GABA A receptors  containing  the allosteric  benzodiazepine  binding  site, 
as opposed  to receptors  containing  only the GABA neurotransmitter  
binding  site. To best compare  PET data analyses  with the autoradiogra-  
phy dataset,  a region-to-region  mapping  was manually  created  between  
the 44 available  cortical  regions  in the autoradiography  dataset and the 
34 left hemisphere  cortical  Desikan  Killiany  regions.  In only one case 
(the insula) was there no suitable  mapping  between  the autoradiogra-  
phy data and the Desikan  Killiany  atlas. As such, the 44-region  autora-  
diography  atlas was converted  to 33 Desikan  Killiany  left hemisphere  
regions.  Finally,  receptor  densities  were z-scored  and averaged  across 
laminar  layers, to create a single map of receptor  densities  across the 
cortex (for results across three laminar  layers, see Fig. S2). 
Microarray  gene expression  
Regional  microarray  expression  data were obtained  from six post- 
mortem  brains provided  by the Allen Human  Brain Atlas (AHBA;  
http://human.brain-map.org/  ) ( Hawrylycz  et al., 2012 ). Since only two of the six brains included  samples  from the right hemisphere,  main anal- 
yses were conducted  on the left hemisphere  only. All processing  was 
performed  using the abagen toolbox  ( https://github.com/netneurolab/  
abagen  ( Markello  et al., 2021 )). These data were processed  and mapped  
to parcellated  brain regions  at 34 and 111 left hemisphere  cortical  grey 
matter nodes according  to the Lausanne  anatomical  atlas ( Cammoun  
et al., 2012; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). For completeness,  data were also par- 
cellated  to 15 bilateral  subcortical  regions.  Due to the coarse subcortical  
parcellation,  suﬃcient  probes were available  for both hemispheres.  
Microarray  probes were reannotated  using data provided  by 
Arnatkevi  či ū t ėet al. (2019) . A single microarray  probe with the high- 
est diﬀerential  stability,  Δ𝑆 ( 𝑝 ) , was selected  to represent  each gene 
( Hawrylycz  et al., 2015 ), where diﬀerential  stability  was calculated  as: 
Δ𝑆 ( 𝑝 ) = 1 (𝑁 
2 )𝑁−1 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝑁 ∑
𝑗= 𝑖 +1 𝑟 [ 𝐵 𝑖 ( 𝑝 ) , 𝐵 𝑗 ( 𝑝 )] (1) 
Here, 𝑟 is Spearman’s  rank correlation  of the expression  of a single probe 
𝑝 across regions  in two donor brains, 𝐵 𝑖 and 𝐵 𝑗 , and 𝑁is the total 
number  of donor brains. Diﬀerential  stability  is the average  correlation  
across every pair of donor brains of a probe’s  expression.  This procedure  
retained  20 232 probes,  each representing  a unique gene. We repeat the 
analyses  using alternative  probe selection  methods  and ﬁnd consistent  
results (Fig. S10). 
Next, samples  were assigned  to brain regions  using MNI coor- 
dinates  generated  via non-linear  registrations  ( https://github.com/  
chrisﬁlo/alleninf ) by ﬁnding  the nearest  region, up to 2 mm away. 
To reduce the potential  for misassignment,  sample-to-region  match- 
ing was constrained  by hemisphere  and cortical/subcortical  divisions  
( Arnatkevi  či ū t ėe t al., 2019 ). If a brain region was not assigned  any 
sample based on the above procedure,  the sample closest to the cen- 
troid of that region was selected  in order to ensure that all brain regions  
were assigned  a value. 
Inter-subject  variation  was addressed  by normalizing  tissue sample 
expression  values for each donor across genes using a scaled robust sig- 
moid function  ( Fulcher  and Fornito,  2016 ): 
𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 1 
1 + exp (− ( 𝑥 𝑔 − ⟨𝑥 𝑔 ⟩) 
IQR 𝑥 ) (2) 
where ⟨𝑥 𝑔 ⟩is the median  and IQR is the normalized  interquartile  range 
of the expression  value of a single gene across regions.  Normalized  gene 
expression  values were then rescaled  to a unit interval:  
𝑥 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 = 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 − min ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) 
max ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) − min ( 𝑥 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) (3) 
Gene expression  values were normalized  across tissue samples  using the 
same procedure.  Samples  assigned  to the same brain region were then 
averaged  separately  for each donor. Scaled regional  expression  proﬁles  
were ﬁnally averaged  across donors.  
Finally,  we repeat all analyses  using RNAseq  data collected  from 
the two donors with RNAseq  measurements  (see Fig. S1 and Fig. S3) 
( Hawrylycz  et al., 2012 ). Gene expression-receptor  density  associations  
across neurotransmitter  receptors  in both the PET and autoradiography  
datasets  remain consistent  whether  gene expression  is derived  from the 
microarray  or RNAseq  (Fig. S11). 
Gene-receptor  pairs 
With the notable  exception  of the GABA B receptor,  metabotropic  
neurotransmitter  receptors  are monomeric  structures,  and thus a sin- 
gle gene codes for the entire receptor.  Therefore,  the expression  of the 
receptor-coding  gene was correlated  with the density  of the receptor  
itself. The GABA B and ionotropic  receptors  are characterized  by being 
multimeric  protein  complexes,  so each receptor  was correlated  with mi- 
croarray  expression  of all possible  receptor  subunits.  Below, we outline 
each multimeric  case. 
8  J.Y. Hansen, R.D. Markello,  L. Tuominen  et al. NeuroImage  264 (2022) 119671 
•GABA A is a pentamer  typically  composed  of three primary  subunits  
( 𝛼1 , 𝛽2 , and 𝛾2 ) but can be built out of a total of nineteen  diﬀerent  
subunits.  For simplicity,  we show results for the three primary  sub- 
units in the main text, but results for the remaining  sixteen subunits  
can be found in Fig. S12. 
•GABA B , a multimeric  metabotropic  receptor,  is composed  of two 
subunits.  We show both in the main analyses.  
•AMPA is a heterotetramer  that typically  consists  of two pairs of du- 
plicate subunits.  These two pairs can be formed  from any combina-  
tion of four subunits.  We show results for the gene whose expres-  
sion is most highly correlated  with AMPA density  in the main text 
( GRIA1 ). 
•NMDA is also a heterotetramer,  typically  composed  of two N1 and 
two N2 subunits,  although  there are four diﬀerent  N2 -encoding  
genes, as well as a third subunit  ( N3 ) for which there are two subunit-  
encoding  genes. The main analyses  use the expression  of the N1 - 
encoding  gene ( GRIN1 ). 
•Kainate  exists as both a homotetramer  and heterotetramer,  built 
from any of ﬁve subunits.  We show results for the gene whose ex- 
pression  is most highly correlated  with kainate  density  in the main 
text ( GRIK2 ). 
•𝛼4 𝛽2 is a pentamer  typically  composed  of two 𝛼4 subunits  and three 
𝛽2 subunits  ( Dani, 2015 ). However,  the ligand used for the autora-  
diograph,  epibatidin,  binds to any heteromeric  nicotinic  receptors  
that contain  both an alpha subunit  ( 𝛼2 –𝛼7 , 𝛼9 , 𝛼10 ) and a beta sub- 
unit ( 𝛽2 –𝛽4 ). The most abundant  such receptor  in the brain is the 𝛼4 𝛽2 
receptor,  so we focus on gene expression  of the 𝛼4 and 𝛽2 subunits  
( CHRNA4  and CHRNB2  , respectively)  in the main text. 
Correlations  between  neurotransmitter  receptor  density  and multiple  
subunit  expression  were corrected  for multiple  comparisons  using the 
Benjamini-Hochberg  FDR correction  ( Benjamini  and Hochberg,  1995 ). 
Correlation  coeﬃcients  and corrected  𝑝 -values (see Null model ) for all 
subunits  can be found in Table S3 (PET, cortex) Table S4 (PET, subcor-  
tex), and Table S5 (autoradiography)  as well as in stand-alone  machine-  
readable  supplementary  csv ﬁles. 
Null model 
Spatial autocorrelation-preserving  permutation  tests were used to as- 
sess statistical  signiﬁcance  of associations  across brain regions,  termed 
“spin tests ”( Alexander-Bloch  et al., 2018; Markello  and Misic, 2021 ). 
Parametric  𝑝 -values were not used because  spatially  embedded  systems  
such as the brain violate the assumption  that observations  (brain re- 
gions) are independent  from one another.  We created  a surface-based  
representation  of the parcellation  on the FreeSurfer  fsaverage  left hemi- 
sphere surface,  via ﬁles from the Connectome  Mapper  toolkit ( https: 
//github.com/LTS5/cmp  ). We used the spherical  projection  of the fsav- 
erage left hemisphere  surface to deﬁne spatial coordinates  for each par- 
cel by selecting  the coordinates  of the vertex closest to the center of 
the mass of each parcel ( Vázquez-Rodríguez  et al., 2019 ). These par- 
cel coordinates  were then randomly  rotated,  and original  parcels were 
reassigned  the value of the closest rotated  parcel (10 000 repetitions).  
Parcels for which the medial wall was closest were assigned  the value of 
the next most proximal  parcel instead.  The procedure  was performed  at 
the parcel resolution  rather than the vertex resolution  to avoid upsam-  
pling the data, and only to the left hemisphere.  In the autoradiography  
dataset,  null correlations  were computed  ignoring  the insula and regions  
resampled  to the insula, for a maximum  of three ignored  brain regions.  
All reported  𝑝 -values for expression-density  correlations  are one-tailed.  
Structural  connectivity  
Following  the procedure  described  in de Wael et al. (2018) , we 
obtained  diﬀusion  weighted  imaging  data for 326 unrelated  partic- 
ipants (age range 2235 years, 145 males) from the Human  Con- 
nectome  Project (HCP; S900 release ( Van Essen et al., 2013 )). DWI data was pre-processed  using the MRtrix3  package  ( Tournier  et al., 
2019 ) ( https://www.mrtrix.org/  ). More speciﬁcally,  ﬁber orientation  
distributions  were generated  using the multi-shell  multi-tissue  con- 
strained  spherical  deconvolution  algorithm  from MRtrix ( Dhollander  
et al., 2016; Jeurissen  et al., 2014 ). White matter edges were then re- 
constructed  using probabilistic  streamline  tractography  based on the 
generated  ﬁber orientation  distributions  ( Tournier  et al., 2010 ). The 
tract weights  were then optimized  by estimating  an appropriate  cross- 
section multiplier  for each streamline  following  the procedure  proposed  
by Smith et al. (2015) and a connectivity  matrix was built for each par- 
ticipant  using the 68-region  Deskian-Killiany  parcellation  ( Cammoun  
et al., 2012; Desikan  et al., 2006 ). Collating  each individual’s  structural  
connectome  was done using a group-consensus  approach  that seeks to 
preserve  the density  and edge-length  distributions  of the individual  con- 
nectomes  ( Betzel et al., 2019 ). The binary density  for the ﬁnal whole- 
brain structural  connectome  was 31 . 2% . Edges were weighted  by the 
average  log-transform  of non-zero  streamline  density,  scaled to values 
between  0 and 1. Detailed  information  regarding  data acquisition  and

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118987,"2.1. Advancing  multiscale  neuroanatomy  and structure-function  
exploration  
By oﬀering  a continuous  perspective  to assess subregional  hetero- 
geneity,  to arrange  cortical  areas along axes of whole-brain  organiza-  
tion, and to interrogate  structure-function  relationships,  gradient  map- 
ping may advance  cortical  cartography,  and thus inform and comple-  
ment established  perspectives  on cortical  arealization  ( Genon et al., 
2021 ; Eickhoﬀet  al., 2018a ). The Special Issue includes  several papers 
that provide  important  proof of principle  for the utility of continuous  
representations  in characterizing  cortical  areas and networks.  
On a whole-brain  scale, gradients  appear to map the global rela- 
tionships  between  distributed  functional  systems  as well as how spa- 
tial features  of speciﬁc  systems  map are situated  within broader  pat- 
terns of organization.  And while sensory  systems,  such as the visual and 
auditory  domains,  have long been the focus of research  into domain-  
speciﬁc  hierarchies  —o f t e n  described  as stepwise  processing  streams  —the methodologies  and frameworks  aﬀorded  by a gradient-based  per- 
spective  enable insight into other domains.  For example,  the somatosen-  
sory system demonstrates  three processing  hierarchies  extending  away 
from the central sulcus ( Saadon  Grosman  et al., 2020 ). The authors  com- 
bine tactile body stimulation  and fMRI measurements  to identify  func- 
tional gradients  in somatosensory  areas. By stratifying  response  patterns  
with respect to laterality  and selectivity,  they furthermore  show corre- 
spondence  between  gradients  and a functional  hierarchy  of somatosen-  
sory representations.  Lefco et al. (2020) examine  gradients  of fronto- 
parietal  network  organization,  combining  analysis  of visual attention  
and visual short-term  memory  fMRI tasks with resting-state  fMRI con- 
nectomics.  Their ﬁndings  reveal ﬁne-scale  gradients  in functional  con- 
nectivity  within the frontoparietal  visual network.  
Focussing  on the insula, a paralimbic  cortical  region, 
Royer et al. (2020) study microstructural  gradients  based on myelin-  
sensitive  MRI analysis.  They report dominant  axes of subregional  
microstructural  organization,  one running  in anterior-posterior  di- 
rection and one diﬀerentiating  the dorsal anterior  subdivision  from 
the remaining  insular cortex. In addition,  they show associations  
to underlying  histological  characteristics  and large-scale  functional  
network  connectivity,  suggesting  that microstructural  variations  can 
help to understand  functional  diversity  in integrative  hub regions  
such as the insula. Assessing  another  nexus in the human limbic 
system,  Kharabian  Masouleh  et al. (2020) study gradients  of structural  
covariance  in the hippocampus,  a structure  in the mesiotemporal  lobe. 
They demonstrate  a principal  gradient  running  along the hippocampal  
long axis that closely follows  its main axis of functional  diﬀerentia-  
tion, and a second gradient  that runs along dorsal ventral axes that 
reﬂects  hippocampal  microstructural  diﬀerentiation.  Also investigating  
the architecture  of paralimbic  areas, Waymel  et al. (2020) associate  
diﬀerent  functional  gradients  with meta-analytical  activations  from 
episodic  memory  and olfactory  tasks, and show that the ﬁrst, sensory-  
transmodal  functional  gradient  relates most strongly  to episodic  
memory  processing,  whereas  the ﬁfth functional  gradient  describes  
a piriform-isocortical  pattern  related most to olfaction.  The authors  
interpret  their ﬁndings  in the context  of the ‘dual origin’ theory 
( Sanides,  1962 ), which posits that cortical  evolution  emanated  along 
progressive  rings of laminar  diﬀerentiation  from origins in the piriform  
and parahippocampal  cortex. Taking a cortex-wide  perspective  on 
the interplay  between  microstructure,  connectivity,  and hierarchical  
organization,  Vezoli et al. (2021) review laminar-speciﬁc  projection  
patterns  and their association  to cortical  hierarchies.  Their ﬁndings  
provide  evidence  for a dual counter  stream architecture,  which incorpo-  
rates distance-dependent  feedback  and feedforward  pathways  through  
supra- and infragranular  layers, respectively.  
Despite  a focus of prior work on cortical  organization,  several stud- 
ies in the special issue also investigate  subcortical  structures  as well 
as white matter architecture,  which are thought  to be key aspects  to 
fully understand  whole brain organization  and dynamics  ( Shine et al., 
2019a , 2019b ). Yang et al. (2020) derived  thalamic  functional  gradients  
based on resting-state  fMRI, identifying  a ﬁrst medio-lateral  and a sec- 
ond anterior-posterior  gradient.  They furthermore  show that the ﬁrst 
gradient  reﬂects  known thalamic  subnuclear  divisions,  while the sec- 
ond gradient  was found to relate to established  associations  between  the 
thalamus  and cortical  intrinsic  functional  communities  as well as cog- 
nitive ontologies.  Also studying  thalamic  subregional  organization  and 
its link to cortex-wide  function,  Muller et al. (2020) show that diﬀerent  
neuronal  subpopulations  of the thalamus  diﬀerentially  relate to corti- 
cal gradients,  time scales, and dynamics.  They show that core neuronal  
populations  (expressing  parvalbumin)  innervate  more strongly  granular  
cortical  layers and project more closely to sensory/unimodal  regions,  
while matrix populations  (expressing  calbindin)  innervate  supragranular  
layers more diﬀusely  and correlate  more closely to higher/transmodal  
regions  with longer time scales. Cona et al. (2021) carry out a meta- 
analysis  of neuroimaging  studies that investigates  cortical  representa-  
tions for space and time. They identify  a set of distributed  regions,  in-

cluding  insular,  pre-SMA,  opercular  and intraparietal  regions,  and ob- 
serve a gradient  of activation  values related to time vs space process-  
ing. Assessing  interactions  between  cortical  functional  organization  and 
white matter architecture,  Friedrich  et al. (2020) map the principal  
sensory-transmodal  functional  gradient  to the midsection  of the cor- 
pus callosum,  a major pathway  connecting  both cortical  hemispheres.  
Transmodal  gradient  values are found to be represented  on the genu, 
the anterior  part of the callosum,  while sensory  and motor regions  are 
represented  more posteriorly,  suggesting  a potentially  mirrored  topog- 
raphy of cortical  function  and inter-hemispheric  structural  connectivity.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10405, 10410), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(6805, 6811), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119486,"2.1. T1-w MRI image 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI) is usually  concerned  with 
single-channel  grayscale  images represented  as 3D scalar matrices  of 
voxels, namely  volumetric  pixels, distributed  on a 3D regular  grid 
( Zwanenburg  et al., 2016 ). The voxel value is proportional  to the MR 
signal intensity  of the appropriate  acquired  portion  of the space, which 
is representative  of the characteristics  of the biological  tissue at that 
point ( Cercignani  et al., 2021 ). MR images have a variable  contrast  and 
resolution  depending  on diﬀerent  factors such as the parameters  of se- 
quence,  the magnetic  ﬁeld strength,  and the scan time of the acquisi-  
tion ( Symms,  2004; Bloomﬁeld  et al., 2017 ). One of the most widely 
used MR images is the 3D T1-weighted  (T1-w) image ( Ai et al., 2021 ). 
The T1-w images show an excellent  contrast  between  the main brain 
structure  as white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal  
ﬂuid (CSF) ( Bloomﬁeld  et al., 2017 ; Yan et al. (2020) ). The T1-w acqui- 
sition sequences  are designed  to weigh the image on the T1 relaxation  
time, characteristic  of the tissue type ( Stanisz et al., 2005 ). Tissues  with a longer relaxation  time, such as CSF, have a lower signal and there- 
fore have a darker color ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Instead,  WM has a more 
intense  signal and therefore  has a color tending  to white. The GM has 
an intermediate  signal between  WM and CSF that has a grayish  color 
( Henderson,  1983 ). In Fig. 1 .A are shown 5 slices of a T1-w brain image 
in axial projection.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14582, 14587), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1599, 1605), match='\n2.2. '>"

model during screening  session 
All participants  included  in this analysis  reported  hot-burning  pain 
in response  to the C-HP model. For participants  in study 2 ( n = 32), the 
time course for pain intensity  ratings during the screening  session shows 
an ever-increasing  trend during the C-HP exposure,  which responded  
positively  to 0.5 °C step increases  at each arrow ( Fig. 2 A). The ther- 
mode temperature  for the MRI scan was tailored  for each participant,  
and once increased  to the target temperature,  remained  stable during 
the MRI sessions.  Further,  in study 2 ( n = 32), exposure  to the C-HP 
model induced  profound  heat allodynia  which lasted at least 75 min 
after capsaicin  removal  ( F = 11.28; p < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 B). HPTs after cap- 
saicin removal  were all signiﬁcantly  lower than pre-capsaicin  exposure  
HPTs ( t ≤ − 7.8; p ≤ 10 − 8 ) and the ﬁrst HPTs after C-HP removal  were 
lower than baseline  WDTs ( t = − 4.5; p = 8.4 ×10 − 5 ), demonstrating  pro- 
found hypersensitivity  to heat after C-HP exposure.  Using SF-MPQ-2  
descriptors,  most participants  described  the pain as throbbing,  aching,  
heavy, tender, shooting,  stabbing,  sharp, piercing,  sensitive  to touch, 
hot-burning  and tingling  ( Fig. 2 C). After removing  the descriptor  ‘hot- 
burning’  from the analysis,  we found a signiﬁcant  eﬀect of pain descrip-  
tor class ( F = 9.17; p < 0.0001)  and no eﬀect of sex on participants’  ratings 
on the SF-MPQ-2  ( F = 0.18; p = 0.67). Participants  rated both inter- 
mittent  and continuous  pain descriptors  higher than either neuropathic  
or aﬀective  pain descriptors  (Continuous  > Aﬀective:  t = 4.0; p < 0.001; 
Intermittent  > Aﬀective:  t = 4.0; p < 0.001; Continuous  > Neuropathic:  
t = 4.1; p < 0.001; Intermittent  > Neuropathic:  t = 4.1; p < 0.001).  There 
was no diﬀerence  in ratings between  continuous  and intermittent  de- 
scriptors,  and neuropathic  and aﬀective  descriptors  ( t < 0.13; p > 0.98). 
During the MRI experiment,  during the two minutes  immediately  after 
the corresponding  tonic pain resting state scan average  pain intensity  of 
the group was rated as 33 (SD = 21) on a 0–100 point scale with a range 
of 1–75.",\n?Resource | \n?3\.1\.\s*?\n?,"<re.Match object; span=(35186, 35192), match=' \n3.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2323, 2328), match='\n3.2.'>"

Using University  of Southern  California’s  Laboratory  of Neuroimag-  
ing (LONI) Pipeline,  we applied  FSL’s (v6.3 ) eddy-current  and motion 
correction,  brain extraction  tool, and resampling  to isotropic  resolu- 
tion of 2mm 3 ( Dinov et al., 2009 ; Smith et al., 2004 ). We used MR- 
trix ( v3.1) to compute  fractional  anisotropy  (FA) and eigenvalue  images 
( Tournier  et al., 2019 ). With diﬀusion  images,  tensors are estimated  for 
each participant  and a whole brain fractional  anisotropy  image is cre- 
ated. Our atlas of the right and left LC nuclei was obtained  from a LC 
meta-mask  ( Dahl et al., 2022 ) and the right and left noradrenergic  bun- 
dles from Tang et al. (2020).  As control regions,  we utilized  the pre- 
viously  deﬁned  right and left frontopontine  tracts ( Tang et al., 2018 ), 
which run along the ventral portion  of the pons on either side of the 
basilar sulcus, terminating  at the pontine  nuclei Fig. 1 . displays  all three 
ROIs in MNI152  linear, 1 mm resolution  space. 
Both fractional  anisotropy  and atlas images were registered  into 
MNI152  linear, 1 mm brain space. Using ANTS nonlinear  registration  
( Avants et al., 2008 ; Sun et al., 2020 ) the atlases were then backwarped  
into individual  subject space with nearest  neighbor  interpolation.  Reg- 
istration  quality was visualized  using an in-house  MATLAB  script ( MAT- 
LAB ver. R2019a  ). After accurate  atlas registration  to individual  subject 
space was conﬁrmed  with visual inspection,  mean and radial diﬀusion  
images were created  from eigenvalue  images in MATLAB  with custom  
scripts. Atlases were then converted  into a binary mask and multiplied  
by the diﬀusion  image to provide  fractional  anisotropy,  mean, and radial 
diﬀusivity  values along the atlases,  per voxel, within the native space. 
Diﬀusivity  values were then averaged  to provide  one diﬀusivity  value 
per participant  within each ROI. 
Since the noradrenergic  bundle overlaps  with a portion  of the LC at- 
las, we conducted  an along-tract  analysis  of fractional  anisotropy  of the 
noradrenergic  bundle.  50 equidistant  points were imposed  along the no- 
radrenergic  bundle as discussed  elsewhere  ( Sun et al., 2020 ). Each point 
was averaged  across participants  within younger  or older adult groups.  
Though  the 50 equidistant  points do not represent  distinct  anatomical  
regions,  based on subject registrations,  we can approximate  the ﬁrst 10 
points to represent  most of the LC and points 30–50 represent  areas of 
the entorhinal  cortex. Fractional  anisotropy  along the tract, is also rep- 
resented  visually  on the Y-axis, against  each of the 50 equidistant  points 
between  younger  and older adults, shown in Figs. 4 and 5 .",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9848, 9853), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2818, 2824), match='\n2.2. '>"

Twenty-four  adult participants  completed  the experiment.  Data from 
two participants  were excluded  due to technical  issue in eye-tracking  
data collection,  two more participants  were excluded  due to excessive  
head motion,  and three participants  were excluded  for excessive  drowsi-  
ness in the scanner  impacting  either the ability to collect eye tracking  
data or their behavioral  performance.  The ﬁnal sample size was n = 17 
(9 females  and 8 males),  each with no history of neurological  or psy- 
chiatric  disorder  and a full-scale  intelligence  quotient  (FSIQ) above 80. 
Power analysis  conducted  using G ∗ Power 3.1 ( Faul et al., 2009 ) (RRID : 
SCR_013726,  http://www.gpower.hhu.de/  ) demonstrated  that the ﬁnal 
sample had suﬃcient  power to detect the core eﬀects of interest  (see

We used the multi-modal  neuroimaging  data available  from the Hu- 
man Connectome  Project (HCP) ( Van Essen et al., 2013 ), which was 
acquired  using a 3T Siemens  ‘Connectom’  Skyra scanner  and included  
anatomical  T1-weighted  imaging,  structural  diﬀusion  MRI, and func- 
tional MRI data. Due to the computational  requirements  involved  in per- 
forming  rigorous  advanced  ﬁbre tractography,  we speciﬁcally  consid-  
ered 50 subjects  (Age range: 22-35, 29 females)  from the WU-Minn  HC 
( Van Essen et al., 2013 ) as a balance  between  computational  demands  
and a suitable  number  of subjects  to characterise  group behaviour.  The 
high resolution  T1-weighted  data were acquired  with 0.7 mm isotropic  
resolution,  TR/TE = 2400/2.14  ms, and ﬂip angle = 8°. The diﬀu- 
sion MRI protocol  consisted  of three diﬀusion-weighted  shells (b-values:  
1000, 2000 and 3000 s/mm 2 , with 90 diﬀusion-weighting  directions  in 
each shell) and 18 reference  volumes  (b = 0 s/mm 2 ). Each diﬀusion-  
weighted  image was acquired  twice, with opposite  phase-encoded  di- 
rection to correct for image distortion  ( Andersson  et al., 2003 ). The 
diﬀusion  MRI data was acquired  with 1.25 mm isotropic  resolution,  
TR/TE = 5520/89.5  ms, and ﬂip angle = 78°. For more details about 
the acquisition  protocol,  please refer to Van Essen et al., 2013 . For each 
subject,  14mins  of resting state fMRI data were acquired  using multi- 
band gradient-echo  imaging  (TR = 720ms,  echo time = 33.1ms,  multi- 
band factor = 8, ﬂip angle = 52 o , ﬁeld of view = 208 ×180mm,  ma- trix = 108 ×109, 2mm isotropic  voxels with 72 slices, alternate  phase

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119703,"2.1. Datasets  
2.1.1. CerebNet  dataset 
We assemble  a diverse  cerebellum  sub-segmentation  dataset for 
training,  validation  and testing of models based on acquisitions  from on- 
going observational  studies.  This superset  includes  participants  equally  
distributed  between  healthy  controls  as well as pre-ataxic  and ataxic 
SCA3 mutation  carriers,  thereby  covering  a broad range of diﬀerent  de- 
grees of cerebellar  atrophy.  
Participants  32 T1-weighted  MRI of SCA3 mutation  carriers  and 
healthy  controls  were acquired  at 4 sites: Bonn and Aachen,  Germany,  
Nijmegen,  The Netherlands  and Minneapolis,  MN, US. All participants  
provided  written  informed  consent  according  to the guidelines  set by 
the local institutional  review boards.  Two cases with visible motion ar- 
tifacts were excluded,  resulting  in the ﬁnal CerebNet  dataset of 20 SCA3 
mutation  carriers,  covering  the whole disease  course of SCA3 from early 
pre-ataxic  to late ataxic disease  stages, and 10 healthy  controls  of the 
same age range. In Table 1 , we report demographics  (age, sex) and 
ataxia severity,  assessed  with the Scale for Assessment  and Rating of 
Ataxia (SARA)  ( Schmitz-Hübsch  et al., 2006 ) for the three groups.  For 
SCA3 mutation  carriers,  we also report the CAG repeat length. To divide 
SCA3 mutation  carriers  into pre-ataxic  (SARA < 3 , 𝑁 = 11 ) and ataxic 
individuals  (SARA ≥ 3 , 𝑁 = 9 ), we follow the established  SARA cut-oﬀ
value of 3, corresponding  to the mean plus 2 standard  deviations  of the 
healthy  control group distribution  from the original  SARA validation  
study ( Schmitz-Hübsch  et al., 2006 ). 
MRI scans All T1-weighted  MRI were acquired  as MPRAGE  on 3T 
SIEMENS  scanners  (Siemens  Medical  Systems,  Erlangen,  Germany).  All 
scans share an isotropic  resolution  of 1mm, FOV 256 ×256 and 192 
slices, acquired  in sagittal  direction  with a 32-channel  head coil. Bonn 
( 𝑁 = 16 , Skyra), Minnesota  ( 𝑁 = 7 , Prisma Fit), and Aachen  ( 𝑁 = 4 , 
Prisma)  acquired  at TR = 2500ms,  TE = 4.37ms,  TI = 1100ms,  FA = 7°, 
while Nijmegen  ( 𝑁 = 4 , Trio) acquired  at TR = 2300ms,  TE = 3.03ms,  
TI = 1100ms,  FA = 8°. 
Segmentation  Protocol  Following  the Schmahmann  atlas 
( Schmahmann  et al., 1999 ) as anatomical  reference,  we deﬁne 27 
disjoint  macroscopic  subsegments  of the cerebellum.  In addition  to 20 
hemispheric  lobules  (10 for each hemisphere),  we include  5 vermis 
labels and two CWM labels (left and right). The cerebellar  segmentation  
is divided  into 6 hierarchical  steps, gradually  moving  from large-scale  
structures  to the subdivision  of cerebellar  lobules.  First, we delineate  
the CGM cortex with an exact outer boundary  separating  CGM from 
cerebrospinal  ﬂuid and other subtentorial  structures,  such as cranial 
nerves ( Step 1 ). In this step, any inwardly  projecting  CWM branches  are 
ignored.  Subsequently,  the four lobes ( Step 2 ), and the vermis ( Step 3 ) 
are segmented.  We conduct  the sub-segmentation  of the hemispheric  
lobules  ( Step 4 ) as well as the subdivision  of the vermis ( Step 5 ). Finally,  
the ﬁne delineation  of the CWM including  its branches  into the CGM 
cortex band and a consistent  boundary  towards  the brainstem  is drawn 
( Step 6 ). The detailed  protocol  is publicly  available  for reproducibility  
( Heinz et al., 2022 ). 
Manual  Reference  Standard  The correct subdivision  of the cerebel-  
lar cortex into lobules  is critical,  since the cerebellum  shows a high 
morphological  variability  of its anatomical  structure  ( Fig. 1 ). At the 
isotropic  resolution  of 1mm, it remains  challenging  to precisely  deter- 
mine whether  a single small folia or branch belongs  to one or an adja-

cent lobule. To address  this, all lobular  boundaries  within the cerebel-  
lar cortex ( Step 1-5 ) are subsegmented  by two experienced  raters on all 
MRIs independently.  To unify diﬀerences  between  the two raters, cor- 
tex segmentations  are reviewed  by an interdisciplinary  team consisting  
of the experienced  raters as well as a neurologist  and a neuroradiolo-  
gist. A consensus  was reached  for all cases. Furthermore,  a team of four 
trained  raters delineated  the ﬁne-grained  CGM/CWM  boundary  ( Step 6 ). 
The ﬁnal consensus  segmentation  together  with the CWM delineations  
represents  the manual  reference  standard  for training,  validation,  and 
testing of our method.  We split the participants  contained  in the ﬁnal 
reference  dataset into 18/4/8  for training,  validation,  and testing.  For 
individual  splits, we preserve  the distribution  of controls,  pre-ataxic  and 
ataxic participants.  
2.1.2. Cross-study  pre-training  dataset 
For pre-training  purposes,  we compile  a dataset of 160 T1-weighted  
images gathered  from the Autism Brain Imaging  Data Exchange  II 
(ABIDE  II) ( Di Martino  et al., 2017 ), the Alzheimers  Disease  Neu- 
roimaging  Initiative  (ADNI)  ( Mueller  et al., 2005 ), the UCLA Consortium  
for Neuropsychiatric  Phenomics  LA5c Study (LA5c) ( Poldrack  et al., 
2016 ), the Open Access Series of Imaging  Studies  1 and 2 (OASIS-  
1 3 ( Marcus  et al., 2007 ) and OASIS-2  ( Marcus  et al., 2010 )), and the 
Minimal  Interval  Resonance  Imaging  in Alzheimers  Disease  (MIRIAD)  
( Malone  et al., 2013 ). For these 160 cases, we automatically  generate  
cerebellar  sub-segmentation  labels using SUIT v3.3 ( Diedrichsen,  2006; 
Diedrichsen  et al., 2009 ). SUIT is an atlas-based  segmentation  tool which 
3 Excluding  cases from the OASIS-1  reliability  section. provides  segmentations  of 28 sub-regions  of the cerebellar  cortex at the 
level of cerebellar  lobules  and a sub-segmentation  of the vermis accord-  
ing to the Schmahmann  atlas ( Schmahmann  et al., 1999 ). Since SUIT 
does not provide  segmentations  for CWM, we additionally  process  all 
160 images with FreeSurfer  (FS) ( Fischl et al., 2002 ) and merge FS- 
generated  CWM with the cerebellar  sub-regions  labels from SUIT. Gaps 
between  cerebellar  CWM and CGM are resolved  by mapping  them to the 
nearest  CGM structure.  The compiled  external  dataset is split into 140 
training  and 20 validation  cases and is exclusively  used for pre-training  
of our model. 
2.1.3. Deformation  dataset for augmentation  
To increase  variability  of our training  data, we generate  realistic  
non-linear  deformations  for data augmentation.  For this we generated  
an auxiliary  dataset of 100 cases selected  from ABIDE II ( Di Mar- 
tino et al., 2017 ), ADNI ( Mueller  et al., 2005 ), LA5c ( Poldrack  et al., 
2016 ), OASIS-1  3 ( Marcus  et al., 2007 ) and OASIS-2  ( Marcus  et al., 
2010 ), MIRIAD  ( Malone  et al., 2013 ), and the Human  Connectome  
Project (HCP) ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ). 
2.1.4. Test-retest  dataset 
We use the OASIS-1  (reliability  subset) ( Marcus  et al., 2007 ) and 
Kirby ( Landman  et al., 2011 ) datasets  for test-retest  analysis.  OASIS-1  
contains  20 participants  that were scanned  no more than 90 days apart 
(all except 5 less than 30 days). The Kirby dataset consists  of scan-rescan

Participants  aged 18-55 were recruited  via the Depression  and Anx- 
iety Center for Discovery  and Treatment,  Icahn School of Medicine  at 
Mount Sinai (ISMMS).  Subjects  were recruited  from web-based  adver- 
tising, ﬂyers or clinician  referrals.  Participants  with mood and anxiety  
(MA) disorders  were included  if they met criteria  for major depressive  
disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  or both, as determined  by the 
Structured  Clinical  Interview  for DSM-5,  performed  by a trained  clinical  
rater. MA participants  were allowed  comorbidities  of other anxiety,  de- 
pressive  or stress-related  disorders,  as is highly common  in MA subjects  
( Aina and Susman,  2006 ; Lamers  et al., 2011 ), but were not included  if 
they had other psychiatric  disorders  such as obsessive-compulsive  dis- 
order, substance  or alcohol  use disorder,  schizophrenia.  Healthy  control 
subjects  were free of any current  or past psychiatric  disorder.  All sub- 
jects were free from a history of current  or past neurological  disorder,  
signiﬁcant  head injury, or medications  with known antidepressant  or 
anxiolytic  eﬀects at the time of the scan. Individuals  who met all inclu- 
sion and exclusion  criteria  were enrolled  in the study and completed  an 
MRI scan, self-reported  measures  of symptoms  and a cognitive  test of 
intrinsic  and extrinsic  motivation  on the same day. Self-reported  symp- 
tom measures  were performed  via a web-based  questionnaire  system 
(Redcap)  and included  demographic  information  as well as key ques- 
tionnaires  assessing  anhedonia:  the Temporal  Experience  of Please Scale 
(TEPS);  and anxiety  symptoms:  State-Trait  Cognitive  and Somatic  Anx- 
iety (STICSA).  General  depression  was also assessed  with the Quick In- 
ventory  for Depression  Scale (QIDS).  The study was approved  by the IS- 
MMS Institutional  Review  Board, all subjects  provided  written  informed  
consent  and were compensated  for their time. 
Fifty-one  subjects  were scanned  in total. Of those, 8 were excluded  
due to technical  error, motion or incomplete  scanning.  Motion  was de- termined  via visual inspection  of images,  judgement  of image blurri- 
ness and/or visible subject motion during scanning  that was not rec- 
tiﬁed by repeat scan. This left 43 for analysis,  comprising  22 HC 
(age = 30.9 ± 8.6; 7 male) and 21 MA participants  (age = 30.5 ± 8.6; 
11 male). Of the 21 MA subjects,  11 had primary  MDD with 6 of those 
having a comorbid  anxiety  disorder,  and 10 had primary  GAD with 7 
having a comorbid  depressive  disorder,  as determined  by the SCID. See

cessed dataset.  Informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants  
and all study protocols  and procedures  were approved  by the Wash- 
ington University  Institutional  Review  Board. Data were collected  on a 
Siemens  3T Connectom  Skyra with a 32-channel  head coil. A detailed  de- 
scription  of acquisition  protocols  can be found elsewhere  ( Glasser  et al., 
2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ). Brieﬂy,  rs-fMRI  data were acquired  in 4 
sessions  over 2 days, (scan duration  14:33 min) with a gradient-echo-  
planar imaging  sequence,  with TR = 720 ms, TE = 33.1 ms, ﬂip angle of 
52°, 2 mm isotropic  voxel resolution  and a multiband  factor of 8. Par- 
ticipants  were instructed  to keep eyes open and ﬁxated on a cross. A 
subset of 92 unrelated  participants,  part of the HCP 100 unrelated  sub- 
jects release,  for which complete  processed  data was available  for all 
four scans, were utilized  in primary  analyses.  Scans were excluded  from 
analysis  based on a set of summary  motion measurements  ( Parkes et al., 
2018 ) derived  from motion correction  preprocessing  and provided  in 
the HCP database.  Motion  spikes were deﬁned  as a relative  root-mean-  
square (RMS) movement  of 0.25 mm or above. Scans were excluded  
from analysis  if at least one of the following  conditions  were met: greater 
than 15% of time points were marked  as a motion spikes; the average  
relative  RMS motion greater than 0.2 mm; a spike larger than 5 mm was 
present.  These criteria  resulted  in eight subjects  with an incomplete  set 
of fMRI scans, and therefore  excluded  from the present  study.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10304, 10309), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1797, 1803), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118952,"2.1. AUSFIDE-based  3D qBOLD 
One key challenge  that currently  practiced  qBOLD techniques  face is 
separation  of the four competing  mechanisms  that aﬀect temporal  signal 
decays across echoes collected:  R 2 (microscopic),  R 2 ′ from heme (R 2 ′ ,h ) 
and non-heme  (R 2 ′ ,nh ) iron contributions  (mesoscopic),  and background  
magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogeneity  ( ΔB 0 ; macroscopic).  Further,  extracting  
Y v and DBV from the measured  R 2 ′ ,h is generally  nontrivial  as noted in 
Introduction.  The following  subsections  along with Fig. 1 detail the pro- 
posed approach  in terms of data acquisition  and parameter  estimation  
so as to disentangle  the above confounders  and thereby  achieving  reli- 
able measurements  of the qBOLD parameters.  Symbols  used to represent  
parameters  and their corresponding  descriptions  are listed in Table 1 . 
2.1.1. Estimation  of preliminary  parameters  
The proposed  3D qBOLD protocol  consists  of two pulse sequences:  
AUSFIDE  ( Fig. 1 a) yielding  a set of volumetric  maps (R 2 , R 2 ′ , Δ𝜒, ΔB 0 ; 
Fig. 1 c), and additionally  VS-VSL  ( Fig. 1 b) leading  to voxel-wise  CBV v 
estimates  ( Fig. 1 d) across the entire brain. 
Based on the unbalanced  steady-state-free-precession  (SSFP) mech- 
anism ( Scheﬄer,  1999 ) generating  steady-state  signals in a number  of 
spin conﬁgurations,  AUSFIDE  deploys  SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO  mod- 
ules in an alternating  and time-symmetric  fashion  along the entire pulse 
train ( Fig. 1 a) for selective  acquisition  of SSFP signals in the 0th and - 
1st spin pathways,  respectively,  with a plurality  of gradient-recalled  sig- 
nals within each time-of-repetition  (TR). The decay rate of SSFP-FID  and 
SSFP-ECHO  signals along time is then expressed  by R 2 + R 2 ′ ( = R 2 ∗ ) and 
R 2 -R 2 ′ , respectively,  while temporal  evolution  of signal phase therein  is 
governed  by magnetic  ﬁelds both at voxel and larger scales. Thus, AUS- 
FIDE enables  quantiﬁcation  of R 2 and R 2 ′ from magnitude  data process-  
ing ( Fig. 1 c), and Δ𝜒and ΔB 0 from phase analysis  ( Fig. 1 d) (see Eq. [2] 
below for signal modeling).  This is a key advantage  over the currently  
practiced  qBOLD pulse sequences.  On one hand, compared  to the 2D- 
limited R 2 ′ measurement  techniques,  AUSIFDE  achieves  rapid 3D volu- 
metric scanning,  thus allowing  for additional  estimation  of Δ𝜒via QSM. 
On the other hand, compared  to multi-echo  3D spoiled  GRE, AUSIFDE  
is able to separate  R 2 ∗ into R 2 and R 2 ′ contributions  directly.  Additional  
components  in the AUSFIDE  sequence  include  3D z-shimming  gradients  
along the multi-echo  train ( Han et al., 2015 ) and the radial stack-of-  
stars k-space  sampling  scheme  ( Block et al., 2014 ) so as to make the R 2 ′

Fig. 1. Schematic  of the proposed,  three-step  quantiﬁcation  of qBOLD parameters.  Step I. Data acquisition:  Imaging  data are collected  in two separate  scans using 
‘Alternating  Unbalanced  Steady-state-free-precession  (SSFP) Free-Induction-Decay  and Echo (AUSFIDE)’  (a) and ‘Velocity-Selective  Venous-Spin-Labeling  (VS-VSL)’  
(b) pulse sequences.  In AUSFIDE,  the SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO  modules  alternate  with each other across the entire pulse train while sampling  multiple  echoes 
decaying  with rate constants  R 2 + R 2 ′ and R 2 -R 2 ′ , respectively.  The VS-VSL method achieves  ΔB 0 -resistant,  selective  labeling  of venous blood by applying  saturation,  
inversion,  and VS modules  sequentially  before 3D fast spin-echo  readout.  Step II. Prior estimation:  The AUSIFDE  data are processed  in magnitude  and phase, leading 
to maps of R 2 and R 2 ′ (c) and Δ𝜔 0 ( = 𝛾ΔB 0 ) and Δ𝜒(d), respectively,  while the diﬀerence  between  control and tag VS-VSL images approximates  CBV v (e). Step III. 
qBOLD parameter  mapping:  Given acquired  time-series  AUSFIDE  images and preliminary  parametric  maps derived therefrom,  along with CBV v prior information,  
the constrained  nonlinear  inverse problem  in Eq. [6] is solved, yielding  solutions  for qBOLD parameters  (DBV and Y v ) and nonblood  contributions  to R 2 ′ and Δ𝜒
(see main text for details).  
mapping  relatively  immune  to large-scale  magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogeneity  
and physiologic  bulk ﬂuid motion,  respectively  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2021 ). 
In the VS-VSL  pulse sequence  ( Fig. 1 b), two magnetization  prepara-  
tion modules  are sequentially  applied  to respective  spatial positions  to 
null signals for both upstream  arterial  blood and cerebrospinal-ﬂuid,  fol- 
lowed by a control/tag  VS pulse train to sensitize  moving  spins, thereby  
ensuring  labeling  of venous blood only. Subsequently,  single-slab  3D 
fast SE with variable  refocusing  ﬂip angles and center-out  k-space  view 
ordering  schemes  is employed  to achieve  rapid and ΔB 0 -insensitive  sig- 
nal readout  with a minimal  loss of the labeled  venous blood population.  
In the quantiﬁcation,  a simpliﬁed  VS-VSL  signal model yields CBV v di- 
rectly from control/tag  diﬀerence  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2020 ). 
2.1.2. Prior-constrained  qBOLD model 
In the absence  of blood vessel network,  the signal evolution  of SSFP- 
FID (S F ) and SSFP-ECHO  (S E ) modules  in AUSFIDE  can be written  as: 
{ 𝑆 𝐹 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )= 𝑆 0 𝑒 −( 𝑅 2 + 𝑅 ′
2 ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )𝑒 − 𝑗Φ
𝑆 𝐸 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )= 𝜂𝑆 0 𝑒 ( 𝑅 2 − 𝑅 ′
2 ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (−Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )𝑒 𝑗Φ(2) 
where the subscripts  F and E represent  SSFP-FID  and SSFP-ECHO,  TE is 
the echo time, S 0 is the baseline  steady-state  signal level of SSFP-FID,  
𝜂is the ratio of S E to S F at TE = 0, F VSF is the voxel-spread-function  
representing  ΔB 0 -induced  voxel signal modulations  ( Yablonskiy  et al., 
2013b ), and Φis the signal phase as a function  of total magnetic  ﬁeld 
(i.e., ΔB 0 + Δ𝜒-induced  local ﬁeld). Given the estimates  of ΔB 0 and the resultant  F VSF , the unknown  parameters  in Eq. [2], S 0 , 𝜂, R 2 , and R 2 ′ , 
can be jointly estimated  ( Lee and Wehrli,  2021 ). 
In the presence  of a blood vessel network,  heme iron and non-heme  
iron both perturb  local magnetic  ﬁeld, altering  the transverse  relaxation  
rate R 2 ′ made up of R ′ 2,h + R ′ 2,nh . In the qBOLD framework  aiming to re- 
solve the dHb-related  R 2 ′ (R ′ 2,h ) into Y v and DBV, the two sources  of R 2 ′ 
modulation  thus needs to be separately  taken into account.  Accordingly,  
Eq. [2] is modiﬁed  to: 
{ 𝑆 𝐹 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )= 𝑆 0 𝑒 −( 𝑅 2 + 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 𝛿𝜔 ) 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐹 )𝑒 − 𝑗Φ
𝑆 𝐸 (𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )= 𝜂𝑆 0 𝑒 ( 𝑅 2 − 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ ) 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 𝛿𝜔 ) 𝐹 𝑉 𝑆𝐹 (−Δ𝐵 0 , 𝑇 𝐸 𝐸 )𝑒 𝑗Φ(3) 
Here, the term 𝑒 − 𝜁⋅𝑓( ⋅) is the qBOLD model representing  the eﬀect of 
dHb on the extravascular  tissue signal, 𝜁is DBV, and f( • ) characterizes  
the rate of signal decay as quadratic  and linear functions  of its argu- 
ment asymptotically  at short and long TEs, respectively  ( Yablonskiy  and 
Haacke,  1994 ). 𝛿𝜔 is the characteristic  frequency  due to the susceptibil-  
ity of deoxygenated  blood relative  to the surrounding  tissue, expressed  
by ( Cho et al., 2018 ; Yablonskiy  et al., 2013a ):

where 𝛾is the gyromagnetic  ratio, 𝐵 0 is the static ﬁeld strength,  Δ𝜒0 is 
the susceptibility  diﬀerence  between  fully oxygenated  and fully deoxy- 
genated  red blood cells ( ∼4 𝜋×0 . 27 ppm ( Spees et al., 2001 )), and Hct

blood, which can be calculated  by volume-weighted  combination  of sus-

To estimate  the qBOLD parameters  (Y v and DBV), AUSFIDE  im- 
ages along the multi-echo  train may be ﬁtted directly  to the signal 
model in Eq. [3], which, however,  makes the problem  computation-  
ally intensive  and potentially  unstable  because  of many unknowns  
( 𝑆 0 , 𝜂, 𝑅 2 , 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ , 𝜒𝑛𝑏 , 𝑌 𝑣 , 𝜁) being solved jointly.  Instead,  the solutions  
can be found in two steps: 1) estimating  S 0 , 𝜂, R 2 , and R 2 ′ using Eq. [2], 
and based on this information,  2) seeking  the remaining  parameters  by 
solving  the following  nonlinear  least-squares  problem:  
argmin 
𝚯∑
𝑇𝐸 |𝐲 ( 𝑇 𝐸 ) − 𝚵( 𝚯, 𝑇 𝐸) |2 (5) 
where y is the acquired  AUSFIDE  signals at the sampling  time TE for 
each voxel, 𝚵= { |𝑆 𝐹 |, |𝑆 𝐸 |} is the corresponding  model (Eq. [3]), and 
𝜽= { 𝑌 𝑣 , 𝜁, 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ , 𝜒𝑛𝑏 } is the set of unknown  parameters  to be solved. 
Furthermore,  to enhance  solution  accuracy  while reducing  noise am- 
pliﬁcations  in the parameter  estimation,  R 2 ′ and Δ𝜒obtainable  from 
magnitude  and phase processing  of the AUSFIDE  data are utilized  as 
prior information,  leading  to the following  optimization  problem:  
argmin 
𝚯∑
𝑇𝐸 |𝐲 ( 𝑇 𝐸 ) − 𝚵( 𝚯, 𝑇 𝐸) |2 + 𝑤 |Δ𝜒− Ψ( 𝚯) |2 + 𝑝 |||𝑅 ′
2 − Y ( 𝚯) |||2 (6) 
Here, Ψdecomposes  Δ𝜒into susceptibility  contributions  of the four 
compartments  in a voxel, i.e., deoxygenated  arterial  and venous blood, 
fully oxygenated  blood, and non-blood  tissue, given by ( Zhang et al., 
2015 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ):

1 − 𝜁
𝛼) 
𝜒𝑛𝑏 (7) 
where 𝛼is the volume  fraction  of venous blood relative  to total blood, 
assumed  to be 0.77 ( An and Lin, 2002 ). In Eq. [6], Y disentangles  R 2 ′ 
contributions  from the non-heme  iron ( 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ ) and dHb ( 𝑅 ′
2 ,ℎ ), written  
by: 
Y = 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ + 𝑅 ′
2 ,ℎ = 𝑅 ′
2 ,𝑛ℎ + 𝜁⋅𝛿𝜔 (𝑌 𝑣 , 𝜒𝑛𝑏 )(8) 
and w and p are the regularization  parameters  that enforce  prior knowl- 
edge of Δ𝜒and R 2 ′ , respectively.  Thus, with w = p = 0 Eq. [6] represents  the original  qBOLD problem,  while with w > 0 but p = 0 it is equivalent  
to the qBOLD + QSM approach.  
Additionally,  based on the recent analysis  ( Lee et al., 2018 ) suggest-  
ing substantially  improved  stability  of the qBOLD mapping  with prior in- 
formation  for DBV, in this work VS-VSL-derived  CBV v was employed  to 
initialize  and constrain  the solution  of DBV. Nevertheless,  since the VS- 
VSL method  may result in measurement  errors in some voxels in which 
its assumptions  are not valid ( Lee and Wehrli,  2020 ), here DBV was re- 
ﬁned during the iterative  process  of solving  Eq. [6], rather than being 
ﬁxed to CBV v . Details in solving  Eq. [6] are provided  in Section  2.4.1 be-

blob/main/individualization/Individualization.py  . 
2.4. Preprocessing  
We chose a preprocessing  pipeline  in accordance  with our previous  
work benchmarking  preprocessing  pipelines  in data from young chil- 
dren ( Graﬀet  al., 2022 ). All preprocessing  was carried out using custom  
Python scripts that integrated  Nipype  functionality  ( Gorgolewski  et al., 
2011 ) using FSL version  6.0.0 ( Smith et al., 2004 ), ANTs version  3.0.0.0 
( Avants et al., 2011 ), and AFNI version  18.3.03  ( Cox, 1996 ). We prepro-  
cessed scans from the same individual  separately.  
EPI data preprocessing  consisted  of slice time correction,  rigid body 
realignment,  and skull stripping  using FSL slicetimer,  FSL MCFLIRT,  
and FSL BET respectively,  a linear regression  to remove  the mean and 
linear and quadratic  trends from each voxel, bandpass  temporal  ﬁl- 
tering (0.01 –0 . 0 8 Hz), and nuisance  regression.  We regressed  out 
the six head motion parameters,  along with the white matter,  cere- 
brospinal  ﬂuid, and global signal; both linear and quadratic  terms were 
included,  along with their temporal  derivatives  (4 regressors  per param- 
eter). Censoring  was carried out as part of the regression  step, where 
we censored  volumes  above a FD threshold  of 0.25 mm (based on FSL 
MCFLIRT)  and censored  only the identiﬁed  frames.  After censoring,  our 
shortest  scan had 273 volumes;  for all other scans volumes  274 on- 
ward (of volumes  uncensored)  were removed  to match scan lengths.  
As not only amount  but location  of censored  volumes  inﬂuences  con- 
nectome  stability  ( Power et al., 2015 ), we carried out a control analy- 
sis using an alternate  volume-length  matching  approach  where the 18- 
minute scan was divided  into 4.5-minute  quartiles,  and for each par- 
ticipant  their 273 volumes  were chosen sequentially  from each quad- 
rant, from uncensored  volumes.  This allowed  a more even distribution  
of volumes  included  across the 18-minute  scan. We used ANTs Regis- 
tration ( Avants et al., 2011 ) to warp the EPI image to a study-speciﬁc  
2  K. Graﬀ, R. Tansey, S. Rai et al. NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119367 
EPI template  ( Huang et al., 2010 ). This template  was produced  by tak- 
ing a reference  volume  from each fMRI scan, chosen as a volume  of low 
motion approximately  in the middle of the scan, warping  these refer- 
ences to MNI space, then averaging  them together  and smoothing  with 
a Gaussian  kernel. We smoothed  the study-speciﬁc  template  with a ker- 
nel of 𝜎= 3.0 mm, as we found this kernel best addressed  the trade-oﬀ
between  retaining  anatomical  information  and compensating  for imper- 
fect registration  of the reference  volumes  to MNI space. Functional  data 
used in the analysis  were not spatially  smoothed  prior to connectome  
generation.  
2.5. Connectome  generation  
Following  preprocessing,  each voxel was assigned  to one of 1095 
nodes (parcels)  within the MIST ATOM parcellation  ( Urchs et al., 2019 ). 
We used the MIST parcellation  due to its inclusion  of subcortical  regions,  
including  the cerebellum.  Each node was assigned  to one of 12 brain 
networks,  as deﬁned  by the MIST 12 parcellation:  Basal ganglia  and 
thalamus  (for brevity,  hereafter  referred  to as BG/thalamus;  39 nodes),  
auditory  network  and posterior  insula (auditory  network;  49 nodes),  
mesolimbic  network  (153 nodes),  default mode network  lateral (lateral  
DMN; 48 nodes),  visual network  (110 nodes),  default mode network  
posteromedial  (posteromedial  DMN; 56 nodes),  somatomotor  network  
(53 nodes),  default mode network  anteromedial  and left angular  gyrus 
(anteromedial  DMN; 84 nodes),  ventral visual stream and dorsal visual 
stream (visual stream;  78 nodes),  frontoparietal  network  (157 nodes),  
ventral attention  network  and salience  network  (ventral  attention  net- 
work; 132 nodes),  and cerebellum  (136 nodes).  
The time courses  for voxels in each node were averaged,  reducing  
the brain to 1095 time courses.  The Pearson  correlation  between  every 
pair of nodes was calculated,  generating  598 965 edges, which were 
Fisher z-transformed  to approximate  a normal  distribution.

approach  used by Finn et al. (2015) and related work ( Byrge and 
Kennedy,  2019 ; Kaufmann  et al., 2017 ; Miranda-Domingeuz  et al., 
2018 ), connectomes  were vectorized  and then each pair of scans was 
correlated.  These correlations  were also Fisher z-transformed  prior to 
being included  in statistical  models.  Connectome  metrics  were then cal- 
culated  as follows:  
1 Longitudinal  self-stability  was assessed  as the correlation  between  a 
participant’s  original  and follow up scan. 
2 Average-between-subject-similarity  was assessed  using the mean of 
each participant’s  correlation  to all scans from other participants.  
Both original  and follow-up  scans were used to generate  this aver- 
age (i.e., for each participant,  this value is an average  of 2 ×144 = 288 
correlations).  We considered  original  and follow-up  scans separately  
in a second model (see 2.8 . below).  
3 Developmental  individualization  was assessed  through  two metrics:  
a The ﬁngerprinting  match rate was calculated  by comparing  each 
scan against  every other scan and dividing  the number  of times 
a scan’s highest  correlation  was to the other scan from the same 
participant  by the total number  of scans, expressed  as a percent-  
age. Here we had 73 individuals,  each with two scans, for a de- 
nominator  of 146. Although  this metric has been used widely 
( Finn et al., 2015 ), it reduces  each scan to a binary score (match 
or no match),  thus limiting  its sensitivity,  and is necessarily  af- 
fected by sample size, since the larger the sample the more likely 
a scan will be compared  to a very similar scan ( Waller et al., 
2017 ). To address  this, we implemented  an additional  metric: 
b The diﬀerence  between  longitudinal  self-stability  and average-  
between-subject-similarity.  This metric can be thought  of as the 
extent to which a participant  is individualized  relative  to the group. We used this as our main developmental  individualiza-  
tion metric. 
Self-stability,  average-between-subject-similarity,  and developmen-  
tal individualization  were calculated  for the whole connectome  (all 598 
965 edges) and for the edges within individual  networks.  To account  
for diﬀerences  in network  size (number  of nodes in each network),  we 
conducted  network  size-matched  control analyses  by randomly  choos- 
ing 36 nodes (chosen  as it was close to but smaller  than the 39 nodes 
in our smallest  network)  from each network  and only using the (630) 
edges between  those nodes, sampled  1000 times. 
2.7. Cross-sectional  age associations  
We used a linear regression  to assess associations  between  age 
and self-stability,  average-between-subject-similarity,  and developmen-  
tal individualization.  For age, we used the participants’  average  of the 
age at the time of their initial scan and age at their follow up scan. 
We also included  motion (mean relative  FD, averaged  across the two 
scans), time between  scans, and sex as covariates.  Age associations  were 
calculated  for the entire connectome  and individual  networks.  As de- 
scribed  above, we also conducted  analyses  controlling  for network  size. 
For network-wise  analyses,  we used Bonferroni  correction  for multiple  
comparisons  across networks,  and present  levels of signiﬁcance  both 
with and without  the correction.  Since diﬀerent  networks  may have dif- 
ferent distributions  in the metric of interest  (independently  of age), we 
calculated  standardized  beta coeﬃcients.  Figures  also include  95% con- 
ﬁdence  intervals  around beta estimates.  
2.8. Longitudinal-between-subject-  similarity  analysis  
To assess changes  in similarity  with age, in addition  to using average-  
between-subject-similarity  in a cross-sectional  model, which parallels  
the individualization  and self-stability  models (i.e., with one value per 
participant),  we tested a second model. For each participant,  we calcu- 
lated mean between-subject-similarity  for both baseline  and follow-up  
scan separately  (giving two similarity  values for each participant,  rather 
than –as in Section  2.7 –one similarity  value per participant).  We then 
used a mixed-eﬀects  model to test the eﬀect of age on similarity,  includ- 
ing motion and sex as ﬁxed eﬀects and participant  identity  as a random  
eﬀect. 
2.9. Short-term  split-half  self-stability  
To facilitate  comparison  to prior work ( Vanderwal  et al., 2021 ; 
Kaufmann  et al., 2017 ), we examined  associations  between  age and 
short-term  self-stability  using mixed-eﬀects  models.  Short-term  self- 
stability  was assessed  using split-half  correlations:  for each scan we cal- 
culated  the functional  connectome  for the ﬁrst and second half of the 
scan separately,  then correlated  the vectorized  edges and Fisher z trans- 
formed  the result. Models  included  motion (mean relative  FD) and sex 
as ﬁxed eﬀects and participant  identity  as a random  eﬀect. 
To address  whether  short-term  self-stability  age eﬀects were driven 
by response  diﬀerences  between  the ﬁrst and second half of the scan or 
potential  autocorrelation  eﬀects, we carried out an additional  analysis  
where we randomly  divided  scan volumes  into two halves, randomized  
1000 times. We found the average  randomized  split-half  stability,  before 
carrying  out the same mixed eﬀects analysis.  
2.10. Magnitude  of longitudinal  change 
If longitudinal  stability  increases  with age, this may be related to the 
average  change in edge strength  (functional  connectivity;  FC) decreas-  
ing, i.e., a slowing  of developmental  changes.  To assess this, we calcu- 
lated the magnitude  of longitudinal  change by averaging  across edges 
the absolute  edge diﬀerences  for each participant’s  scan pairs, both for

Fig. 1. Summary  of methods.  The MIST ATOM parcellation  was applied separately  to both scans from each participant,  then functional  connectivity  was calculated  
between  all 1095 connectome  nodes. The 598 965 edges were then converted  into a vector. Between  all pairs of vectorized  connectomes  - both within and between  
participants  - the Pearson correlation  was calculated  to assess similarity.  For each participant,  metrics of interest were generated  from these similarity  values. 
Longitudinal  self-stability  was assessed  as the correlation  between  a participant’s  original and follow up scan (in ﬁgure, blue striped box). Short-term  self-stability  
was assessed  by dividing  scans into halves, generating  the functional  connectome  for the halves separately,  then calculating  the similarity  between  these halves 
(split green-white  boxes). Between-subject-similarity  was assessed  using the mean of each participant’s  correlation  to scans from other participants  (pink boxes), 
either using all correlations  from both scan 1 and scan 2 (average-between-subject-similarity)  or determining  scan 1 and scan 2 mean correlations  separately  
(longitudinal-between-subject-similarity).  Developmental  individualization  was assessed  as the diﬀerence  between  longitudinal  self-stability  and average-between-  
subject-similarity  (brown box).

to assess the eﬀect of age on magnitude  of longitudinal  change control-  
ling for motion,  time between  scans, and sex, identically  to other age 
models.  
2.11. Within- and between-network  eﬀects 
In an exploratory  analysis,  we considered  between-network  con- 
nections  for all pairs of networks.  We controlled  for network  size 
by randomly  choosing  18 nodes from each of the two networks  and 
only using the (18 ×18 = 324) edges between  those nodes, averaged  
over 1000 random  samplings.  In this analysis,  when assessing  within-  
network  we randomly  chose two sets of 18 nodes, giving an identi- 
cal 18 ×18 = 324 edges. Reported  p-values  are derived  from using 
the entire set of between-network  edges, rather than a random  subset. 
While we report p-values  with and without  multiple  comparison  cor- 
rection for transparency,  given the large number  of network-network  
pairs we caution  against  over interpreting  signiﬁcance  or lack of 
signiﬁcance.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(11483, 11511), match=' Data and code availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(13486, 13492), match='  \n3. '>"

Four participants  (details  in Table 1 ) from the CNS study 
( McCreary  et al., 2020 ) volunteered  for the QIB precision  sub-study  and 
were imaged  at four diﬀerent  time points (TP). At each time point, 3 re- 
peat scans (REP) were completed  for a total of 12 scans per participant  
( Fig. 1 ). Repeat scans were performed  over a short time span (mean ± 
SD: 12.6 ± 16.5 days). At TP1, the participants  mean age was 36.5 ± 11.7 
years. Subsequent  time points were completed  after a protocol  revision  
or a scheduled  scanner  hardware  or software  upgrades  (see Fig. 1 for 
details).  The study was reviewed  and approved  by the University  of Cal- 
gary Conjoint  Human  Research  Ethics Board. Written  informed  consent

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119294,"2.1. Datasets  and computational  models 
We sought to evaluate  the general  applicability  of feature-  
reweighted  RSA (FR-RSA),  both when (1) reweighting  individual  units 
of a computational  model, as has been done previously  with similar ap- 
proaches  (e.g. Peterson  et al., 2016 ; Jozwik et al., 2017 ; Storrs et al., 
2021 ) and (2) when reweighting  measurement  channels  of brain data, 
an approach  which to our knowledge  has not been carried out before. 
To this end, we used datasets  from several published  studies in which 
participants  had been exposed  to a range of object images ( Mur et al., 
2013 ; Cichy et al., 2016 , 2014 ; Bankson  et al., 2018 ; Cichy et al., 2019 ). 
The datasets  are centered  around four sets of natural  object images and 
reﬂect a combination  of functional  MRI data, magnetoencephalography  
data, and behavioral  similarity  judgments.  In addition,  for the object im- 
ages, we extracted  neural network  activations  as computational  models.  
Together,  this makes these datasets  well suited for evaluating  FR-RSA  
across a wide range of possible  analyses.  One of the published  studies 
( Bankson  et al., 2018 ) used a twin set of 84 natural  object images,  which 
were tested in separate  sets of participants  and which we thus treated 
as two separate  datasets.  Another  image set ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2008b ; 
Mur et al., 2013 ; Cichy et al., 2014 ) consisted  of 92 images of human 
and non-human  faces and bodies, as well as natural  and artiﬁcial  ob- 
jects. Finally,  another  image set ( Cichy et al., 2016 , 2019 ) consisted  of 
118 natural  images.  All datasets  used in this work were part of studies 
with approval  by their respective  local ethics committee.  Details regard-  
ing which kinds of data were available  for which image set, as well as 
the task carried out by participants,  can be found in Table 1 . 
2.1.1. fMRI data 
For the fMRI data associated  with two of the image sets (92 and 118), 
we used voxel-wise  beta estimates  for each object. These were provided  
with the publicly  available  datasets  and had been estimated  by applying  
a general  linear model to the preprocessed  data. The original  studies 
used a Siemens  3T Trio scanner  with a 32-channels  head coil and, for

from early visual cortex (EVC) and higher visual cortex (HVC). The number of participants,  n, for every measurement  modality  is stated in parentheses.  Note 
that not all available  datasets  from these image sets were used in all analyses,  given the exceedingly  large number of possible  comparisons.

TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 61°, FOV read = 192 mm, FOV phase = 100%, 
ascending  acquisition,  slice gap = 20%, resolution  = 3 mm 3 , slices = 33) 
(for further methodological  details,  see Cichy et al., 2014 ; 2016 ). For 
simplicity,  we focused  on early visual cortex (EVC) and higher visual 
cortex (HVC) as regions  of interest.  Since data were provided  in MNI 
space only, EVC and HVC were deﬁned  using anatomical  criteria,  based 
on a projection  of the Glasser  atlas to MNI space ( Glasser  et al., 2016 ). 
For EVC, we used a mask of areas V1, V2, and V3. For HVC, we used a 
mask consisting  of areas V8 (VO1), PIT, VVC, FFC, VMV1–3,  PHA1–3,  
TF, and TE2p. For each participant  and area, a conservative  preselection  
of voxels was conducted  by selecting  only the most strongly  activated  
250 voxels (post-hoc  analyses  including  all voxels showed  qualitatively  
similar yet overall slightly  weaker  results,  results not shown).  
2.1.2. MEG data 
While human MEG data were available  for all image sets, due to the 
extensive  number  of possible  comparisons,  we focused  on MEG data for 
image sets 92 and 118. Both MEG datasets  had been acquired  with 306 
channels  at a sampling  rate of 1000 Hz. Data were ﬁltered  between  0.03 
and 330 Hz and were baseline  corrected  (for methodological  details,  see 
Cichy et al., 2014 ; 2016 ). For image set 92, MEG signals were extracted  
for each trial for 100 ms before and 1200 ms after stimulus  presentation,  
resulting  in 1301 samples  in total. Across all measurement  channels,  this 
yielded  a data matrix of size 306 ×92 for every time point and partic- 
ipant. For the image set 118, MEG signals were extracted  for 100 ms 
before and 1000 ms after stimulus  presentation,  resulting  in 1101 sam- 
ples in total. This yielded  a data matrix of size 306 ×118 for every time 
point and participant.  
2.1.3. Behavioral  data 
The behavioral  data of all image sets included  in this study were 
sampled  using either the single ( Hout et al., 2013 ) or multiple  object 
arrangement  method  ( Kriegeskorte  & Mur, 2012 ). In those tasks, partic- 
ipants are required  to arrange  objects in a circular  arena according  to the 
perceived  dissimilarity  between  images by dragging-and-dropping  them 
to diﬀerent  locations  within the arena. Dissimilar  images are positioned  
further away from each other, while similar images are positioned  closer to each other. Importantly  for later analyses,  this method  directly  pro- 
duces fully-sampled  RDMs, rather than yielding  feature vectors  that are 
then converted  into RDMs. The single arrangement  method  was used 
for both image sets with 84 images,  while the multiple  arrangement  
method  was used for image sets 92 and 118. Further  details regarding  
the speciﬁcs  of behavioral  data acquisition  can be found in the original  
studies ( Mur et al., 2013 ; Bankson  et al., 2018 ; Cichy et al., 2019 ). 
2.1.4. Layer activations  from chosen deep neural networks  
We chose three popular  DNN architectures  for our investigation:  
AlexNet  ( Krizhevsky  et al., 2012 ), VGG-16  ( Simonyan  and Zisser- 
man, 2015 ), and ResNet-50  ( He et al., 2016 ). We used versions  of 
the DNNs that had been pre-trained  on the 1000 object classes used 
in the ImageNet  Large-Scale  Visual Recognition  Competition  (ILSVRC,  
Russakovsky  et al., 2015 ), implemented  in the Matlab toolbox  MatCon-  
vNet ( Vedaldi  and Lenc, 2015 ). 
For each DNN, we extracted  activity  patterns  for each image for a 
subset of DNN layers. For AlexNet,  we selected  all ﬁve pooling  lay- 
ers and the ﬁrst two fully-connected  layers, resulting  in seven layers 
in total. From early to late layers, these layers had 290,400,  186,624,  
64,896,  64,896,  43,264,  4096, and 4096 units, respectively.  Similarly,  
for VGG-16,  all ﬁve pooling  layers and the ﬁrst two fully connected  lay- 
ers were chosen.  From early to late layers, VGG-16  ′ s layers had 802,816,  
401,408,  200,704,  100,352,  25,088,  4096, and 4096 units, respectively.  
For ResNet-50,  layers conv1 (802,816  units), res2b (802,816  units), 
res3b (401,408  units), res3d (401,408  units), res4c (200,704  units), 
res4f (200,704  units), and res5c (100,352  units) were chosen as roughly  
corresponding  to the chosen layers in AlexNet  and VGG-16  in terms of 
network  depth. Subsequently,  we will refer to these layers as layers 1 to 
7. For each layer, we concatenated  all units of all feature maps into one 
long vector. This yielded  one activity  pattern  per stimulus  per layer. No 
dimensionality  reduction  was conducted  for any DNN layer. 
2.1.5. Constructing  classical  representational  similarity  matrices  
For the MEG and behavioral  data we used the RDMs as provided  by 
the original  studies and transformed  them into RSMs. For the MEG data, 
original  RDMs consisted  of pairwise  linear support  vector machine  clas- 
siﬁcation  accuracies,  where higher accuracies  are supposed  to reﬂect 
better linear separability  and thus greater dissimilarity  ( Cichy et al., 
2014 ; 2016 ). For the DNN and fMRI activity  patterns,  when constructing  
full RSMs, we computed  similarities  as the Pearson’s  correlation  coeﬃ-

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119637,"2.1. Public datasets  aggregated  in OpenBHB  
OpenBHB  aggregates  10 publicly  available  datasets,  namely  IXI 1 , 
ABIDE 1 2 , ABIDE 2 3 , CoRR Zuo et al. (2014) , GSP Buckner  et al. (2014) , 
LOCALIZER  Orfanos  et al. (2017) , MPI-Leipzig  Babayan  et al. (2019) , 
NAR Nastase  et al. (2021) , NPC Sunavsky  and Poppenk  (2020) , and RBP 
Follmer  et al. (2018) ; Li and Clariana  (2019) . Currently,  OpenBHB  is fo- 
cused only on Healthy  Controls  (HC) since the main challenge  consists  
in modeling  the (normal)  brain development  by building  a robust brain 
age predictor.  As a result, we only included  HC from ABIDE 1 and 2, 
and we left out the subjects  with Autism Spectrum  Disorders  in the cur- 
rent release.  OpenBHB  contains  𝑁 = 5330 3D T1 brain MRI scans from 
HC acquired  on 71 diﬀerent  acquisition  sites with eventually  multiple  
acquisition  protocols  per site (see Table 1 ). As highlighted  in the map 
accompanying  Table 1 , the subjects  included  in OpenBHB  come from 
European-American,  European,  and Asian genetic  backgrounds,  promot-  
ing more diversity  in OpenBHB.  To manage  redundant  images,  one ses- 
sion per participant  has been retained  along with its best-associated  run, 
selected  according  to image quality.  We also provide  the participants  
phenotype  as well as site and scanner  information  associated  with each 
image, which essentially  includes  age, sex, acquisition  site, diagnosis  
(in our case only HC), MRI scanner  magnetic  ﬁeld, and MRI scanner  set- 
tings identiﬁer  (a combination  of multiple  information  composed  of a 
subset of the repetition  time, echo time, sequence  name, ﬂip angle, and 
acquisition  coil). Some widespread  confounds  are also proposed,  such 
as the Total Intracranial  Volume  (TIV), the CerebroSpinal  Fluid Volume  
(CSFV),  the Gray Matter Volume  (GMV),  and the White Matter Volume  
(WMV).  
The overall age and sex distributions  for OpenBHB  are plotted Fig. 2 . 
It should be noticed  that sex distribution  is globally  well balanced  for 
all age bins. Age distribution  contains  2 main modes centered  around 
10 years old (during  synaptic  pruning)  and 25 years old with a long tail 
above 40 until 88 years (and fewer samples  in this range). 
Additionally,  we performed  appearance  analysis  from VBM data, as 
it preserves  cortical  and sub-cortical  information  from raw images (as 
opposed  to SBM) and ROI measures  can be derived  easily to reduce data 
dimensionnality.  Speciﬁcally,  we represented  the t-SNE visualization  of 
ROI extracted  from VBM data in Fig. 3 per study. This plot clearly sug- 
gests that age and site eﬀect are driving  the representation,  thus justify- 
ing the objective  of the OpenBHB  challenge.  Datasets  with both a large 
number  of sites and a large age range cover wider regions  in t-SNE space 
than others (e.g CoRR covers almost all regions  while GSP and IXI cover 
only middle and upper regions;  even if they are lifespan,  they only in- 
clude 6 sites together  vs 18 sites for CoRR). This is even more obvious  
with MPI-Leipzig  that covers mostly small left and upper regions  while 
it is also lifespan.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10664, 10669), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3217, 3223), match='\n2.2. '>"

4. Results  
The Results section is organised  as follows.  First, we verify that it 
would be theoretically  feasible  to calculate  the diameters  of the XNH- 
segmented  axons by analysing  how SNR and gradient  strength  inﬂuence  
the upper and lower bounds  of measurable  diameter.  We proceed  to ver- 
ify the multi-shell  SMT-2 and PL descriptions  for diﬀerent  numbers  of 
shells, and investigate  the eﬀects of both Rican and Gaussian  distributed  
noise on the diameter  estimates.  The SMT-2 and PL formulations  im- 
plement  diﬀerent  assumptions  and degrees  of a priori knowledge.  We 
therefore  evaluate  whether  the assumption  of a known parallel  diﬀusiv-  
ity is valid, using both low and high 𝑏 -values.  Then, we present  segmen-  
tations of axons from the splenium  and a crossing  ﬁber region of the 
monkey  brain. In these, we investigate  the ability of the SMT-2,  SMT-

We evaluated  our proposed  approach  on diﬀusion  magnetic  reso- 
nance imaging  (dMRI)  and resting-state  functional  MRI (rs-fMRI)  data 
provided  by the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) repository  ( Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ), and on the Microstructure-Informed  Connectomics  
(MICs) dataset ( Royer et al., 2021 ). 
All MRI data used in this study were publicly  available  and 
anonymized.  For HCP, we used data from the minimally  processed  S900 
release.  Participants  who did not complete  full imaging  data and who 
had family relationships  were excluded,  resulting  in a total of 326 par- 
ticipants  (mean ± SD age = 28.56 ± 3.73 years; 55% females).  Par- 
ticipant  recruitment  procedures  and informed  consent  forms, including  
consent  to share de-identiﬁed  data, were previously  approved  by the 
Washington  University  Institutional  Review  Board as part of the HCP. 
For MICs, the data consist of 50 healthy  volunteers  (29.82 ± 5.73 years; 
21 females)  scanned  between  April 2018 and September  2020. All par- 
ticipants  denied a history of neurological  illness. The MICs dataset was 
approved  by the Ethics Committee  of the Montreal  Neurological  Insti- 
tute and Hospital.  Written  informed  consent,  including  a statement  for 
openly sharing  all data in anonymized  form, was obtained  from all 
participants.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10224, 10229), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1385, 1391), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119054,"2.1. Participants  
We included  resting-state  MEG and T1-weighted  structural  MRI data 
from the BioFIND  dataset ( Vaghari  et al., 2021 ), which includes  individ-  
uals with Mild Cognitive  Impairment  (MCI) and Healthy  Elder Controls  
(HEC) from two sites: the MRC Cognition  & Brain Sciences  Unit (CBU) in 
Cambridge,  England,  and the center for Biomedical  Technology  (CTB) 
in Madrid,  Spain. The CBU controls  were recruited  from the CamCAN  
sample ( www.cam-can.org  ) who are screened  to be healthy,  i.e., have 
MMSE (and indeed ACE-R)  scores above conventional  cut-oﬀs,  as well 
as other screening  described  in CamCAN  paper ( Shafto et al., 2014 ). The 
CTB controls  had a full neuropsychological  assessment  to conﬁrm  nor- 
mal cognition,  and the same type of MRI assessment  as that done in the 
MCI group, i.e., a radiologist  reported  MRIs as normal.  
In general,  the MCI diagnosis  was determined  with the intermediate  
probability  according  to the National  Institute  on Aging–Alzheimer  As- 
sociation  criteria  ( Albert et al., 2011 ), i.e., given by a clinician  based 
on clinical  and cognitive  tests, self- and informant-report,  and in the ab- 
sence of full dementia  or obvious  other causes (e.g., psychiatric).  More 
speciﬁcally,  for the CBU data, individuals  were diagnosed  with MCI af- 
ter referral  for symptoms,  mainly memory  problems  (i.e., they were not 
derived  by screening  of cognitively  asymptomatic  people).  The diagno-  
sis was made in a regional  memory  clinic, including  ACE/ACER  and 
MMSE tests as standard,  with a signiﬁcant  deﬁcit in memory  domain  
tests. PET and ﬂuidic Biomarkers  were not used as standard,  although  
all had structural  brain imaging  (usually  MRI in the clinic unless con- 
traindicated,  when a CT is occasionally  used) and clinical  follow-up  in 
support  of the diagnosis.  By deﬁnition  of MCI, suﬀerers  had functional  
independence  at the time of diagnosis.  sMRI was used to exclude  other 
pathologies  and to identify  features  consistent  with MCI/AD  pathology  
(e.g. MTL atrophy  without  mass lesion, high vascular  burden).  
For the CTB data, the diagnosis  of MCI was based on criteria  from 
Frisoni et al. (2011 ). It was based on a mixture  of clinical  and quantita-  
tive approaches,  but MMSE score was not the sole criterion.  The diag- 
nosis required  an impairment  in the memory  domain  and/or other cog- 
nitive functions,  but a ""memory  complaint""  was not required,  so some 
participants  showed  awareness  of their cognitive  problems  and others 
did not. Indeed,  for CTB data participants  were not aware of their cur- 
rent cognitive  status. Therefore,  they did not have to show cognitive  
complaints,  but memory/cognitive  failures  were reported  by close com- 
panions.  The only biomarkers  used systematically  were brain morphol-  
ogy (from MRI) and APOE. As a requirement  for the diagnosis  criteria,  
MCI cases were able to still perform  their daily living activities.  MRI 
(T1, T2 and/or FLAIR) was used to rule out a vascular  disorder,  and any 
other type of neurological  disease  (i.e., tumor, stroke, infection)  that 
could better explain  the cognitive  symptoms.  
After excluding  15 cases without  an MRI, and 2 with MRIs with den- 
tal artifacts,  there were 163 HEC and 144 MCI datasets.  A summary  of 
sample characteristics  is reported  in Table 1 , which includes  variables  
that could aﬀect MCI status (such as education)  or could aﬀect brain 
activity  in general  (such as time of day of testing)  or could aﬀect the 
MEG data speciﬁcally  (such as head motion or distance  from sensors).  A 
small number  of missing  values were imputed  using the mean from non- 
missing  values for each variable:  5 missing  values for MMSE (1.5% of 
cases, all MCI), 12 missing  values for Education  (3.7% of cases; 11 MCI, 1 
HEC) and 26 missing  values for mean and standard  deviation  of motion 
(8.0% of cases; 21 MCI and 5 HEC). We used MATLAB’s  “knnimpute  ”, 
applied  across the whole sample,  which uses the value from the nearest

The LIFE Adult study ( Loeﬄer  et al., 2015 ), a population-based  co- 
hort study, encompasses  dense clinical  screenings  of more than 10,000 
participants  coming  from the area of Leipzig,  Germany.  Among  oth- 
ers, the screening  included  measures  of height, weight,  blood pressure,  
blood-based  biomarkers,  cognitive  performance  and questionnaire  bat- 
teries on mental health, and lifestyle  (for more details see: Loeﬄer  et al., 
2015 ). 
2.1.1. Study sample and exclusion  criteria 
Of the more than 10,000 subjects  of the LIFE Adult study, 2637 par- 
ticipants  underwent  a 1-hour MRI recording  session at baseline.  Of those 
participants  with MR-scans,  621 participants  were excluded  mainly due 
to pathologies,  leaving  2016 subjects  for further analysis  (age range 
18–82 years, mean age = 57.32, median  age = 63.0; n female = 946; see 
Fig. 2 and Fig. A3 in Appendix  D ). Partially  overlapping  exclusion  cri- 
teria were previous  strokes ( n = 54), excessive  brain lesions rated by 
trained  medical  staﬀ ( n = 114), including  white matter (WM) lesions 
rated with a Fazekas  ( Fazekas  et al., 1987 ) score of 3 ( n = 44), radio- 
logical diagnosis  of brain tumour  ( n = 22), diagnosis  of multiple  scle- 
rosis ( n = 5), epilepsy  ( n = 27), cancer treatment  in the last 12 months  
( n = 109), centrally  active medication  ( n = 275), cognitive  impairments  indicated  by a MMSE score < 26 ( n = 80), and poor quality MRIs (failing  
a visually  quality check, e.g., regarding  motion artefacts,  n = 41). 
2.1.2. MRI data 
MRI data was acquired  in a 1-hour recording  session using a 32- 
channel  head coil in a 3T Siemens  Verio scanner.  Various  MRI sequences  
were applied  (see Loeﬄer  et al., 2015 ). For this study, we trained  
models on three MRI sequences  used in clinical  settings:  i) structural  
T1-weighted  images were taken with an MP-RAGE  sequence  (1 mm 
isotropic  voxels, 176 slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, 
ﬁeld of view 256 ×240 ×176 mm 3 , sagittal  orientation)  which is often 
used to quantify  cerebrospinal  ﬂuid, white and grey matter among oth- 
ers. ii) Fluid-attenuated  inversion  recovery  images (FLAIR)  were ac- 
quired (1 mm isotropic  voxels, 192 slices, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 395 ms, 
TI = 1800 ms, ﬁeld of view 250 ×250 ×192 mm 3 , sagittal  orientation).  
FLAIR is highly sensitive  towards  lesions in the WM, which are known 
to accumulate  with age ( Tang et al., 1997 ; Ge et al., 2002 ; Beck et al., 
2021 ). Lastly, iii) susceptibility-weighted  magnitude  images (SWI) are 
used to detect iron-deposits  in the basal-ganglia  ( Pfeﬀerbaum  et al., 
2009 ; Bekiesinska-Figatowska  et al., 2013 ), which could be linked to 
neurodegeneration  and cognitive  decline  ( Haller et al., 2010 ; Du et al., 
2018 ; Thomas  et al., 2020 ), and are used to discover  brain haem- 
orrhages.  SWIs were recorded  with a T2 ∗ -weighted  pulse sequence  
(0.8 ×0.7 ×2.0 mm non-isotropic  voxels, 64 slices, TR = 28 ms, 
TE = 20 ms, ﬁeld of view 230 ×173 ×128 mm 3 , sagittal  orientation).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(8322, 8327), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3131, 3137), match='\n2.2. '>"

Fifty-six  healthy  volunteers  (38 female,  18 male) participated  in the 
electroencephalography  (EEG) experiment.  We did not perform  a sam- 
ple size calculation  a priori because  power estimates  based on previous  
studies were deemed  too unreliable.  Furthermore,  explorative  analyses  
were based on a post-hoc  split of an unknown  distribution  of ratings 
across levels of perceptual  awareness.  Thus, we made a conservative  es- 
timate of our statistical  power and aimed at recording  50 participants,  
i.e., about two to three times the sample size of comparable  studies 
( Koivisto  and Revonsuo,  2008 ; Luo et al., 2010 ). Six additional  sub- 
jects were recorded  to compensate  for technical  problems  (see below).  
All participants  were right-handed,  had normal  or corrected-to-normal  
vision, and had no history of neurological,  cardiovascular,  and psychi- 
atric diseases  or structural  brain anomalies.  Participants  were excluded  
when the T1 criteria  ( > 70% correct identiﬁcation  over all runs) or the 
T2 criteria  (correct  detection  of T2 in 50% + / - 25% of all trials per run) 
were violated.  No participant  violated  the T1 criterion,  but three partic-

ipants violated  the T2 criterion.  Six subjects  had to be excluded  due to 
technical  problems  during EEG data recording.  Four participants  had to 
be excluded  due to an insuﬃcient  number  of trials after removing  arti- 
facts (i.e., less than 5 trials in at least one experimental  condition).  Each 
ERP consisted  on average  of 62.68 ( SD = 18.66 ) trials. The remaining  44 
subjects  (31 females:  M = 22.75 years, SD = 3.71 years) were included  
in the statistical  analysis.  The local ethics committee  of the University  
of Münster  approved  the study. All subjects  provided  written  informed

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119701,"1. Introduction  
Many neuroimaging  studies using MRI frequently  leverage  multiple  
imaging  protocols  with varying  complementary  contrasts.  This can en- 
able the extraction  of more functional  or structural  information  at any 
given anatomical  location  than what can be achieved  with any single 
modality  alone, which is a key advantage  of MRI over other noninva-  
sive imaging  technologies.  To achieve  this, accurate  alignment  of these 
MRI data across the diﬀerent  contrasts  acquired  is critical.  Head motion 
often occurs between  scans, and rigid registration  can be employed  to 
align the datasets  —by utilizing  various  available  methods  that can ac- 
count for the diﬀerent  image contrasts  —however  this alignment  is far 
more challenging  in the presence  of diﬀerential  geometric  distortion  be- 
tween these acquisitions.  In many cases, these geometric  distortions  also 
can change with head position,  further exacerbating  error in alignment.  
The most prevalent  source of geometric  distortion  in MRI is inhomo-  
geneity  of the main magnetic  ﬁeld, B 0 , which for modern  MRI scanners  
is predominantly  induced  by magnetic  susceptibility  diﬀerences  within 
the volunteer’s  head mainly found in regions  near to air-tissue  interfaces  
(e.g. at the sinuses,  ear canals, and oral cavity).  These local magnetic  
ﬁeld variations  cause ﬁeld gradients  that interfere  with the image en- 
coding gradients  and thereby  result in errors in image encoding  such as 
voxel shift errors, which manifest  as nonrigid  geometric  distortion  (i.e.,

B 0 ﬁeld oﬀset, these image encoding  errors scale with image encoding  
bandwidth,  such that a lower encoding  bandwidth  results in a greater 
vulnerability  to distortion  and a larger voxel shift in the presence  of ﬁeld 
inhomogeneity.  
Single-shot  Echo Planar Imaging  (EPI) is widely used for acquir- 
ing various  MRI contrasts  such as functional,  diﬀusion  and perfusion  
weighted  imaging,  and increasingly  for anatomical  imaging  as well. EPI 
is well known to be vulnerable  to these geometric  distortions,  which are 
primarily  along the phase-encoding  direction;  in EPI, not only is this 
the encoding  direction  with the lowest bandwidth,  but also in most ap- 
plications  of EPI the phase-encoding  bandwidth  is suﬃciently  low that 
distortions  are clearly apparent,  with maximum  voxel displacements  in 
the centimeter  range. Phase encoding  in EPI has relatively  low encod- 
ing bandwidth  (such as 30 Hz/pixel)  compared  to the relatively  high 
frequency-encoding  bandwidths  typically  used in conventional  (non- 
EPI) acquisitions  (such as 600 Hz/pixel),  thus geometric  distortion  is 
most often considered  to be only in the phase-encoding  direction  in EPI, 
and for most non-EPI  applications  distortion  in the frequency-encoding  
direction  is negligible  ( Jezzard,  2012 ). While the distortion  in the phase- 
encoding  direction  in EPI can be partly mitigated  with parallel  imag- 
ing acceleration  ( de Zwart et al., 2002 ; Griswold  et al., 1999 ), which 
increases  the eﬀective  phase-encoding  bandwidth,  the undersampling

Results  
Children  show limbic community  expansion  and greater integration  of 
somatomotor  and language  communities  
We ﬁrst examined  how cortical  patterns  of functional  communities  
diﬀered  in middle childhood  from patterns  previously  found in adults. 
We used a well-established  community  detection  algorithm,  applied  to 
adults in Yeo et al. (2011) , to create a group-level  developmental  parti- 
tion from vertex connectivity  proﬁles  ( Fig. 1 ). We investigated  the sta- 
bility of community  partitions  across diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  
with a resampling  approach  to determine  whether  k = 7 was a reasonable  
choice. Local minima  in instability  indicate  the number  of communities  
that can stably estimated  using the clustering  algorithm;  we observe  
a marked  increase  in instability  after 𝑘 = 7 ( Fig. 1 b). Though  our pri- 
mary goal was ease of comparison  to the adult 7-community  partition  
in Yeo et al. (2011) , our ﬁndings  of a local minimum  at k = 7, as was 
found in an adult sample ( Yeo et al., 2011 ), suggests  that 7 communi-  
ties is an appropriate  starting  point for partitioning  cortex in children.  
The resulting  child clustering  partition  with 7 communities  is shown 
in Fig. 2 b. In Fig. 2 c, we show the allocation  of cortex to communi-  
ties in the clustering  partition  and a comparison  to the adult partition.  
In the clustering  partition,  more total surface area was assigned  to the 
limbic and visual communities  than in the adult partition,  and less to 
the default and frontoparietal  communities  than in the adult partition.  
This observation  is suggestive  of a relative  expansion  of limbic and vi- 
sual territory,  and contraction  of default and frontoparietal  territory,  in 
children  relative  to adults. 
To further probe the diﬀerences  between  the contours  of children’s  
functional  communities  and those of adults, we investigated  measures  
of partition  similarity  and the speciﬁc  brain regions  that showed  dif- 
ferences  in community  assignment.  The clustering  partition  is signiﬁ- 
cantly more similar to the adult partition  than expected  by chance:  the 
normalized  mutual information  of the two partitions  is 0 . 64 ( p < 0.001, 
permutation  test), and the normalized  information  distance  ( Vinh et al., 
2010 ) is 0.36 ( p < 0.001, permutation  test). Further,  39 . 53 % of vertices  
(ignoring  the medial wall) have a diﬀerent  assignment  in the clustering  
partition  than in the adult partition.  Of these vertices,  the majority  of 
switches  were in assignment  of (i) adult default system regions  to the 
limbic community  in children  ( 29 . 63 %), and of (ii) adult somatomotor  
regions  to the ventral attention  community  in children  ( 23 . 8 %) ( Fig. 2 d). 
9 . 46 % of switches  were from the frontoparietal  to the default commu-  
nity, and 8 . 63 % were from the ventral attention  to the frontoparietal  
community.  The ventral regions  of the precentral  (primary  motor cor- 
tex) and postcentral  gyri (primary  somatosensory  cortex),  regions  that 
typically  encode the face ( Weiss et al., 2013 ), are clustered  with the ven- tral attention  community,  a fractionation  that was previously  observed  
in the 17-community  partition  in adults in Yeo et al. (2011) . 
Uncertainty  in community  assignment  is high in transmodal  regions 
When connectivity  is distributed  evenly in a similar pattern  across 
communities,  the assignment  of regions  to communities  will be uncer- 
tain, whereas  when connectivity  is clearly segregated  into diﬀerenti-  
ated patterns,  the assignment  of regions  to communities  will be cer- 
tain. Here we sought to understand  where connectivity  may not yet be 
clearly segregated  in the child brain, and we therefore  calculated  the 
certainty  in the assignment  of regions  to communities.  We employed  
the conﬁdence  measure  used in Yeo et al. (2011) to index certainty  in 
community  assignment  across vertices  (see Methods);  higher values of 
conﬁdence  are indicative  of higher certainty  in community  assignment.  
In the adult sample examined  by Yeo et al. (2011) , areas of low con- 
ﬁdence  fall primarily  along borders  between  communities,  and some- 
times indicate  where communities  could be fractionated  in a higher-  
resolution  partition  ( Fig. 2 a). Similarly,  areas of low conﬁdence  also 
fall along boundaries  between  communities  in the clustering  partition  
( Fig. 2 b), but there are additional  regions  in the clustering  partition  
that show low conﬁdence  in assignment  in the posterior  cingulate,  pre- 
cuneus,  and inferior  parietal  lobule (circled  in Fig. 3 a and 3 b). Despite  
lower conﬁdence,  the precuneus  and posterior  cingulate  area maintain  
similar community  assignment  across both the adult partition  and the 
two developmental  partitions  ( Fig. 2 b and 4 a-c), varying  only in their 
spatial extent. Similarly  to adults, areas of low conﬁdence  in children  
seem to primarily  indicate  fuzzy delineations  between  communities,  but 
it is diﬃcult  to ascertain  visually  whether  the certainty  along boundaries  
of higher-order  communities  is lower than the certainty  along bound- 
aries of primary  sensory  areas. For that, we turn to an investigation  at 
the level of functional  systems.  
We asked whether  fuzzy delineations  of boundaries  are distributed  
broadly  across association  cortex in both childhood  and adulthood,  or 
whether  children  show areas of undiﬀerentiated  connectivity  primar-  
ily within the limbic and somatomotor  systems  that are assigned  dif- 
ferently  than in adults. We quantiﬁed  this by calculating  the median  
conﬁdence  within each community  in both the adult and child samples  
( Fig. 3 c,d). In the adult sample examined  in Yeo et al. (2011) , conﬁ- 
dence was highest  in vertices  assigned  to the visual and somatomotor  
systems  and slightly  lower in vertices  assigned  to higher-order  associa-  
tion systems  ( Fig. 3 c, 𝐻(6) = 21179 . 38 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ). In particular,  there 
was lowest conﬁdence  in assignment  in regions  in the frontoparietal  
(all pairwise  comparisons  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected)  and dorsal at- 
tention  systems  (all pairwise  comparisons  signiﬁcant  except ventral at- 
tention,  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected).  In our developmental  sample,  
conﬁdence  was again highest  in vertices  assigned  to the visual commu-  
nity, with signiﬁcantly  lower conﬁdence  in vertices  assigned  to other 
communities  ( Fig. 3 d, 𝐻(6) = 25933 . 24 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ). There was lowest 
conﬁdence  in assignment  in regions  assigned  to higher-order  association  
communities,  in particular,  the dorsal attention  (all pairwise  compar-  
isons 𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  default (all pairwise  comparisons  
signiﬁcant  except dorsal attention  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  and 
frontoparietal  systems  (all pairwise  comparisons  signiﬁcant,  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , 
Bonferroni  corrected).  These results are robust to using the community  
assignments  from the adult clustering  partition  instead  of the child clus- 
tering partition  (see Figure S1a, 𝐻(6) = 28310 . 69 , 𝑝 < 2 ×10 −16 ), ﬁnd- 
ing again that conﬁdence  was highest  in vertices  assigned  to the vi- 
sual system,  and lowest in frontoparietal  (all pairwise  comparisons  
𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  dorsal attention  (all pairwise  compar-  
isons 𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected),  and default (all pairwise  compar-  
isons except ventral attention  𝑝 < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni  corrected).  Note that 
values of conﬁdence  in the developmental  sample are overall lower than 
those of the adult sample used in Yeo et al. (2011) , though we do not 
conduct  statistical  tests comparing  the two, as this diﬀerence  could be 
due to other discrepancies  between  the adult data and the developmen-

Fig. 1. Overview  of methods.  The adult partition  of cortical regions into 7 communities  ( Yeo et al., 2011 ) (inset) was compared  to two developmental  partitions:  one 
generated  using a data-driven  clustering  approach  and one generated  using a model-based  WSBM approach.  a. The data-driven  clustering  approach  was developed  
by Yeo et al. Yeo et al. (2011) and attempts  to cluster areas into communities  based on their patterns  of connectivity  to the rest of the brain. b. Schematic  of 
pipeline  for generating  the data-driven  clustering  partition.  Vertex-wise  surface data was extracted  and correlation  proﬁles across 1175 equally-spaced  regions of 
interest (ROIs) were calculated  for each vertex (average  correlation  proﬁles depicted).  These proﬁles were then used as input to the clustering  algorithm,  which 
attempts  to cluster vertices into 𝑘 = 7 communities.  c. We investigated  the stability  of diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ) using a resampling  approach  combined  
with the clustering  algorithm  (see Methods  ). With an increasing  number of estimated  communities,  we observe less stability,  which is expected  as the number of 
estimated  communities  enlarges  the solution  space of the clustering  problem.  Local minima indicate  the number of communities  that can be stably estimated  using 
the clustering  algorithm;  we observe a marked increase  in instability  after 𝑘 = 7 (black line). d, The generative  WSBM approach  models interactions  both within and 
between  communities,  attempting  to partition  communities  such that nodes with similar patterns  of connectivity  are grouped  together.  e. Schematic  of pipeline  for 
generating  the WSBM partition.  Due to the computational  limits of the WSBM algorithm,  we took a common  dimensionality-reduction  step, and used a 400-region  
parcellation  ( Schaefer  et al., 2018 ) to downsample  the data and extract regional  timeseries.  Correlations  between  regional  timeseries  were represented  as a network;  
here we depict the average correlation  matrix. These networks  were then used as input to the WSBM, which attempts  to group parcels into 𝑘 = 7 communities.  f. 
To investigate  the goodness-of-ﬁt  (log-likelihood)  of diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ) using the WSBM, we ﬁt the WSBM to our main dataset and evaluated  the 
goodness-of-ﬁt  in both the main (black) and replication  (purple)  datasets  (left panel). We ﬁnd a noted decrease  in goodness-of-ﬁt  in the replication  dataset around 
𝑘 = 5 − 6 , as generalizability  decreases.  We observed  that although  the choice of 𝑘 constrains  the number of communities  detected  at the subject level, the number of 
communities  detected  at the group consensus  level can vary from the 𝑘 set at the subject level; we observed  a distinct plateau in the number of communities  detected  
at the group level at 𝑘 = 7 (right panel). (For interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
tal data used here. Our results suggest  that in the child brain, connectiv-  
ity in higher-order  association  regions,  particularly  the dorsal attention,  
default,  and frontoparietal  communities,  is not yet clearly segregated.  
We wondered  whether  areas of undiﬀerentiated  connectivity  in chil- 
dren were similar or diﬀerent  to those found in adults. We began by com- 
paring the spatial distributions  of conﬁdence  in the adult and child sam- 
ples. Summing  the conﬁdence  maps, we found that areas of low conﬁ- 
dence are predominantly  in higher-order  association  cortex in both chil- 
dren and adults ( Fig. 3 e). Visual cortex and the somatomotor  strip show 
relatively  high conﬁdence  in both samples.  Examining  the diﬀerences  in 
conﬁdence  between  adult and child samples,  we found that overall,  chil- 
dren show lower conﬁdence  in community  assignment  ( Fig. 3 f). We did 
not strongly  interpret  this diﬀerence  because  it could arise from several 
distinct  diﬀerences  between  the adult data used by Yeo et al. (2011) and the child data used here. Note that visual areas show no diﬀerences  in 
conﬁdence  between  adult and child samples,  as they are relatively  high 
conﬁdence  in both adults and children.  Overall,  these results above sug- 
gest that children’s  cortical  patterns  of connectivity  may be less diﬀer- 
entiated  than those of the adult brain. 
When examining  the distribution  of certainty  across communities,  
we found that the dorsal attention  community  in particular  had some 
regions  with very low values of conﬁdence.  Investigating  these values, 
we found that these regions  were located  along the border between  the 
visual and dorsal attention  communities  (see Supplemental  Figure S2). 
Some of these areas are assigned  to the visual community  in the adult 
clustering  partition  (see negative  values in the visual community  in Sup- 
plemental  Figure S1). We observe  the assignment  of a coherent  region 
in the superior  parietal  lobule, adjacent  to the intraparietal  sulcus, to

the visual community  in the child clustering  partition.  In the adult par- 
tition, a smaller  region in this area is assigned  to the visual system.  This 
is also consistent  with the increased  surface area allocated  to the visual 
community  in the child clustering  partition,  compared  to in the adult 
partition  (see Fig. 2 c), suggesting  that these areas may be more tightly 
linked to extrastriate  cortex (area MT and anterior  MT) in childhood  
than in adulthood.  
Data ‐driven community  assignments  are highly stable across samples  
If children’s  patterns  of brain connectivity  are simply more diﬀer- 
ent from each other (i.e., higher interindividual  variability)  than adult’s 
patterns  of brain connectivity  are, then partitions  derived  from develop-  
mental data might be less stable across samples.  Therefore,  we employed  
a replication  dataset of children  from the Adolescent  Brain and Cogni- 
tive Development  (ABCD)  study to assess the reliability  and generaliz-  
ability of our ﬁndings.  Identical  preprocessing  and clustering  algorithm  
implementations  were used on the replication  dataset,  drawn from two 
ABCD sites. Community  assignments  in the replication  clustering  parti- 
tion are highly consistent  with those generated  using the original  dataset 
(see Figure S4a and S4b). A total of 94 . 99 % vertices  are assigned  to the 
same community  across both datasets,  with 94.76%  of vertices  in the 
right hemisphere  and 95.21%  of vertices  in the left hemisphere  being 
assigned  to the same community.  Normalized  mutual information  (NMI) 
of the two partitions  is 0 . 88 , and normalized  information  distance  is 0 . 12 . 
These results suggest  that the cortical  patterning  of functional  commu-  
nities in middle childhood  is stable, and reliably  shows diﬀerences  from 
adult community  organization.  Children  show less-solidiﬁed  higher ‐order community  interactions  in 
association  cortex 
Using the data-driven  approach,  we observed  that there were stable 
and reliable  patterns  of cortical  community  structure  in middle child- 
hood that diﬀer from those established  in adults. Notably,  we found con- 
siderable  reapportionment  of adult default system regions  to the limbic 
community,  as well somatomotor  regions  to the ventral attention  com- 
munity.  This raises the question  of the origins of these assignments–
is it due to changes  in connectivity  between  these speciﬁc  systems,  or 
broader  diﬀerences  in patterns  of connectivity  across all other functional  
communities?  To address  this question,  we turned to another  commu-  
nity detection  approach,  a generative  model-based  approach  called the 
weighted  stochastic  block model (WSBM),  that diﬀers from the data- 
driven approach  in several important  ways. For one, it explicitly  models 
the interactions  between  communities.  While the data-driven  approach  
models patterns  of connectivity  and attempts  to group regions  with sim- 
ilar patterns  together  into a community,  the model-based  approach  par- 
titions cortex by maximizing  the likelihood  that each ”block ”of connec-  
tions between  two communities  is internally  similar and coherent.  Addi- 
tionally,  using WSBM allows us to assess not just the reliability  of these 
cortical  patterns  of communities  across approaches,  but also employ  a 
more biologically-motivated  method  with fewer motivating  principles.  
We ﬁrst examined  whether  cortical  patterns  of communities  esti- 
mated using the model-based  approach  resemble  those found in adults 
or those found using the data-driven  approach  in children.  We used the 
WSBM to create a group-level  developmental  partition  from average  par- 
cel connectivity  patterns  ( Figure 1 ). To determine  whether  7 communi-  
ties was a reasonable  choice when using the model-based  approach,  we 
ﬁrst systematically  investigated  the goodness-of-ﬁt  of the WSBM across 
diﬀerent  numbers  of communities  ( 𝑘 ). When ﬁtting the WSBM to our 
main dataset,  we observe  the goodness-of-ﬁt  steadily  increases  with in-

We selected  high-resolution  infant rs-fMRI  data (number  of sub-

± 186 days) acquired  using 3T Siemens  Prisma MRI scanners  with

tion = 2 ×2 ×2 𝑚𝑚 ) from the BCP ( Howell  et al., 2019 ). The parents  of all 
participants  provided  permission  and informed  consent  prior to partici-  
pation, and all procedures  were approved  by the University  of North Car- 
olina at Chapel Hill and the University  of Minnesota  Institutional  Review  
Boards (IRB). We performed  head motion and geometric  distortion  cor- 
rection,  functional-anatomical  image alignment,  and one-time  resam- 
pling ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) of rs-fMRI  data using FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ). Considering  that aggressive  deformation  could cause signal dis- 
tortions,  these processes  were completed  in a native space to better ac- 
commodate  the much smaller  brain sizes of the infants at diﬀerent  ages compared  to those of adults. It also avoided  the diﬃculty  of smoothing  
kernel selection,  reduced  the partial volume  eﬀect, and made surface 
analysis  easier. We extracted  150 IC spatial maps and IC time series 
pairs from each sample of infant rs-fMRI  data (a total of 3,305 signal

culated  the inter-rater  agreement  among each pair of raters using the 
other 20 samples  (scans) of rs-fMRI  data. We excluded  three raters 
who showed  low agreement  ( < 90%) with others, and the rest labeled

Whole-brain  dynamics  are modeled  as the mean-ﬁeld  activity  of 
neuronal  populations  in each brain region. We use a Wilson-Cowan  type model ( Wilson and Cowan,  1972, 1973 ), which is also an adapted  
version  of the Wong-Wang  model ( Deco et al., 2014 ; Wong and 
Wang, 2006 ) with a sigmoidal  transfer  function  (equation  S11). The 
adaptation  improves  the biological  plausibility  and multistability  upon 
the reduced  Wong-Wang  model. Here, we brieﬂy introduce  the model; 
an extensive  analysis  of the numeric  and mathematical  properties  of the 
model is provided  in the Supplementary  Materials  (Section  S4 for nu- 
meric results,  Section  S8-S9 - for analytical  results).  Each model region 
contains  a pair of excitatory  (E) and inhibitory  (I) populations,  whose 
activity  is described  by the local model Fig. 1 a, left box; equation  1 - (3) in 
terms of the state variables  𝑆 𝐸 and 𝑆 𝐼 . Physically,  𝑆 𝐸 and 𝑆 𝐼 are inter- 
preted as the fraction  of open synaptic  channels  in their respective  pop- 
ulations,  i.e. the gating variables.  Through  local connections  ( 𝑤 ’s), the 
excitatory  population  excites itself with strength  𝑤 𝐸𝐸 and the inhibitory  
population  with strength  𝑤 𝐸𝐼 , while the inhibitory  population  inhibits  
itself with strength  𝑤 𝐼𝐼 and the excitatory  population  with strength  𝑤 𝐼𝐸 . 
Local models further connect  to each other through  a global network  
Fig. 1 a, dashed lines), giving rise to the global model (right; equation  4 - 
(6) . For the global model, nodes of the large-scale  network  correspond  
to anatomical  regions  in the human brain based on a 66-region  parcel- 
lation used in Deco et al. (2013b)  and Hagmann  et al. (2008) ( Fig. 1 b). 
Edge weights  of the network  reﬂect the strength  of long-range  struc- 
tural connectivity  between  the brain regions  ( 𝐶 𝑖𝑗 in equation  6 ), either 
estimated  using structural  data from the Human  Connectome  Project 
( Civier et al., 2019 ; Van Essen et al., 2013 ) ( Section  4.5.1 ) or artiﬁ- 
cially constructed  for comparison.  The overall strength  of long-range  
connections  in the model brain is scaled by a global coupling  param- 
eter 𝐺( equation  6 ), which denotes  the overall level of inter-regional  
interaction  across the whole-brain.  In similar modeling  approaches,  𝐺
is typically  treated as a free parameter  to be ﬁtted to the empirical  
fMRI data (e.g., Deco and Jirsa (2012) ; Deco et al. (2014, 2013b)  ; 
Demirta  et al. (2019) ). It was thought  to be an indicator  of the level of 
arousal  or wakefulness  ( Jobst et al., 2017 ). In the present  work, we ﬁrst 
examine  theoretically  how parameter  𝐺inﬂuences  the dynamic  land- 
scape of the model ( Fig. 4 ) and then ﬁt it to individual  subjects’  fMRI 
data. 
In the present  work, the local and global models are used in two 
ways: (1) to compute  the repertoire  of attractors  using zero-ﬁnding  algo- 
rithms (see Section  4.2 for details)  and (2) to be numerically  integrated  
to generate  simulated  brain dynamics.  The former is used to character-  
ize the overall organization  of the model dynamic  landscape.  The latter 
is used to characterize  local explorations  of the dynamic  landscape.  Both 
aspects  are compared  to the human data to demonstrate  the empirically  
relevant  features.  Below, we ﬁrst illustrate  the concept  of a dynamic  
landscape  and cross-attractor  coordination  using a toy example,  which 
is followed  by more realistic  models to examine  how structural  proper-  
ties across scales aﬀect the dynamic  landscape.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10744, 10749), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3636, 3642), match='\n2.2. '>"

4. Results  
4.1. Arousal  ratings 
A mixed eﬀects model was used to analyse  the arousal  ratings,  
with ﬁxed eﬀects session (0 h, 3 h, 12 h and 1 week), cueing (cued 
and non-cued)  and emotion  (negative  and neutral),  and with the sub- 
jects as the random  eﬀect (see Fig. 2 ). There was no cueing eﬀect 
(F (0.8, 30.84) = 1.068; p = 0.293),  and no interactions:  session x cueing 
(F (2.7, 100.9) = 0.845; p = 0.461),  session x emotion  (F (3, 114) = 1.018; p = 0.388),  cueing x emotion  (F (1, 38) = 0.305; p = 0.584) and ses- 
sion x cueing x emotion  (F (3, 114) = 0.176; p = 0.913).  The results 
showed  eﬀects of session (F (3, 114) = 2.824; p = 0.042) and emotion  
(F (1, 38) = 131.6; p < 0.0001).  Post-hoc  tests revealed  a signiﬁcant  de- 
crease in arousal  across the learning  period ( t = 3.720; p FDR = 0.002;),  
i.e. from session 1 (0 h; mean = 4.889) to session 2 (3 h; mean = 4.592).  
There was a trend towards  a signiﬁcant  increase  in arousal  overnight  
(3 h; mean = 4.592; 12 h; mean = 4.710; t = 1.951; p FDR = 0.08) and 
from session 2 (3 h mean = 4.592) to session 4 (1 week; mean = 4.754; 
t = 1.894; p FDR = 0.081,).  
4.2. Functional  imaging  of the arousal rating task 
We used a repeated  measures  ANOVA  with factors cueing (cued 
and non-cued)  and emotion  (negative  and neutral)  to examine  the neu- 
roimaging  data in our ROIs (amygdala,  hippocampus,  parahippocam-  
pus, insula and OFC). This showed  a main eﬀect of emotion  in the amyg- 
dala and OFC ( Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). In the amygdala,  negative  items 
elicited  greater activation  than neutral  items, while in the OFC, the op- 
posite was true. 
We also found a cueing x emotion  interaction  in the OFC ( Table 2 
and Fig. 4 ). 
To further investigate  this interaction,  we created  a masque  using 
only the signiﬁcant  clusters  listed in Table 2 and ran a simple main 
eﬀect analysis  of cueing for the neutral  and negative  items. Signiﬁcant  
clusters  are listed in Table 3 and depicted  in Fig. 4 . 
Parameter  estimates  from the peak clusters  on each side of the OFC 
were plotted for the two valence  categories  in both the cued and non- 
cued conditions  ( Fig. 4 ). Note that responses  for negative  items were 
plotted in red-orange,  while responses  for neutral  items were plotted 
in blue-green,  and parameter  estimates  are shown on the right. Inter- 
estingly,  cueing decreased  activity  in the OFC in response  to negative  
items and increased  it in response  to neutral  items. 
Next, we investigated  whether  cueing eﬀects were modulated  by the 
duration  of SWS or REM, as shown in other studies ( Cairney  et al., 
2014 ; Tamminen  et al., 2017 ). To this end, we added the amount  of 
time spent in each sleep stage as a covariate  and re-ran the second-  
level analysis.  This revealed  a signiﬁcant  interaction  between  cueing

Subjects  recruited  from Stanford  University  participated  in one of 
two studies.  The ﬁrst study included  twelve participants  (5 female,  ages 
23–44) whose data was previously  published  in ( Bugatus  et al., 2017 ). 
These participants  underwent  fMRI scanning  including  three runs of the 
Selective  Attention  task and three runs of the Oddball  task. The sec- 
ond study included  20 additional  participants  (10 female,  ages 18–37) 
from ( Keller et al., 2021 ) who participated  in one run of the Selective  
Attention  task and one run of the Oddball  task as well as other tasks 
not relevant  to this study. Because  of time constraints,  they participated  
in fewer runs of the Selective  Attention  and Oddball  tasks. Seven sub- 
jects were excluded  because  of excessive  head movement  ( > 2 voxels 
either within-scan  or between-scans)  during one or more tasks and 4 
subjects  were excluded  because  we could not localize  the majority  of 
VTC functional  ROIs of suﬃcient  size. Thus, a total sample of twenty-  
one subjects  (8 female,  ages 21–44) were included  in our analyses.  All

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118809,"2.1. The math of GED 
The goal of GED is to ﬁnd a set of channel  weights  that multiply  the 
channel  time series, such that the weighted  sum of channels  maximizes  
a contrast  between  two data features.  For example,  consider  that the to- 
be-maximized  feature is a post-stimulus  time window,  and that the pre- 
stimulus  time window  is the reference  period. If the post-stimulus  data 
are contained  in a channels-by-time  matrix 𝐗 𝑆 , the pre-stimulus  data 
are contained  in a channels-by-time  matrix 𝐗 𝑅 , and the set of weights  
are contained  in column  vector 𝐰 , then the goal of GED can be expressed  
as: 
𝜆= ‖𝐰 T 𝐗 𝑆 ‖2 
‖𝐰 T 𝐗 𝑅 ‖2 (1) 
‖⋅‖2 indicates  the squared  magnitude  of the vector (the sum of its 
squared  elements).  Thus, 𝜆is the ratio of the magnitude  of the “sig- 
nal ”d a t a ﬁltered  through  𝐰 , to the magnitude  of the “reference  ”d a t a 
ﬁltered  through  the same 𝐰 . The squared  magnitude  of a vector can be

same data. (C) A PCA on these data removes  the correlation  between  variables,  but does not separate  the sources.  The PC basis vectors, which form the axes PC 1 and 
PC 2 , are shown in the channel space in panel A. (D) A GED on the channel covariance  matrices  for the red vs. blue streams was successful  at source separation.  The 
GED eigenvectors,  which form axes GED 1 and GED 2 , are shown in the channel space in panel B. Notice that the sources are correlated  in the data space and in the

expressed  as the dot product  of the row vector with itself. Thus: 
𝜆= ( 𝐰 T 𝐗 𝑆 )( 𝐰 T 𝐗 𝑆 ) T

𝐰 T ( 𝐗 𝑅 𝐗 T 
𝑅 ) 𝐰 (4) 
The parentheses  in Eq. (4) reveal that the solution  to Eq. (1) can be 
developed  through  covariance  matrices.  
A covariance  matrix is an 𝑀 ×𝑀matrix in which the element  in 
row 𝑖 and column  𝑗contains  the covariance  between  channels  𝑀 𝑖 and 
𝑀 𝑗 , deﬁned  as the sum of the element-wise  multiplications  of the mean- 
centered  channel  time series. Thus, the covariance  matrix contains  all 
linear pairwise  interactions.  A covariance  is simply a non-normalized  
Pearson  correlation  coeﬃcient,  and thus a covariance  matrix is a corre- 
lation matrix that retains the scale of the data (e.g., 𝜇𝑉 ). If the data are organized  in a channels-by-time  matrix 𝐗 with 𝑛 time 
points, then the covariance  matrix is given by 
𝐂 = 𝐗𝐗 T ( 𝑛 − 1) −1 (5) 
In general,  the size of the covariance  matrix should be channels-by-  
channels,  and so the multiplication  would be expressed  as 𝐗 T 𝐗 if the 
data were organized  as time-by-channels.  The division  by 𝑛 − 1 is a nor- 
malization  factor that prevents  the covariance  from increasing  simply 
by increasing  the number  of observations  (time points).  
The data must be mean-centered  before the multiplication.  Mean- 
oﬀsets in the data will cause the GED solutions  to point in the direction  
of the oﬀsets instead  of the direction  that maximizes  the desired  opti- 
mization  criterion.  Mean-centering  means that the average  value of each 
channel,  over the time window  used to compute  the covariance  matrix,  
is zero. 
Variance  normalization  is not necessary  if all channels  are in the 
same scale (e.g,. microvolts).  Multimodal  data might need within-  
modality  normalization,  which is discussed  in Section  6.1 . 
MATLAB  code for computing  the covariance  matrix follows  (variable  
data is channels-by-time).

As introduced  in the previous  section,  GED requires  two covariance  
matrices:  the 𝐒 matrix computed  from features  of the data to highlight,  
and the 𝐑 matrix computed  from features  of the data to use as refer- 
ence ( 𝐒 for signal and 𝐑 for reference  ). The signal and reference  data 
should be matched  on as many features  as possible,  similar to how a con- 
trol condition  in an experiment  should be matched  to the experimental  
condition.  In this sense, the GED can be thought  of as maximizing  a 
signal-to-  reference  ratio instead  of a signal-to-  noise ratio. 
If 𝐒 is computed  from a time window  during stimulus  presentation  
and 𝐑 is computed  from a time window  before stimulus  presentation  
(the inter-trial  interval),  then the resulting  GED will isolate the co- 
variance  patterns  that maximally  diﬀerentiate  stimulus  processing  com- 
pared to the inter-trial-interval,  while excluding  any patterns  in the data 
that are present  before and during the stimulus  period, such as ongoing  
spontaneous  activity  or slower neurocognitive  processes  that are unre- 
lated to stimulus  processing.  
Once the two covariance  matrices  are formed,  the goal is to ﬁnd an 
𝑀-element  vector of weights  (called vector 𝐰 ; each element  𝑤 𝑖 is the 
weight for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ data channel),  which acts as a spatial ﬁlter that reduces  
the dimensionality  of the data from 𝑀channels  to 1 component.  The 
elements  in 𝐰 are constructed  such that the linear weighted  sum over 
all channels  maximizes  the ratio of ”multivariate  power ratio ”i n 𝐒 to 
that in 𝐑 . Rewriting  Eq. (4) using covariance  matrices  leads to the form 
𝐰 T 𝐒𝐰 , which is known as the quadratic  form. The quadratic  form is a 
single number  that encodes  the variance  in matrix 𝐒 along direction  𝐰 . 
Therefore,  the goal of GED is to maximize  the ratio of the quadratic  
forms of the two matrices,  where that ratio is encoded  in 𝜆. 
𝜆= 𝐰 T 𝐒𝐰 
𝐰 T 𝐑𝐰 (6) 
This expression  is also known as the generalized  Rayleigh  quotient.  Note 
that when the data covariance  matrices  are the same, 𝜆= 1 , which can 
be considered  the null-hypothesis  value ( H 0 ∶ 𝐒 = 𝐑 ). 
The goal of GED is to ﬁnd the vector 𝐰 that maximizes  𝜆. This is the 
objective  function.  
arg max 𝐰 𝐰 T 𝐒𝐰 
𝐰 T 𝐑𝐰 (7) 
Eq. (7) would produce  only one spatial ﬁlter, however,  it can be ex- 
panded  to include  additional  vectors  𝐰 2 up through  𝐰 𝑀 , with each vec- 
tor 𝐰 𝑖 subject to the constraint  that it maximizes  𝜆𝑖 while being uncorre-  
lated with previous  components  (that is, the components  are orthogonal  
in the GED space, as shown in Fig. 3 ). It can be shown that the expansion  
of one vector to a set of 𝑀vectors  means that Eq. (6) can be rewritten  
as follows.  
𝚲= ( 𝐖 T 𝐑𝐖 ) −1 𝐖 T 𝐒𝐖 (8) 
where each column  of 𝐖 is a spatial ﬁlter, and each diagonal  element  of 
𝚲is the multivariate  ratio in the direction  of the corresponding  column  
in 𝐖 (additional  details on the derivation  of this solution  can be found 
elsewhere,  e.g. Ghojogh  et al., 2019; Parra and Sajda, 2003 ). Some alge- 
braic manipulations  brings us to the matrix solution  to the optimization  
problem:  
𝚲= ( 𝐖 T 𝐑𝐖 ) −1 𝐖 T 𝐒𝐖 (9) 
𝚲= 𝐖 −1 𝐑 −1 𝐖 − T 𝐖 T 𝐒𝐖 (10) 𝚲= 𝐖 −1 𝐑 −1 𝐒𝐖 (11) 
𝐑𝐖 𝚲= 𝐒𝐖 (12) 
Eq. (12) is known as a generalized  eigendecomposition  on matrices  𝐒 
and 𝐑 . This means that the set of weights  that maximizes  the multivari-  
ate signal-to-noise  ratio —the spatial ﬁlter —is an eigenvector,  and the 
value of that ratio is the corresponding  eigenvalue.  It is also useful to 
see that Eq. (12) is conceptually  equivalent  to a “regular  ”eigendecom-  
position  on a matrix product.  
𝐁 = 𝐑 −1 𝐒 (13) 
𝐖𝚲= 𝐁𝐖 (14) 
One of the limitations  of PCA is that the eigenvectors  matrix is orthog-  
onal, meaning  that all components  must be orthogonal.  That constraint  
comes from the eigendecomposition  on a symmetric  matrix,  and all co- 
variance  matrices  are symmetric.  This constraint  is a limitation  because  
sources  that are correlated  in the channel  space cannot be separated  
by PCA (e.g., Fig. 3 ). However,  the product  of two symmetric  matrices  
is generally  not symmetric,  and so the eigenvectors  of a GED may be 
correlated  (though  they are linearly  independent  for distinct  eigenval-  
ues). This is the reason that sources  that are correlated  in channel  space 
can be separated  by GED (and will be orthogonal  in the GED space). 
Also note that matrix 𝐑 is inverted  “on paper ”; in practice,  the GED 
is solved without  explicitly  inverting  matrices  ( Ghojogh  et al., 2019 ), 
which means that GED can be performed  on reduced-rank  data. 
The two matrices  that GED returns contain  pairs of eigenvectors  and 
eigenvalues,  with each eigenvector  (spatial  ﬁlter) having a correspond-  
ing eigenvalue  (multivariate  ratio). In this pairing,  the eigenvector  𝐰 𝑖 
points in a speciﬁc  direction  in the dataspace,  but does not convey the 
importance  of that direction  (the 𝐰 ’s are unit-length  in the space of 𝐑 
because  𝐖 T 𝐑𝐖 = 𝐈 ). In contrast,  the corresponding  eigenvalue  𝜆𝑖 en- 
codes the importance  of the direction,  but is a scalar and therefore  has 
no intrinsic  direction.  The implication  of this is that the eigenvector  as- 
sociated  with the largest eigenvalue  is the spatial ﬁlter that maximizes  
the ratio 𝐒 ∶ 𝐑 along direction  𝐰 1 . The next-largest  eigenvalue  is paired 
with the eigenvector  that maximizes  that ratio while being 𝐑 -orthogonal  
to the ﬁrst direction  (that is, satisfying  the constraint  that 𝐰 T 
2 𝐗 is orthog-  
onal to 𝐰 T 
1 𝐗 Parra et al., 2019 ). And so on for all other directions.  
It is not reasonable  to expect that all components  are meaningful  
and interpretable.  Indeed,  if the two covariance  matrices  are similar to 
each other (e.g., created  from two diﬀerent  experiment  conditions  that 
are matched  on many perceptual  and motor features),  there may be only 
one signiﬁcant  component  —or possibly  no signiﬁcant  components.  The 
GED simply returns all solutions  without  a p -value or conﬁdence  interval  
that would indicate  interpretability.  Inferential  statistics  can be applied  
to the eigenvalue  spectrum,  which is described  in Section  2.4 . 
GED is easy to implement  in MATLAB.  The returned  solutions  are 
not guaranteed  to be sorted by eigenvalue  magnitude,  and thus it is 
convenient  to sort the solution  matrices.  
After sorting,  the component  time series and component  map are cre- 
ated by multiplying  an eigenvector  with, respectively,  the multichannel  
data and the covariance  matrix (discussed  in more detail in Section  3.6 ). 
6  M.X. Cohen NeuroImage  247 (2022) 118809 
Trial-related  data are often stored as 3D matrices  (e.g., channels,  
time, trials), and so the code may need to be modiﬁed  to reshape  the 
data to 2D for the multiplication,  and then back into 3D for further 
analyses.  
The computation  of a component  time series is an important  diver- 
gence from typical machine-learning  classiﬁcation  or discriminant  anal- 
yses: The goal of traditional  classiﬁcation  analyses  is to use 𝐰 to bina- 
rize the data and predict whether  the data were drawn from “class A ”
or “class B ”. However,  the application  of GED described  here results in 
a continuous  time series that has considerably  richer information  than 
a binary class label.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(23503, 23508), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(11465, 11471), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119513,"Introduction  
Human  memory  is generally  considered  to include  two separate  
memory  systems:  Long-term  memory  (LTM) for storing a limitless  
amount  of information  ( Brady et al., 2008 , 2011 ) and Working  mem- 
ory (WM) for temporally  storing a limited amount  of information  which 
is typically  used for performing  ongoing  cognitive  tasks ( Baddeley  and 
Hitch, 1974 ; Cowan,  2001 ). As has been shown in various  behavioral  
studies ( Cantor and Engle, 1993 ; Graesser  and Mandler,  1978 ; Nairne 
and Neath, 2001 ), it is assumed  that LTM information  ﬁrst needs to 
be retrieved  into WM before it can be used to perform  cognitive  tasks 
( Atkinson  and Shiﬀrin,  1968 ; Broadbent,  1975 ; James, 1890 ). Also, pre- 
vious work has indicated  that LTM retrieval  involves  WM, which is 
part of the reason why there are individual  diﬀerences  in WM capac- 
ity ( Cowan et al., 2003 ). 
Most recently,  Fukuda  and Woodman  (2017) provided  direct evi- 
dence for the role of WM in retrieving  information  from LTM. In two 
diﬀerent  tasks, they tracked  information  retrieved  from LTM and com- 
pared that to the neural trace from WM in electroencephalogram  (EEG) 
measures.  In the encoding  task, participants  were trained  to memorize  
learned  (i.e., repeated)  colors, which ultimately  became  stored in LTM; 
while in the retrieval  task, participants  had to retrieve  the colors from

E-mail address: wangbenchi.swift@gmail.com  (B. Wang) . LTM. As indicated  above, WM is a memory  system with limited capacity  
( Cowan,  2001 ) and recent neuroscience  studies have shown that encod- 
ing information  into WM can be measured  by frequency-speciﬁc  oscil- 
lations in EEG signals ( Erickson  et al., 2017 ; Foster et al., 2016 ; Fukuda  
et al., 2016 ). Specially,  the magnitude  of suppression  in alpha-band  os- 
cillations  (8-13 Hz) measured  across parieto-occipital  regions  reaches  a 
plateau  when the maximum  WM storage  capacity  is occupied.  In Fukuda  
and Woodman  (2017) when comparing  old information  retrieved  from 
LTM and new information  encoded  into WM, the results showed  that the 
number  of colors that could be retrieved  from LTM was limited to the 
maximum  WM storage  capacity.  Also, the magnitude  of suppression  in 
alpha-band  oscillations  that tracked  WM storage  capacity  also tracked  
the storage  of information  retrieved  from LTM, implicating  that WM 
buﬀers LTM retrieval.  
Fukuda  and Woodman’s  (2017) ﬁndings  indicate  that WM capacity  
is the limiting  factor in the amount  of information  that can be retrieved  
from LTM. Note, however,  that in their study, WM was not taxed when 
participants  had to retrieve  information  from LTM. Therefore,  it is quite 
feasible  that if WM is not engaged  yet, it is adopted  to accommodate  
information  retrieved  from LTM; Yet, it is unclear  what would happen  
when WM is fully engaged.  That is, when no storage  space is left in WM, 
can people still retrieve  information  from LTM? If so, if WM cannot be 
used to retrieve  information  from LTM what other mechanism  can be

We used 40 unrelated  subjects  (age: 22–35, 20 male) from the 
HCP database  for a connectivity-based  segmentation  of the MD. De- 
tailed demographic  information  about these subjects  was described  
previously  ( Fan et al., 2016 ). To characterize  the connectivity  pat- 
tern of each subregion  and its relationship  with behaviors,  the data 
from 1012 healthy  young adults (age: 22–35; 469 males) with both 
diﬀusion  and functional  imaging  data were extracted  from the S1200 
subjects  release of the WU-Minn  HCP Consortium  ( Van Essen et al., 
2013 ), The data for the subjects  were collected  using a Siemens  3T

2.1.1. Sample size calculation  
Although  this research  was focused  on the investigation  of sev- 
eral ERP components,  only the CNV, cue-P3,  FRN and feedback-P3  
were investigated  with economic  decision-making  tasks ( Di Rosa et al., 
2017 ; Fernandes  et al., 2018 ; Kardos et al., 2017 ; West et al., 2014 ) or 
with monetary  incentives  ( Schmitt  et al., 2015 ). Therefore,  we based 
our power analysis  on the reported  eﬀect sizes in these studies.  Eﬀect 
sizes ranged from medium  ( 𝜂p 2 = 0.114; Fernandes  et al., 2018 ) to large 
( 𝜂p 2 = 0.71; Schmitt  et al., 2015 ; see Table 1 a summary).  Considering  
this range and accounting  for possible  publication  bias, we adopted  a 
conservative  approach  and selected  a small eﬀect size for our sample 
size calculation.  
The sample size was calculated  with GPower  3.1 ( Faul et al., 2007 ). 
We assumed  an eﬀect of f = 0.15 ( 𝛼= 0.05, 1- 𝛽= 0.80) for the main 
eﬀects and interactions  of a repeated  measure  ANOVA  with three 
within-subject  factors (gain, loss, and neutral  conditions),  three groups 
(younger,  middle-aged,  and older adults),  and moderate  correlation  
among amplitudes  ( r = 0.60). Correlation  between  measures  was esti- 
mated from the database  provided  by Fernandes  et al. (2018) , in which 
all correlations  between  FRN and feedback-P3  were larger than r = 0.64. 
The statistical  power analysis  revealed  that a sample size of 75 partici-  
pants would be adequate.  As participants  with less than 20 valid trials 
in each ERP component  were excluded  (see Section  2.1.3 . for exclusion  
criteria),  more participants  were recruited  to ensure the analysis  was 
suﬃciently  powered.  
2.1.2. Inclusion  criteria 
We recruited  healthy  participants  between  20 and 80 years of age,

be included  into two age groups:  younger  adults (20 –40 years), middle-  
aged adults (40–60 years), and older adults (60 –80 years). We aimed 
for, at least, 25 participants  per group.

We tested the entire pipeline  using two whole human brains. The 
ﬁrst specimen,  Case 1, belonged  to a 88 years-old  cognitively  nor- 
mal donor with moderate  AD pathology  (AD neuropathologic  change 
A2B2C1  score ( Montine  et al., 2012 )). The second specimen,  Case 2, be- 
longed to a 76 years-old  donor diagnosed  with dementia  and severe AD 
pathology  (AD neuropathologic  changes  A3B3C3  score). Case 1 under- 
went postmortem  MPRAGE  MRI acquisition,  while Case 2 underwent  
postmortem  SPGE acquisition  within 10 hours of death ( Fig. 1 a). To 
minimize  tissue deformation,  upon autopsy,  we stored the specimens  up- 
side down, hanging  by the circle of Willis for three days. After that, we 
mounted  them in plastic skulls, 3D-printed  from the patient’s  comput-  
erized tomography  (CT) images.  Fixation  continued  for 18 days inside a 
bucket ﬁlled with buﬀered  4% paraformaldehyde  ( Alegro et al., 2016 ). 
Next, the specimens  were embedded  in celloidin.  The brains were sec- 
tioned in serial sets of coronal  slides, each set containing  four 160 𝜇m- 
thick sections.  The section thickness  was selected  to balance  the risk 
of tissue tear and the eﬃciency  of antibody  penetration.  Representa-  
tive 2 ×1 ”celloidin  samples  were cut for paraﬃn  embedding  for neu- 
ropathological  diagnosis  ( Alegro et al., 2016 ). During sectioning,  digital 
photographs  were acquired  directly  from the blockface  following  each 
stroke using a high-deﬁnition,  computer-controlled  DSLR camera  (EOS 
5D Mark II, Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted  on a copy stand arm (Kaiser 
Fototechnik,  Germany)  ( Fig. 1 b). During processing,  brain tissue shrank 
about 30 to 40%. Thus, each coronal  PET scan voxel would contain  at 
least two complete  histological  sets, opening  the opportunity  to probe 
multiple  antibodies  per voxel. Details of tissue processing  celloidin  em- 
bedding  and cutting have been described  by us elsewhere  ( Alegro et al.,

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119250,"2.1. The structural  connectome  
We begin by addressing  the question  of how to describe  the brain’s 
anatomical  architecture  using the tools of graph theory in the ﬁeld of 
network  neuroscience.  For this particular  purpose,  researchers  have fo- 
cused on two complementary  brain imaging  modalities:  structural  and 
diﬀusion  neuroimaging.  Structural  sequences,  including  T1-weighted  
magnetic  resonance  imaging  sequences  (MRIs),  are most commonly  
used to quantify  macroscale  structural  markers  such as cortical  thickness  
and gray matter volume,  due to their high contrast  between  gray and 
white matter.  Diﬀusion-weighted  MRIs are used to assess the presence  
and attributes  of white matter ﬁbers physically  connecting  diﬀerent  re- 
gions across the brain. Both structural  and diﬀusion  sequences  can then be employed  to construct  the brain’s structural  connectome  : a comprehen-  
sive mapping  of its structural  connectivity  patterns  ( Fig. 2 , left ). Note, 
connectomes  derived  from T1-weighted  MRIs are based on covariance  
in regional  structural  properties  and are referred  to as morphometric  
networks  ( Morgan  et al., 2019; Seidlitz  et al., 2018 ). 
The structural  connectome  is formally  represented  as a matrix 
(namely  𝐺) with equal numbers  of rows and columns,  where each row 
and column  indicates  a brain region (more commonly  referred  to as a 
network  node ) and each matrix entry 𝐺 𝑖𝑗 (more commonly  referred  to 
as a network  edge ) captures  how strongly  nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗are connected  
to each other ( Fornito  et al., 2016a ). Edges can take on diﬀerent  deﬁ- 
nitions,  depending  on which imaging  modality  is being used to quan- 
tify them. For instance,  if T1-weighted  MRIs are utilized,  then the edge 
between  two brain regions  usually  represents  the statistical  similarity  
in their corresponding  macroscale  anatomical  markers  (e.g., cortical  
thickness,  gray matter volume,  or surface area). Similarly,  if diﬀusion-  
weighted  MRIs are used, then the edge between  two brain regions  usu- 
ally represents  the number,  density,  or diﬀusion  properties  (e.g., frac- 
tional anisotropy,  apparent  diﬀusion  coeﬃcient)  of white matter tracts 
connecting  these regions  ( Fornito  et al., 2016a ). Such measurements  can 
now be quantiﬁed  by a variety of image processing  pipelines  and asso- 
ciated software  packages  such as DSI Studio ( Yeh et al., 2013 ), QSIPrep  
( Cieslak  et al., 2021 ), MRTRIX  ( Tournier  et al., 2019 ), BEDPOSTx  and 
probtrackx  via FSL ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ), and TRACULA  via FreeSurfer  
( Maﬀei et al., 2021; Yendiki  et al., 2011 ). 
Indeed,  over the past few decades,  diﬀusion-weighted  imaging  (DWI) 
has evolved  into one of the cardinal  neuroimaging  methodologies  to 
non-invasively  capture  white matter organization  and the microstruc-  
tural integrity  of the brain ( Le Bihan and Johansen-Berg,  2012 ). By 
measuring  the Brownian  motion of water molecules,  DWI assesses  the 
magnitude  and direction  of molecule  diﬀusion  across each brain voxel. 
Software  packages  such as the ones mentioned  above, can then be used 
to analyze  the corresponding  diﬀusion  patterns  across the brain, gen- 
erate quantitative  estimates  of ﬁber orientations  within each voxel and 
across multiple  directions,  and utilize these estimates  to infer properties  
of white matter ﬁber tracts connecting  any two voxels ( Baliyan  et al., 
2016; Cieslak  et al., 2018 ). 
Determining  the most biologically  accurate  way to reconstruct,  or 
‘track,’ the underlying  white matter tracts has been a topic of intense  re- 
search. Common  tractography  approaches,  including  deterministic  and 
probabilistic  tractography,  have been employed  to investigate  structural  
connectivity  patterns  in health and disease  ( Cieslak  et al., 2018; For- 
nito et al., 2016b; Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg,  2011; Jeurissen  et al., 
2019; Milano et al., 2019; Sarwar et al., 2019; Sotiropoulos  and Zalesky,  
2019; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Brieﬂy,  deterministic  tractography  algorithms  
typically  start at a seed voxel, identify  its preferred  ﬁber orientation,  
and generate  streamlines  by connecting  consecutive  voxels according  
to their preferred  directions  until a stopping  criterion  is met. The to- 
tal number  of streamlines  passing  between  any two regions  can then 
be counted  to deﬁne their structural  connectivity.  In contrast,  proba- 
bilistic tractography  considers  not only the most probable  ﬁber orien- 
tation at each voxel, but also all other possible  orientations.  Probabilis-  
tic tractography  algorithms  typically  start at a seed voxel where they 
randomly  pick one of the ﬁber orientations  that has been estimated  
within that voxel. Then, a streamline  is propagated  along a neighbor-  
ing voxel, where a ﬁber orientation  is once again randomly  chosen from 
that voxel’s available  distribution.  The streamline  propagation  continues  
along multiple  voxels, up until one of the designated  stopping  criteria  
has been reached.  This general  process  is repeated  multiple  times with a 
diﬀerent  starting  ﬁber orientation.  From a probabilistic  standpoint,  the 
structural  connectivity  between  two regions,  A and B, is then deﬁned  as 
the ratio of [streamlines  originating  from voxels in region A that reach 
voxels in region B] to [the total number  of simulated  streamlines  gen- 
erated from region A]. 
Recently,  a third type of tractography  has been proposed  that calcu- 
lates connectivity  probabilities  between  brain regions  without  relying

Fig. 2. Distinct  connection  types produce  diﬀerent  connectomes  whose architecture  may be described.  The three most common  types of connectivity  utilized 
to elucidate  the brain’s patterns  of connectional  organization  and communication  include structural,  functional,  and eﬀective  connectivity.  Structural  connectivity  
between  two brain regions assesses the presence  and density of white matter ﬁbers physically  connecting  them. Functional  connectivity  between  two brain regions is 
deﬁned as the statistical  similarity  between  their functional  signal time-series.  Eﬀective  connectivity  combines  the notions of structural  and functional  connectivity  
along with biophysical  modeling  to infer directional  (i.e., causal) inﬂuences  between  brain regions. After choosing  a type of connectivity  and extracting  a connectome,  
graph statistics  can be used to describe  the topology  of the observed  interconnection  patterns.  
on extensive  simulations.  This analytic  tractography  approach  derives  
closed-form  solutions  to the tracking  problem,  which can be used to di- 
rectly calculate  voxel-to-voxel  transition  probabilities,  given the voxels’ 
orientation  distribution  functions  and certain biologically-rooted  geo- 
metric constraints  ( Cieslak  et al., 2018 ). These analytic  transition  prob- 
abilities  can then be used as the edge weights  of the structural  connec-  
tome ( Greene et al., 2019 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(17461, 17466), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(7260, 7266), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119124,"Introduction  
Cognitive  training  is seeing growing  use in populations  with diverse  
cognitive  abilities  ( Hill et al., 2017 ; Lampit et al., 2014 ; Tang et al., 
2019 ). Improvements  in the trained  domain  have been demonstrated  
robustly  in older adults for whom the aim is to prevent  or slow cognitive  
decline,  especially  in the context  of dementia  ( Gates et al., 2019 ). How- 
ever, for cognitive  training  to be maximally  clinically  useful, it needs 
to result in beneﬁts  to cognition  more broadly  beyond  the trained  do- 
main: i.e., to show a transfer  eﬀect, and to be feasible  in individuals  at 
higher risk for dementia  who may already  be showing  signs of cognitive  
decline.  It has been proposed  that transfer  relies on the training  of pro- 
cesses that are common  across trained  and untrained  domains  resulting  
in changes  in brain architecture  that go beyond  purely task activation  
patterns  ( Lovden  et al., 2011 ). However,  empirical  ﬁndings  suggest  that 
these common  processes  need to show robust engagement,  which is of- 
ten absent in older adults and those at-risk for dementia  ( Dahlin et al., 
2008 ), to result in transfer.  Taken together,  these ﬁndings  suggest  that, 
to have maximum  clinical  utility, cognitive  training  programs  should 
target neural processes  that 1) show robust engagement  in those at-risk 
for dementia,  2) are domain-general  across a range of cognitive  pro-

neural processes  that meet these criteria  is a key step in understand-  
ing how best to develop  training  programs  that will cause transfer  in 
individuals  at-risk for dementia.  
A key at-risk group is older adults with amnestic  mild cognitive  im- 
pairment  (aMCI),  who have a signiﬁcantly  elevated  risk of progression  
to Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD) ( Sperling  et al., 2011 ), show signs of impair-  
ment predominantly  in memory-related  processes  ( Hirni et al., 2013 ), 
and demonstrate  pathology  in memory-related  regions  ( Braak et al., 
2000 ; Palmqvist  et al., 2017 ; Vogel et al., 2020 ). Studies  have shown 
signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  in how older adults with aMCI engage cognitive  
processes  ( Li et al., 2015 ), with important  implications  for cognitive  
training.  Regions  engaged  during visual attention  (i.e., those in visual 
and attention  networks)  appear to be the least functionally  diﬀerent  in 
aMCI, suggesting  they may represent  a potential  target for eﬀective  cog- 
nitive training.  Tasks that rely on Processing  Speed and Attention  (PS/A) 
are known to activate  these regions,  suggesting  they meet the ﬁrst cri- 
teria for eﬀective  cognitive  training  in aMCI. However,  while training  
using these tasks has been shown to improve  trained  domains  in individ-  
uals with aMCI, there is limited evidence  of transfer  to memory-related  
domains  ( Miotto et al., 2018 ; Rosen et al., 2011 ). Directly  analyzing

The R and STAN code used to apply this method  are provided  in 
an open repository  ( https://github.com/mathesong/SiMBA  _ Materials  ), 
including  a sample simulated  dataset.  The measured  data used in the 
application  section is drawn from previous  studies ( Chen et al., 2019 ). 
4. Simulations  
For the purpose  of assessing  the measurement  properties  of this ap- 
proach,  we generated  simulated  datasets  to compare  the performance  
of the proposed  methodology  to that of the conventional  approach.  
Data were simulated  in order to resemble  the true PET data de- 
scribed  in the next section,  using the [ 11 C]WAY100635  radiotracer.  We 
extracted  the posterior  mean values for all estimated  population  param- 
eters and used these as the “ground  truth ”to generate  realistic  param- 
eter values. For variation  across individuals  and TACs (i.e. Region ×
Individuals),  we sampled  individual  new parameter  values from the uni- 
variate and multivariate  normal  distributions,  while for variation  across 
regions,  we made use of the posterior  mean values. In this way, we sim- 
ulate from the same set of regions,  but in a new set of individuals,  with 
a new set of individual  variations  at the regional  level. The simulation  
parameters  are described  in Supplementary  Materials  S2. 
TACs were simulated  using the two-tissue  compartment  model us- 
ing these parameter  values, with blood data randomly  sampled  from 
individuals  (with replacement)  from the measured  data. Measurement  
error was added to the simulated  curves using a normal  distribution  with 
mean 0, and the standard  deviation  determined  in a similar manner  as 
for the pharmacokinetic  parameters,  i.e. using the posterior  means for 
regional  diﬀerences,  but sampling  individual  diﬀerences  from the uni- 
variate normal  distribution.  As before, this has the eﬀect of simulating  
data from the same set of regions,  but in a new set of individuals.  To 
this, we added the global mean value of the SD of the measurement  er- 
ror, for which we used 10% of the mean TAC value. Rather than using 
the value estimated  from the data, we opted to select a value which 
facilitates  comparison  with other data sets, and which more closely re- 
sembles  a worst-case  scenario.  This value is approximately  double that 
estimated  from the measured  PET data. Finally,  we also added the poste- 
rior mean value of the smooth  function  for each time point within each 
TAC. 
In order to evaluate  the sensitivity  and speciﬁcity  of the approach,  
we tested for group diﬀerences.  To evaluate  power, we simulated  two 
groups,  with a true global (i.e., across all 9 regions)  group diﬀerence  of 
20% in 𝐵𝑃 ND (i.e., Δlog( 𝐵𝑃 ND ) = 0.182).  
Based on the mean posterior  standard  deviation  of 𝐵𝑃 ND across in- 
dividuals  in the sample,  this corresponds  with a moderate  eﬀect size 
(Cohen’s  d = 0.55). 
To evaluate  the potential  for false positives,  we also tested for group 
diﬀerences  in simulated  data sets for which there were no diﬀerences.  
No additional  covariates,  such as age or sex, were included,  other 
than that of group membership.  
We simulated  datasets  with group sizes of multiples  of 10 between  10 
and 100 (i.e., for a group size of 20, there are 20 controls  and 20 patients,  
and therefore  40 individuals  included  in the study). For the NLS models,  
we generated  1000 simulated  studies for each condition,  i.e. for groups 
of 50, this results in a number  of TACs of 1000 ×2 conditions  (group 
diﬀerences  vs no group diﬀerences)  ×50 individuals  ×2 groups ×9 
regions.  For the estimation  of NLS parameters,  each TAC was ﬁtted 10 
times with randomly  sampled  starting  parameters  and the best ﬁt was 
selected  using the nls.multstart  package  ( Padﬁeld  and Matheson,  2018 ), 
to ensure that ﬁts were optimal.  In all cases, outcome  parameters  were 
calculated  directly  using the rate constants,  and not indirectly  using a reference  tissue, i.e. 𝐵𝑃 ND = 𝑘 3 
𝑘 4 . It should be noted that the calculation  
of 𝐵𝑃 ND in this manner  is not a recommended  practice  using NLS, as it 
is known to be prone to error ( Parsey et al., 2000; Slifstein  and Laruelle,  
2001 ). However,  as we show below, direct estimation  of 𝐵𝑃 P is more 
accurate,  and can be considered  a better index of potential  performance  
of NLS rather than 𝐵𝑃 ND . 
For SiMBA,  ﬁtting the model to so many datasets  would have in- 
curred a very large computational  burden owing to the greater compu-  
tational  requirements.  Instead,  we limited sample sizes to group sizes of 
10, 20 and 50, and generated  only 50 simulated  studies for each con- 
dition. Applying  the model to these datasets  resulted  in approximately  
1.5 core years of processing.  
4.1. Comparison  of power for detecting  group diﬀerences  
Using the simulated  data described  above, we performed  inference  
on group diﬀerences  to determine  the power or sensitivity,  i.e., true 
positives,  and speciﬁcity,  i.e., false positives,  of the model. 
For inference  for the NLS results,  we performed  both t-tests and 
linear mixed eﬀects (LME) modelled  using the generated  outcome  pa- 
rameters  after being transformed  to their natural  logarithms.  Welch’s  
t-tests were ﬁt for each region separately,  while the LME model was 
applied  across all regions,  with ﬁxed eﬀects for region and for group 
membership,  and a random  intercept  for individuals.  These are both 
common  strategies  employed  in clinical  PET studies,  which are used 
as a basis for comparison.  Although  for global diﬀerences  the LME 
model is obviously  more appropriate,  t-tests are often employed  in PET 
studies,  even when diﬀerences  are global: our intent was not to com- 
pare these two approaches  with one another,  but to provide  an ap- 
propriate  baseline  comparison  for the SiMBA model. P-values  for the 
LME were calculated  using the lmerTest  package  ( Kuznetsova  et al., 
2017 ). 
For the hierarchical  Bayesian  model, binary inferences  were deter- 
mined by assessing  whether  the 95% credible  interval  of the posterior  
estimate  of the group diﬀerence  included  or excluded  zero. Due to the 
small sample size, we ﬁt logspline  density  functions  ( Stone et al., 1997 ) 
to both the upper and lower bounds  of the 95% credible  intervals  across 
simulations,  and estimated  the proportion  of the distributions  for which 
the estimates  would not include  zero using their cumulative  density  
functions.  The logspline  ﬁts were visually  assessed,  and estimates  were 
closely aligned  with the empirical  estimates  (Supplementary  Materials  
S3). For this reason,  we have included  95% conﬁdence  intervals  around 
the estimated  power for SiMBA.  Furthermore,  in order to conﬁrm  that 
the diﬀerent  simulated  datasets  did not induce any bias, we also per- 
formed  all NLS analyses  using the same data to which SiMBA was ap- 
plied, using both empirical  and logspline  estimation,  which produced  
very similar results (Supplementary  Materials  S4). We calculated  95% 
conﬁdence  intervals  for the power using bootstrap  resampling,  i.e., by 
repeating  the logspline  procedure  for 1000 samples  of the 50 outcomes  
sampled  with replacement.  
As shown in Fig. 3 , we show that the LME model exhibits  greater 
power compared  to regional  t-tests as expected,  and we show that the 
SiMBA model exhibits  substantially  increased  power relative  to both of 
these methods.  This suggests  that SiMBA demonstrates  greater sensitiv-  
ity to detect true diﬀerences  between  groups for the same sample size, 
exhibiting  power equivalent  to sample sizes of approximately  double 
using NLS estimation  and LME. We also show that no models exhibit 
a false positive  rate that is signiﬁcantly  or substantially  diﬀer from 5% 
( Fig. 4 ). Taken together,  this suggests  that SiMBA is more sensitive  than 
the traditional  NLS methods,  without  sacriﬁcing  speciﬁcity  
Although  LME applied  to 𝐵𝑃 ND shows poor performance  in Fig. 3 , 
likely owing to poor estimation,  LME applied  to 𝐵𝑃 P exhibits  similar or 
only marginally  reduced  power compared  to when LME is applied  to the 
true values. This supports  direct estimation  of BP P as a good index of 
speciﬁc  binding  using NLS.

Figure 2 illustrates  the structure  of the ""xifti""  object class. It is 
organized  as a nested list with three entries at the ﬁrst level: data , the 
data matrices  for each brain structure;  surf , the left and right cortical  
surface geometries;  and meta , the various  metadata  including  medial 
wall masks (see Appendix  B for information  about the medial wall), 
subcortical  labels and mask, and CIFTI intent-speciﬁc  information.  If 
any entry is not present  in the ""xifti""  it will have a value of NULL . 
Since a ""xifti""  is a list, its contents  can be parsed with $ . For example,  
xii$meta$cifti$intent  returns the CIFTI intent of the ""xifti""  ob- 
ject xii . 
The left and right cortical  surface geometries  are themselves  objects 
of class ""surf""  . A ""surf""  object is a list with three entries:  vertices  , 
faces , and hemisphere  . A ""surf""  object can also exist separately

Table 1 
Summary  of comparison  between  programmatic  tools for CIFTI and GIFTI ﬁles. Checkmarks  are assigned  if the 
tool (rows) directly enables a user to complete  the task (columns).  A “3 ”for CIFTI functionalities  in ciftiTools  
indicates  that only three CIFTI intents are supported:  “dtseries,  ”“dscalar,  ”and “dlabel. ”Moreover,  tools receiving  
checkmarks  in the same column may enable the task to diﬀerent  extents. For example,  the manipulation  functions  
in hcp-utils  support normalizing  data values and applying  a parcellation,  whereas  those in cifti-matlab  
support data and metadata  replacement.  While ciftiTools  is designed  to support all listed tasks, other tools are 
not meant to support all these tasks on their own. For example,  hcp-utils  is designed  to be used in conjunction  
with NiBabel  and nilearn  . Lastly, note that some tools have external  dependencies:  ciftiTools  also requires  
the Connectome  Workbench  for most of its functionality,  ggsegExtra  requires  FreeSurfer  for reading in new 
parcellations,  and ciftify  uses FSL, FreeSurfer  and the Connectome  Workbench  to convert and manipulate  CIFTI 
ﬁles. An asterisk has been added to the “Language  ”c o l u m n  for these tools to indicate  the need for additional  
software.

and manipulation  of surface geometry  data in the absence  of metric or 
label data. 
The function  is.xifti  can be used to verify that an R object is a 
correctly-formatted  ""xifti""  object. This validation  is especially  useful 
if the user has manually  manipulated  the data or metadata  in a ""xifti""  
and requires  it to be correctly  formatted,  for example  if they plan to 
write it to a ﬁle, visualize  it, or further process  it with ciftiTools  . 
Several  S3 methods  are implemented  in ciftiTools  . S3 methods  
control the behaviors  of certain base R functions  when applied  to ob- 
jects of a speciﬁc  class. Currently,  ""xifti""  objects have S3 methods  
for summary  , print , plot , and several mathematical  operations.  For 
example,  plot(xii)  will invoke the functions  view_xifti_surface  
and/or view_xifti_volume  , as described  in Section  2.3 . ""surf""  
objects have S3 methods  for summary  , print , and plot . For both 
""xifti""  and ""surf""  objects,  summary  and print will display  an 
overview  of the object’s  contents.  Other S3 methods  for ""xifti""  and 
""surf""  objects are described  in the corresponding  subsections  below.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9911, 9916), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3935, 3941), match='\n2.2. '>"

normal  or corrected-to-normal  vision and reported  no history of psy- 
chiatric  or neurological  disorders,  or use of psychoactive  medications.  
They were screened  for contraindications  to fMRI and gave written  in- 
formed  consent  before participation.  Of the 30 subjects  who enrolled  
in the fMRI experiment,  23 agreed to come back twice, to take part in 
two sessions  of the behavioral  study (13 females;  mean age 24.6 years

item (even though this is highly unlikely,  given the strongly  language-biased  
stimuli used in this context).  To ensure this is not the case, the actual responses  
produced  by each participant  were carefully  checked  in order to verify that lan- 
guage choices were indeed consistent.  Table 2

Given the compatibility  of our pipeline  with BioImage  Suite, we term 
it: BIS-MID  (BioImage  Suite - Mesoscale  Imaging  Data). The data taken 
as input are from a standard  dual-wavelength  experiment  ( Fig. 1 ). In ad- 
dition to the two-dimensional  optical imaging  data, BIS-MID  can accept 
an accompanying  ‘trigger’  ﬁle that indicates  the ﬂuorophore-sensitive  
and ﬂuorophore-insensitive  frames.  Alternatively,  BIS-MID  can produce  
a semi-automated  trigger array, so this ﬁle is not required.  For motion 
correction,  a reference  frame is required  (set by default or by the user, 
2.1.2 ). Finally,  a binary brain mask that delineates  tissue from back- 
ground  is required.  We recommend  generating  this mask using the ref- 
erence frame. Although  the automated  generation  of a brain mask from 
mesoscale  imaging  data has been described  ( Xiao et al., 2021 ), we ﬁnd 
user-drawn  masks to be more robust to image artifacts.  Inputs are sum- 
marized  in Table 1 . Table 1

The study workﬂow  has four phases:  (1) input triage ( Table 1 ), (2) 
application  of preprocessing  algorithms  ( Fig. 2 ), (3) QC output evalu- 
ation, and (4) subsequent  analyses.  Phase One consists  of ﬁle conver-  
sion and splitting  of the ﬂuorescence-sensitive  and -insensitive  imaging  
frames.  Phase Two takes these ﬁles (and the brain mask) and applies al- 
gorithms  to remove  noise that are divided  between  spatial and temporal

operations.  Phase Three is a user guided evaluation  of the QC metrics  
output by phase two (e.g., framewise  displacement,  FD, estimates  of 
subject motion).  These metrics  can guide parameter  optimization  and 
should be used as subject inclusion  criteria.  Phase Four is mostly be- 
yond the scope of BIS-MID  and depends  on the user’s application.  We 
describe  example  analyses  and results ( 2.3 , 2.4 , and 2.5 ). Example  out- 
puts from the workﬂow  (QC) for our shared data ( 2.2 ) are available  from

Injectable  tract tracers in animals  have been used since the early 
1980s to identify  patterns  of connectivity  between  injected  targets and 
the matrix and striosome  compartments.  We identiﬁed  publications  
that utilized  injected  tract tracing techniques  to study striatal compart-  
ment connectivity  using serial Pubmed  searches  with “striatum  inject ”
and one of the following  terms: matrix,  striosome,  patch, or compart-  
ment. We sought to identify  any study that characterized  connectivity  
with the striatum  at the compartment  level, including  those that uti- 
lized tritiated  amino acids, biocytin,  cholera  toxin B, FluoroGold  TM ,

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118836,"2.1. Resting ‐state MINDy modeling  
The MINDy  model ( Singh et al., 2020a; 2020b ) is a phenomenolog-  
ical extension  of neural-mass  type models which operates  at timescales  
commensurate  with fMRI. Like neural-mass  models,  MINDy  models 
contain  three components:  a signed, directed  weight matrix of esti- 
mated eﬀective  connectivities  ( 𝑊 ), a sigmoidal  transfer  function  ( 𝜓) 
which relates local activation  to the strength  of outward  signaling,  and 
the region-speciﬁc  decay rate (time-constant)  𝐷which describes  how 
quickly  a stimulated  region will return to baseline  levels of activity.  
MINDy  models operate  at two time-frames:  the time-frame  of neural 
activity  (denoted  𝜏) and the time-frame  of BOLD measurements  (de- 
noted 𝑡 ) which we assume  are linked by a region-speciﬁc  hemodynamic-  
response-function  ℎ 𝛽. The resting-state  neural activity  ( 𝑥 𝜏) evolves  ac- 
cording  to the discrete-time  dynamical  system:  
𝑥 𝜏+1 = 𝑓( 𝑥 𝜏) + 𝜉𝜏 (1) 
𝑓( 𝑥 𝜏) ∶= 𝑊 𝜓 𝛼( 𝑥 𝜏) + (1 − 𝐷) 𝑥 𝜏 (2) with process  noise 𝜉𝜏assumed  uncorrelated  between  parcels.  The trans- 
fer function  𝜓is parameterized  by the curvature  vector 𝛼which dictates  
regional-diﬀerences  in the shape of 𝜓: 
𝜓 𝛼( 𝑥 𝜏) ∶= √ 
𝛼2 + ( 𝑏𝑥 𝜏+ . 5) 2 − √ 
𝛼2 + ( 𝑏𝑥 𝜏− . 5) 2 (3) 
with 𝑏 = 20∕3 a ﬁxed, global hyperparameter.  These neural equations  
are linked to the observed  BOLD measurements  via the convolutional  
HRF model. We model HRFs using a parameterized  version  of the canon- 
ical double-gamma  model with vector-valued  parameters  𝛽1 , 𝛽2 : 
ℎ 𝛽( 𝑡 ) ∶= 𝑡 𝛽1 −1 𝑒 − 𝛽2 𝑡 𝛽𝛽1 
2 
Γ( 𝛽1 ) − 𝑡 15 𝑒 − 𝑡 
6(16!) (4) 
𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 = [ ℎ 𝛽∗ 𝑥 ] 𝑡 + 𝜈𝑡 (5) 
MINDy  quickly  and simultaneously  solves for 𝑊 , 𝛼, 𝐷, and 𝛽using a 
unique,  regularized  optimization  method  ( Singh et al., 2020a; 2020b ). 
Neural states are inverted  from BOLD using the Wiener  deconvolution  
( Weiner,  1949 ). Gaussian  noise at the level of BOLD measurements  is 
denoted  𝜈𝑡 which is assumed  independent  in time and between  parcels.  
Denoting  complex-conjugation  by 𝑧 ∗ , the Fourier-transform  by and 
the Wiener  NSR parameter  𝜀 = 0 . 002 (see SI Section  7.4 ), we deﬁne the 
Wiener  HRF-deconvolution  (  + ) as: 
 + 
𝛽[ 𝑌 ] ∶=  −1 [  [ ℎ 𝛽] ∗  [ 𝑌 ] 
‖[ ℎ 𝛽] ‖2 + 𝜀 ] 
(6) 
All multiplications/divisions  in the above equation  are understood  to 
be element-wise.  We similarly  implement  convolution  using the Fourier  
transform  (by the Convolution  Theorem:  [ 𝑥 ∗ 𝑦 ] = [ 𝑥 ] [ 𝑦 ]) : 
ℎ 𝛽∗ 𝑥 =  −1 [ [ ℎ 𝛽]  [ 𝑥 ] ](7) 
Thus, the combined  MINDy  model for resting-state  (excluding  noise) 
is: 
𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 +1 = ℎ 𝛽∗ [ 
𝑊 𝜓 𝛼( + 
𝛽[ 𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 ] )+ (1 − 𝐷)  + 
𝛽[ 𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 ] ] 
(8) 
Since the exact convolution  and deconvolution  operators  cancel for the 
decay-term  (as opposed  to our numerical  methods),  we ignore these 
steps for the linear decay component  to reduce bias (less spectral  ﬁl- 
tering).  Our ﬁnal model is thus: 
𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 +1 = ℎ 𝛽∗ [ 
𝑊 𝜓 𝛼( + 
𝛽[ 𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 ] )] 
+ (1 − 𝐷) 𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑡 (9)",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(15414, 15419), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3050, 3056), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119385,"2.1. Mendelian  randomisation  
We ﬁrst give a review of Mendelian  randomisation  before intro- 
ducing other related methods  that attempt  to make causal inferences,  
namely  mediation  analysis  and Bayesian  Networks.  The use of MR has 
grown steadily,  due in part to greater availability  of large-scale  GWAS. 
In the following,  we provide  a high-level  introduction  to MR. For a de- 
tailed study we recommend  recent reviews  ( Bowden  and Holmes,  2019; 
Lawlor et al., 2019; Sanderson  et al., 2022; Tin and Köttgen,  2021 ) and 
the comprehensive  textbook  by Burgess  and Thompson  (2015a)  . Mendelian  randomisation  is based on the principle  of using genetic  
variants  as “instrumental  variables  ”( s e e Fig. 1 ) to investigate  causal 
relationships  in observational  data ( Davey Smith and Ebrahim,  2003; 
2004 ). Instrumental  variable  analysis  is an established  methodology  in 
the ﬁelds of econometrics,  statistics  and epidemiology  ( Lawlor et al., 
2008 ). In addition  to exposure  and outcome,  an instrument  is a third 
variable  that inﬂuences  the outcome  exclusively  via its eﬀect on the 
exposure.  Schematically,  in the causal chain 𝑍 →𝑋 →𝑌 , the variable  
𝑍is an instrument  for the 𝑋 − 𝑌 relationship.  
For example,  consider  the question  of impact of alcohol  consump-  
tion on liver health. There are many other factors that can inﬂuence  
both the level of alcohol  intake and risk for liver disease,  such as gen- 
eral health, diet, exercise  and level of education.  Additionally,  it could 
be the case that liver disease  aﬀects alcohol  intake. The availability  of 
alcoholic  beverages  (across diﬀerent  countries  or due to diﬀerent  levels 
of taxation),  however,  provides  an instrumental  variable  that inﬂuences  
the chances  of an individual  consuming  alcohol  but has no direct eﬀect 
on liver health. Therefore,  observational  data on alcohol  consumption  
as predicted  by availability  can be associated  with measures  of liver 
health to obtain a less confounded  estimate  of the eﬀect of alcohol  on 
the liver. 2 As in most scenarios,  there are caveats  and limitations  to con- 
sider in this example.  For instance,  socio-economic  variables  will play a 
non-trivial  role for health outcomes,  levels of alcohol  consumption  and 
impact of taxation.  Careful  consideration  of potential  biases and validity  
of assumptions  is therefore  necessary.  
In the remainder  of this work, we will use the following  example  
concerning  the eﬀect of blood pressure  on cardiovascular  health: A cor- 
relation  between  higher blood pressure  and coronary  heart disease  does 
not prove a causal eﬀect of one on the other, since common  causes (BMI 
for instance)  may inﬂuence  both blood pressure  levels and risk of heart 
disease.  The inclusion  of a new, instrumental  variable,  that is causally  
linked to blood pressure  (for example,  a speciﬁc  genetic  variant),  but has 
no direct inﬂuence  on the outcome,  allows one to separate  true causal 
eﬀects of blood pressure  on heart disease  from spurious  correlations  due 
to BMI and other confounds.  
In MR, the validity  of the instrumental  variables  rests on the laws 
of Mendelian  inheritance,  in particular  the principle  of random  assort- 
ment of parent alleles during meiosis.  The fact that the composition  of 
the genetic  code is ﬁxed at conception  precludes  any environmental  in- 
ﬂuences  or eﬀects of lifestyle  factors.  This means that genetic  variants  
are (mostly)  unaﬀected  by issues of confounding  and reverse  causation.  
In other words, comparing  groups of individuals  with a diﬀerent  genetic  
makeup  at speciﬁc  locations  of the genome  (e.g., single-nucleotide  poly- 
morphisms  or SNPs) provides  a chance to detect a causal eﬀect between  
genetically-determined  levels of the exposure  and an outcome  of inter- 
est, without  many of the limitations  in other observational  studies that 
are due to confounding  eﬀects 3 MR examines  the observed  association  
between  outcome  and genotype-predicted  exposure.  Because  of the in- 
2 In economics  and epidemiology,  scenarios  involving  observational  data and 
exposures  outside the control of the investigator  are also known as “natural  
experiments  ”.

mutability  of an individual’s  genotype,  any robustly  identiﬁed  eﬀect can 
be directly  attributed  to the exposure.  
It should be noted that, although  largely valid, there exist some 
caveats  to the assumption  of a fully random  distribution  of genetic  vari- 
ants among the population  (see also Section  2.4 ). For a thorough  discus- 
sion of the “MR-as-nature’s-randomised-controlled-trial  ”analogy  and its 
limitations,  see Swanson  et al. (2017) . 
2.1.1. Instrumental  variables  
For any instrumental  variable  (IV) analysis,  there are three main as- 
sumptions  that a candidate  IV must satisfy to be a valid IV ( Burgess  
and Thompson,  2015a; Haycock  et al., 2016 ): 1) The IV is associated  
with the exposure  (relevance  assumption);  2) There are no unmeasured  
confounders  of the association  between  IV and outcome  (independence  
assumption);  3) The IV is only associated  with the outcome  via the ex- 
posure (exclusion  restriction).  A schematic  summary  of the standard  MR 
setup and the three IV assumptions  is depicted  in the causal diagrams  
in Fig. 1 . 
As an illustrative  example,  consider  the SNP rs35479618,  which 
has been found to be strongly  associated  with systolic  blood pressure  
( Liu et al., 2016 ). In a uni-variable  analysis,  this single SNP is the in- 
strument  ( 𝑍), systolic  blood pressure  (BP) is the exposure  ( 𝑋) and coro- 
nary artery disease  (CAD) is the outcome  ( 𝑌 ). Absent any direct as- 
sociations  of the SNP with confounds  and the outcome,  the simplest  
MR estimate  for the causal eﬀect of BP on CAD is given by the ratio 
of the SNP–outcome  association  to the SNP–exposure  association.  Con- 
cretely,  using GWAS data on BP (GWAS  ID: ukb-b-20175  ( Mitchell  et al., 
2019 )) and CAD (GWAS  ID: ebi-a-GCST005195  ( Van Der Harst and Ver- 
weij, 2018 )), both accessed  via the MRC IEU OpenGWAS  data infras- 
tructure  ( Elsworth  et al., 2020 ), the SNP–BP  association  is 0.0617 (i.e., 
0.0617 SD change in BP associated  with change in SNP dosage)  and 
the SNP–CAD  association  is 0.0652 (odds ratio change associated  with 
change in SNP dosage).  The causal eﬀect of BP on coronary  artery dis- 
ease is therefore  𝛽= 0 . 0652∕0 . 0617 = 1 . 06 . Since CAD is a binary variable,  
the eﬀect estimate  is given as a log odds ratio of CAD occurring  for a 
one-standard-deviation  increase  in BP. In binary case–control  scenarios,  
log-linear  or logistic  regression  models are often preferred,  where the 
eﬀect estimate  then corresponds  to the log relative  risk or log-odds  ra- 
tio, respectively  ( Burgess  et al., 2017b ). However,  due to small eﬀects 
of SNPs, linear models generally  approximate  logistic  models well and 
are therefore  widely used in MR analyses.  
By inference  methods  we describe  below, a p-value  can be computed,  
here p = 0.017; although  nominally  signiﬁcant,  the 95% conﬁdence  in- 
terval for the eﬀect estimate  (95% CI [0 . 19 , 1 . 94] ) is very large. Multi- 
variable  analyses  that simultaneously  use many SNPs as instrumental  
variables  generally  have higher power to detect an eﬀect and allow for 
the application  of more advanced  MR methods  as well as sensitivity  
analyses.  
Crucially,  the validity  of the instrumental  variable  assumptions  is a 
necessary  prerequisite  for the causal interpretation  of Mendelian  ran- 
domisation  results.  In practice,  a potential  violation  of the second and 
third assumption  can often not be ruled out and causal conclusions  need 
to be drawn carefully.  However,  there are an increasing  number  of sen- 
sitivity analyses  as well as robust MR methods  available  that can aid 
in the identiﬁcation  of bias, and support  tentative  causal claims (see 
Section  2.1.5 ). 
2.1.2. Individual-  vs. summary-level  data 
MR can be performed  using individual  subject-level  data or sum- 
mary statistics  from large-scale  genome-wide  association  studies (i.e., 
3 Although  the vast majority  of MR studies uses SNPs as instrumental  vari- 
ables, other genetic variants  such as indels and genetic variants  associated  with 
diﬀerent  gene expression  or protein levels (eQTLs, pQTLs) can be used as instru- 
ments. For simplicity,  we only refer to SNPs in this work. regression  coeﬃcients  and standard  errors of the SNP–phenotype  asso- 
ciations).  Although,  conceptually,  the two approaches  are equivalent,  
in practice,  each has its own beneﬁts  and drawbacks.  Individual-level  
MR allows one to test and adjust for suspected  SNP–confounder  asso- 
ciations  and to perform  subgroup  analyses,  but usually  has lower sta- 
tistical power to detect causal eﬀects due to smaller  sample sizes. Sum- 
mary statistics  from international  GWAS consortia  on the other hand are 
readily available  and often based on very large sample sizes, and are 
commonly  used in so-called  two-sample  MR, where the SNP–exposure  
and SNP–outcome  associations  are estimated  on two separate  datasets  
( Burgess  et al., 2015 ). Individual-level  data is often used in one-sample  
MR, which is more prone to overﬁtting  due to weak instrument  bias 
(see Section  2.4 ). One-sample  settings  have the potential  beneﬁt that 
MR results can be linked to other analyses  involving  the same indi- 
viduals,  whereas  two-sample  analyses  would be problematic  if the two 
data sets diﬀer substantially  in their population  characteristics  (ethnic-  
ity, sex, age, socio-economic  status, etc.) ( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). 
Because  of potential  bias due to sample overlap  and weak instru- 
ments, two-sample  MR is commonly  preferred  in practice.  However,  the 
two datasets  in two-sample  MR must represent  the same population,  and 
summary  eﬀect estimates  need to be harmonised  across the two datasets.  
Some specialised  MR approaches  are only available  for individual-  
level data, such as factorial  MR to assess interactions  ( Rees et al., 
2020 ) and non-linear  MR ( Silverwood  et al., 2014; Staley and Burgess,  
2017 ). Recent advances  in methodology  continue  to expand  the avail- 
ability of MR variants  to summary-level  data, for example,  methods  for 
identifying  violations  of the exclusion  restriction,  known as horizontal  
pleiotropy,  via gene-by-environment  interactions  ( Spiller et al., 2019 ). 
For the remainder  of this paper, we will focus on summary-level  MR 
methods  since these are i) more common,  ii) easier to carry out, and iii) 
as far as neuroimaging  phenotypes  are concerned,  summary  statistics  
from population  studies such as UK Biobank  are essentially  the only 
available  data with large enough  sample sizes (ideally,  𝑁 ≫10 4 ). 
2.1.3. SNP Selection  and pre-processing  
Genetic  variants  are usually  selected  based on a signiﬁcance  thresh- 
old of the SNP–exposure  association  from GWAS results (typically  𝑝 < 
5 ×10 −8 , but might have to be adjusted  based on sample size). For a single 
SNP, this p-value  is an indirect  measure  of the eﬀect size but crucially  
also depends  on overall sample size and frequency  of occurrence  (the 
minor allele frequency  or MAF) of the genetic  variant in the sampled  
data ( Swerdlow  et al., 2016 ). If prior knowledge  is available  on which 
gene or gene region is implicated  in the regulation  of the exposure  of 
interest,  then the selection  of genetic  variants  can be restricted  to that 
region of the genome  only. This approach  has been used successfully,  
for example,  to determine  the causal eﬀect of LDL cholesterol  on coro- 
nary heart disease  while ruling out the HDL variant ( van der Graaf et al., 
2020; Schmidt  et al., 2020 ). Otherwise,  a polygenic  analysis  involving  
genetic  variants  from potentially  multiple  genetic  regions  is performed.  
Most robust MR methods  assume  independence  between  SNPs, and thus 
it is important  to have SNPs suﬃciently  separated  in genetic  distance  
( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). Additionally,  the inclusion  of polygenic  variants  
that explain  independent  parts of the exposure–variance  (i.e., with dif- 
ferent biological  pathways  from the genetic  variants  to the exposure)  
improves  the statistical  power to detect a causal eﬀect. 
Prominent  metrics  for instrument  selection  include  the proportion  
of variance  explained  ( 𝑅 2 ) and the F-statistic  4 of the exposure-on-SNP  
regression  model ( Burgess  and Thompson,  2011; Swerdlow  et al., 2016 ). 
A threshold  of 𝐹 > 10 is conventionally  considered  as an indicator  for 
suﬃciently  strong instruments.  
MR analyses  that involve  more than a single genetic  variant require  
the clumping  of SNPs as a preprocessing  step. This ensures  that the SNPs

𝑗 ( 𝑁 − 1 − 𝑘 )]∕[(1 − 𝑅 2 
𝑗 ) 𝑘 ] , with GWAS sample size 𝑁, 
number of SNPs 𝑘 and proportion  of exposure  variance  explained  by SNPs 𝑅 2 . 
In multivariable  MR, the conditional  F-statistic  should be used instead. 
3  B. Taschler, S.M. Smith and T.E. Nichols NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119385 
used as instrumental  variables  for the exposure  are independent.  SNPs 
with allele frequencies  that vary together  to a degree outside  of what 
would be expected  from a random,  independent  association  are consid-  
ered to be in linkage  disequilibrium  (LD). A reference  database  such as 
the 1000 Genomes  reference  panel ( Altshuler  et al., 2010 ) can be used 
to calculate  LD 𝑅 2 values for a set of selected  SNPs. Above a certain cut- 
oﬀ(typically  𝑅 2 > 0 . 001 ), only the SNP with the lowest p-value  for the 
SNP–exposure  association  is retained,  thus “clumping  ”together  (though  
in actuality,  discarding)  covarying  SNPs. 
In two-sample  MR, care must be taken to ensure that the GWAS- 
reported  eﬀect of a selected  SNP on the exposure  (in one dataset)  
and the reported  eﬀect of the same SNP on the outcome  (in another  
dataset)  correspond  to the same allele. Updates  to the human genome  
reference  sequence  as well as changes  in the way GWAS data are re- 
ported mean that SNP annotation  often diﬀers between  genotyping  plat- 
forms, datasets  and repositories,  making  mismatches  a common  prob- 
lem. MR software  such as the TwoSampleMR  ( Hemani  et al., 2018b ) 
and MendelianRandomization  ( Yavorska  and Burgess,  2017 ) R 
packages  include  harmonisation  procedures  that can infer the correct 
allele alignment  as automated  preprocessing  steps. 
2.1.4. Standard  MR methods  
The causal eﬀect estimate  for the elementary  case based on 
summary-level  data and a single SNP is simply given by the ratio of 
the SNP–outcome  association  to the SNP–exposure  association  5 From 
the regression  model for the SNP–exposure  association  𝛾𝐸 on the SNP–
outcome  association  𝛾𝑂 , we have ̂𝛾𝐸 = 𝛽̂𝛾𝑂 + 𝜖, where 𝜖denotes  the error 
term; the eﬀect estimate  is then obtained  as ̂𝛽= ̂𝛾𝑂 ∕ ̂𝛾𝐸 6 When multiple  
SNPs are available,  the ratio estimates  for each SNP can be combined  
in a meta-analytic  fashion  to estimate  an overall causal eﬀect ( Bowden  
et al., 2016a; Burgess  et al., 2013 ). This constitutes  the standard  inverse-  
variance  weighted  (IVW) MR method.  
Several  meta-analytic  approaches  are possible,  including  ﬁxed- 
eﬀects, additive  random-eﬀects  and multiplicative  random-eﬀects  mod- 
els. Their suitability  is determined  by the presence  of heterogeneity  and 
pleiotropy.  In the presence  of balanced  pleiotropy,  that is when posi- 
tive and negative  pleiotropic  eﬀects on the outcome  on average  cancel 
out, ﬁxed-eﬀects  and additive  random-eﬀects  meta-analyses  are both 
unbiased.  A diﬀerence  in their respective  eﬀect estimates  indicates  di- 
rectional  (unbalanced)  pleiotropy,  in which case a ﬁxed-eﬀects  model is 
preferred.  If strong heterogeneity  (large variance  in individual  SNP es- 
timates)  is detected,  an additive  random-eﬀects  model will give greater 
weight to weaker  (and more biased)  single-SNP  estimates  and a multi- 
plicative  random-eﬀects  model is recommended  ( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). 
In a multiplicative  random-eﬀects  model, heterogeneity  in the single- 
SNP estimates  does not inﬂuence  the point estimate  ̂𝛽. However,  the 
variance  of ̂𝛽is allowed  to increase  with heterogeneity.  Multiplicative  
random-eﬀects  models are also known to be more robust to small sam- 
ple bias. In practice,  these three IVW MR variants  can be used as part of 
a sensitivity  analysis.  Large diﬀerences  in their causal eﬀect estimates  
are a sign of (directional)  pleiotropy  or problematic  heterogeneity.  An 
in-depth  account  of meta-analytic  approaches  for MR can be found in 
Bowden  et al. (2017) . 
Although  it is the most eﬃcient  method  in terms of statistical  power, 
standard  IVW MR is not robust to outliers  and requires  all selected  SNPs 
to be valid instrumental  variables.  In IVW MR, the intercept  is ﬁxed at 
zero (see Fig. 3 B). This follows  directly  from the third IV-assumption  
5 This is analogous  to the two-step  least-squares  (2SLS) approach  for 
individual-level  data, where in the ﬁrst step the exposure  is regressed  on the 
SNPs and in the second step the outcome  is regressed  on the ﬁtted values of the 
exposure.  
6 In detail, this follows from the following  linear relations  ( 𝑋denoting  the 
exposure,  𝑌 the outcome  and 𝑍the SNP): 𝑋 = 𝑍𝛾𝐸 + 𝜖and 𝑌 = 𝑍𝛾𝑂 + 𝜖, leading 
to 𝑌 = 𝑋𝛽+ 𝜖= 𝑍𝛾𝐸 𝛽+ 𝜖, and ﬁnally 𝛾𝑂 = 𝛾𝐸 𝛽. Rearranging  and substituting  
sample estimates  gives ̂𝛽= ̂𝛾𝑂 ∕ ̂𝛾𝐸 . that all selected  SNPs are acting on the outcome  only via the exposure.  
Thus a null association  with the exposure  entails a zero eﬀect on the out- 
come. MR-Egger  regression  ( Bowden  et al., 2015; Burgess  and Thomp-  
son, 2017 ) removes  this constraint,  allowing  the intercept  to vary freely. 
Consequentially,  a non-zero  estimate  for the MR-Egger  intercept  indi- 
cates the presence  of invalid instruments  due to pleiotropy,  and hence 
allows this violation  of the MR assumptions  to be ﬂagged  ( Burgess  et al., 
2020a ). Although  MR-Egger  permits  all instruments  to be aﬀected  by 
pleiotropy,  the so-called  InSIDE (Instrument  Strength  Independent  of 
Direct Eﬀect) assumption  requires  that any pleiotropic  eﬀects are in- 
dependent  of the instrument–exposure  associations.  One of the main 
drawbacks  of the MR-Egger  approach  are its high sensitivity  to outliers  
and its reduced  eﬃciency  (lower power) compared  to IVW MR. 
Many robust MR methods  rely on relaxed  assumptions  for a sub- 
set of instrumental  variables  in a polygenic  analysis  framework.  These 
methods  can usually  deal with some fraction  of invalid instruments  and 
still provide  valid causal inferences.  While problems  such as linkage  
disequilibrium  or systematic  confounding  due to selection  bias can in- 
validate  the analysis,  instrument  invalidity  most often arises from hor- 
izontal pleiotropy.  This violation  of the exclusion  restriction,  horizon-  
tal pleiotropy,  arises when the genetic  variant inﬂuences  the outcome  
via additional  pathways  that do not include  the exposure  (see Fig. 2 D) 
( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). 
Robust methods  generally  allow a certain number  of SNPs to be af- 
fected by pleiotropic  eﬀects under the condition  that the instrumental  
variable  assumptions  hold for the rest of the selected  instruments.  In 
the following  we brieﬂy cover the main characteristics  of the most com- 
monly used MR approaches.  
Among  robust methods,  median-based  ( Bowden  et al., 2016a ) and 
mode-based  ( Hartwig  et al., 2017 ) methods  take a consensus-based  ap- 
proach by assuming  that a majority  (median-based)  or a plurality  (mode- 
based) of instruments  are valid. By using, in eﬀect, only a subset of 
instruments,  these methods  are more robust to outliers  in the single- 
SNP ratio estimates  of the causal eﬀect at the cost of reduced  statistical  
power. 
Another  approach,  MR-PRESSO  ( Verbanck  et al., 2018 ) allows for up 
to half of selected  instruments  to be aﬀected  by horizontal  pleiotropy.  
It seeks to ﬁnd and remove  outliers  based on a heterogeneity  test of 
the single-SNP  eﬀect estimates.  After removal  of genetic  variants  with 
substantially  diﬀerent  eﬀect estimates,  a standard  IVW MR analysis  is 
performed.  The reason for demanding  all instruments  to give similar 
eﬀect estimates  is that this should reﬂect the same causal eﬀect of the 
exposure  on the outcome,  regardless  of the choice of IV and the strength  
of the IV’s causality  onto exposure  and outcome.  
In scenarios  where several,  closely related exposures  are candidate  
causes for the same outcome,  genetic  variants  that are selected  as in- 
strumental  variables  may be associated  with some or all related expo- 
sures. This means that it may not be possible  to ﬁnd a set of instruments  
that is speciﬁc  to one exposure  without  exhibiting  pleiotropic  eﬀects 
via related exposures.  Multivariable  MR (MVMR)  approaches  ( Burgess  
and Thompson,  2015b; Sanderson  et al., 2019 ) try to address  this by in- 
cluding  multiple  exposures  in the analysis.  The standard  IV assumptions  
must still hold, with the set of exposures  replacing  the single exposure  
in univariable  MR. Conceptually,  multivariable  MR is an extension  of 
the IVW method  and estimates  a causal eﬀect while controlling  for a 
number  of other, measured  biological  pathways.  
Overall,  MR methods  development  is an active area of research  and 
many novel or modiﬁed  analysis  approaches  have been proposed  in re- 
cent months  and years. A full account  is beyond  the scope of this pa- 
per, however,  many newer methods  fall into one of two broad cate- 
gories: i) regression  models (e.g., MR-Lasso  ( Slob and Burgess,  2020 ), 
radial regression  ( Bowden  et al., 2018 ), and ii) likelihood-based  models 
(e.g., MR-Mix  ( Qi and Chatterjee,  2019 ), MR-RAPS  ( Zhao et al., 2020 ), 
BayesMR  ( Bucur et al., 2020 ), contamination  mixture  ( Burgess  et al., 
2020b ), CAUSE ( Morrison  et al., 2020 ), GRAPPLE  ( Wang et al., 
2020 )).

For an extensive  overview  of standard  and robust MR methods  and 
best practice  approaches,  we highly recommend  recently  published  
guidelines  ( Burgess  et al., 2020a; Davey Smith et al., 2019; Sander-  
son et al., 2022 ), method  comparisons  ( Slob and Burgess,  2020 ) and 
the STROBE-MR  guidelines  on reporting  MR results ( Skrivankova  et al., 
2021 ). 
2.1.5. Sensitivity  analysis  of MR results 
Recent reviews  and guidelines  ( Burgess  et al., 2020a; Davey Smith 
et al., 2019 ) strongly  advocate  for the inclusion  of sensitivity  analyses  
as a core part of any Mendelian  randomisation  investigation.  
The main approach  to assess the robustness  of ﬁndings  from MR 
analyses  is to obtain several estimates  from diﬀerent  MR variants,  in- 
cluding  standard  mean and median  based methods,  MR-Egger  regres- 
sion, methods  sensitive  to outliers  such as MR-PRESSO,  multivariable  
MR, and any other approach  that may be suitable  for the particular  
data at hand. An additional,  straightforward  assessment  can be done by varying  the selection  of instruments  via a more (or less) stringent  
p-value  threshold  for the SNP–exposure  association.  Consistency  of re- 
sults from diﬀerent  sets of genetic  instruments  with fewer but stronger  
(or more but weaker)  instruments  will generally  indicate  a robust causal 
eﬀect. 
A similar approach  is to look for heterogeneity  in eﬀect estimates  
as a result of removing  a single instrument  or a subset of instruments  
from the analysis.  Leave-one-out  and SNP-subset  analyses  can help iden- 
tify variants  that are predominantly  driving  the causal eﬀect estimate.  
In cases where a bi-directional  causal pathway  may exist between  ex- 
posure and outcome  or when the direction  of the causal eﬀect is part 
of the research  question,  Steiger ﬁltering  ( Hemani  et al., 2017 ) can be 
used to remove  potentially  invalid genetic  variants  under the assump-  
tion that the SNP–exposure  association  is expected  to be stronger  than 
the SNP–outcome  association.  However,  Steiger ﬁltering  is sensitive  to 
measurement  errors and may lead to the removal  of valid instruments,  
especially  in two-sample  MR analyses.  
5  B. Taschler, S.M. Smith and T.E. Nichols NeuroImage  258 (2022) 119385 
Further  recommended  is the inclusion  of heterogeneity  measures  
such as Cochran’s  𝑄 statistic  or the 𝐼 2 statistic  7 in polygenic  MR anal- 
yses ( Bowden  et al., 2016b ). Substantial  heterogeneity  in SNP-speciﬁc  
causal eﬀect estimates  and clear outliers  can indicate  the presence  of 
horizontal  pleiotropic  eﬀects. On the other hand, largely homogeneous  
eﬀect estimates  provide  the basis for more reliable  causal conclusions  
( Burgess  et al., 2020a ). 
Various  graphical  tools can be used to gain qualitative  information  
about potential  outliers  and unexpectedly  skewed  or otherwise  biased 
eﬀect estimates.  These include  scatter plots of the SNP associations  with 
exposure  and outcome,  funnel plots of single-SNP  eﬀect estimates  and 
forest plots of leave-one-out  analyses  (see, e.g., Figs. 5 , 13). 
When prior knowledge  about causal relationships  involving  the ex- 
posure and outcome  variables  is available,  a positive  outcome  or neg- 
ative outcome  analysis  can help establish  the validity  of chosen instru- 
mental variables  ( Sanderson  et al., 2021a ). For example,  using a positive  
control outcome  and given a large enough  sample size, SNPs that do not 
yield an eﬀect similar to what has already  been established  may be too 
weak or invalid for the exposure  in question  and are unlikely  to produce  
correct eﬀect estimates  when used with the outcome  of interest.  
A summary  of suggested  steps and procedures  to be considered  when 
performing  an MR analysis  is provided  in Table 1 . 
2.1.6. Interpretation  of results 
Depending  on the nature of the investigation,  a distinction  can be 
made whether  the presence  of a causal eﬀect and its direction  (testing  
the causal null hypothesis)  is of primary  interest  or whether  the goal is 
an estimation  of the eﬀect size. Scenarios  in which the expected  eﬀects 
of an intervention  (e.g., drug treatment  or medical  procedure)  on the 
exposure  are scrutinised  are mostly concerned  with eﬀect size, whereas  
questions  of disease  aetiology  or fundamental  biological  mechanisms  
focus predominantly  on causal direction  detection.  
In addition  to the three core IV assumptions  discussed  in 
Section  2.1.1 , an additional  monotonicity  or homogeneity  assumption  
needs to hold for a causal interpretation  of the MR eﬀect estimate.  Mono- 
tonicity  refers to the relationship  between  genetic  instruments  and expo- 
sure. It assumes  that the SNPs could not increase  the level of exposure  
in some individuals  and decrease  the level of exposure  in others. Ho- 
mogeneity  is a slightly  stronger  assumption  in that it requires  that the 
eﬀect of the SNPs on the exposure  (or the eﬀect of the exposure  on the 
outcome)  is the same for all individuals.  If any of these two assumptions  
hold then the MR estimate  is consistent  with the average  causal eﬀect 
for the population  under study ( Burgess  and Thompson,  2017; Swanson  
et al., 2018 ). 
In the context  of Mendelian  randomisation,  the causal eﬀect of the 
risk factor on the outcome  is commonly  interpreted  as the consequence  
of a lifetime  exposure  to a genetically  determined  level of the risk fac- 
tor. The impact as well as the biological  pathways  through  which the 
risk factor inﬂuences  the outcome  may be diﬀerent  in case of a direct 
intervention.  Under valid instrumental  variable  assumptions,  an MR es- 
timate can be regarded  as the causal eﬀect when determining  someone’s  
genotype  at conception.  For the purposes  of modiﬁcation  and interven-  
tion in clinical  settings,  additionally  an equivalence  between  gene and 
environment  eﬀects needs to hold. 
This is further complicated  when time-varying  exposures  are consid-  
ered. In these cases the estimated  eﬀect from MR should be interpreted  
as the eﬀect of changing  the (genotypic)  liability  that causes the expo- 
sure as a function  of time ( Morris et al., 2021 ). Recommendations  from 
methodological  researchers  strongly  advise against  a simplistic  interpre-  
tation of eﬀect estimates  and emphasise  the perspective  that MR should 
be used to test the causal null hypothesis  rather than to estimate  eﬀect 
magnitudes  ( Burgess  et al., 2020a; 2021; Vanderweele  et al., 2014 ). 
7 Higgins’  𝐼 2 is deﬁned in relation to Cochran’s  𝑄 as 𝐼 2 = 𝑄 − ( 𝐿 − 1)∕ 𝑄 , 
where 𝐿 denotes the number of SNPs. It can be used to assess regression  di- 
lution and expected  bias (towards  null) of the MR-Egger  estimate.  2.1.7. Limitations  
Apart from limitations  inherent  in the modelling  assumptions  under- 
pinning  Mendelian  randomisation,  there are issues that can arise from 
the data itself, e.g., from the way data are collected  and processed  or in 
terms of sample size and composition.  
Focusing  on UK Biobank,  several recent papers have reported  ﬁnd- 
ings that demonstrate  non-random  patterns  in the data. For example,  
Haworth  et al. (2019) have identiﬁed  a geographical  structure  in UKB 
genotype  data. A coincidence  of health outcomes  and genetic  variants  
with birth location  can introduce  biased associations  and potentially  
invalidate  modelling  assumptions.  Other studies have shown that popu- 
lation structure  ( Lawson  et al., 2020 ) and selection  bias ( Munafòet  al., 
2018 ) may play a non-negligible  role in the composition  of UKB sam- 
ples, and that genotypic  information  can predict participation  in some 
components  of the UKB assessments  ( Tyrrell et al., 2021 ). 
Many bias issues can be seen as diﬀerent  versions  of selection  bias 
(in the causal literature  commonly  referred  to as collider  bias), where 
two or more variables  inﬂuence  whether  someone  is selected  for or takes 
part in a data collection  study. In statistical  terms, this means that selec- 
tion into the sample is conditional  on a common  cause of the variables  
in question,  thereby  introducing  a spurious  association  between  these 
variables  (see Fig. 2 G–I for a graphical  representation).  Selection  and 
other biases, most notably  pleiotropy  in the case of MR, are discussed  
in Section  2.4 .",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9391, 9396), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(33500, 33506), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118994,"2.1. State-of-the-art  approaches  to noise-robust  EEG processing  
Existing  strategies  for dealing  with noisy data can be divided  into 
three categories  ( Table 1 ): (1) ignoring  or rejecting  noisy segments,  
(2) implicit  denoising,  i.e. , methods  that allow models to work despite 
noise, and (3) explicit  denoising,  i.e. , methods  that rely on a separate  
preprocessing  step to handle noise or missing  channels  before predic- 
tion. We now discuss existing  methods  employing  these strategies  in 
more detail. 
The simplest  way to deal with noise in EEG is to assume  that it is 
negligible  or to simply discard  bad segments  ( Roy et al., 2019 ). For 
instance,  a manually  selected  amplitude  or variance  threshold  ( Hefron 
et al., 2018; Manor and Geva, 2015; Wang et al., 2018 ) or a classiﬁer  
trained  to recognize  artifacts  ( Dhindsa,  2017 ) can be used to identify  
segments  to be ignored.  This approach,  though commonplace,  is ill- 
suited to mobile EEG settings  where noise cannot be assumed  to be neg- 
ligible, but also to online applications  where model predictions  need to 
be continuously  available.  Moreover,  this approach  is likely to discard  
windows  due to a small fraction  of bad electrodes,  potentially  losing 
usable information  from other channels.  
Implicit  denoising  approaches  can be used to design noise-robust  
processing  pipelines  that do not contain  a speciﬁc  noise handling  step. 
First, implicit  denoising  approaches  can use representations  of EEG data 
that are robust to missing  channels.  For instance,  multichannel  EEG can 
be transformed  into topographical  maps ( “topomaps  ”) that are less sen- 
2  H. Banville, S.U.N. Wood, C. Aimone et al. NeuroImage  251 (2022) 118994 
sitive to the absence  of a few channels.  This representation  is then typ- 
ically fed into a standard  convolutional  neural network  (ConvNet)  ar- 
chitecture.  While this approach  can gracefully  handle missing  channels  
in dense montages  ( e.g., 16 to 64 channels  in Bashivan  et al., 2015; Ha- 
gad et al., 2019; Thodoroﬀ et  al., 2016 ), it is likely to perform  poorly 
on sparse montages  ( e.g., 4 channels)  as spatial interpolation  might 
fail if channels  are missing.  Moreover,  this approach  requires  compu-  
tationally  demanding  preprocessing  and feature extraction  steps, un- 
desirable  in online and low-computational  resources  contexts.  In the 
traditional  machine  learning  setting,  Sabbagh  et al. (2020) showed  
that representing  input windows  as covariance  matrices  and using Rie- 
mannian  geometry-aware  models did not require  common  noise cor- 
rection steps to reach high performance  on a brain age prediction  
task. However,  the robustness  of this approach  has not been evalu- 
ated on sparse montages.  Also, its integration  into neural network  ar- 
chitectures  is not straightforward  with geometry-aware  deep learning  
remaining  an active ﬁeld of research  ( Bronstein  et al., 2017 ). Signal 
processing  techniques  can also be used to promote  invariance  to cer- 
tain types of noise. For instance,  the Lomb-Scargle  periodogram  can be 
used to extract spectral  representations  that are robust to missing  sam- 
ples ( Chu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015 ). However,  this approach  fails 
when channels  are completely  missing.  Finally,  implicit  denoising  can 
be achieved  with traditional  machine  learning  models that are inher- 
ently robust to noise. For instance,  random  forests trained  on hand- 
crafted EEG features  were shown to be notably  more robust to low 
SNR inputs than univariate  models on a state-of-consciousness  predic- 
tion task ( Engemann  et al., 2018 ). Although  promising,  this approach  is 
limited by its feature engineering  step, as features  (1) rely heavily  on do- 
main knowledge,  (2) might not be optimal  to the task, and (3) require  an 
additional  processing  step which can be prohibitive  in limited resource  
contexts.  
Multiple  studies have explicitly  handled  noise by correcting  cor- 
rupted signals or predicting  missing  or additional  channels  from avail- 
able ones. Spatial projection  approaches  aim at projecting  the input 
signals to a noise-free  subspace  before projecting  the signals back into 
channel-space,  e.g., using independent  component  analysis  (ICA) ( Jung 
et al., 1998; Mammone  et al., 2011; Winkler  et al., 2011 ) or princi- 
pal components  analysis  (PCA) ( Kothe and Jung, 2016; Uusitalo  and 
Ilmoniemi,  1997 ). While approaches  such as ICA are powerful  tools 
to mitigate  artifact  and noise components  in a semi-automated  way, 
their eﬃcacy  can diminish  when only few channels  are available.  For 
instance,  in addition  to introducing  an additional  preprocessing  step, 
these approaches  are likely to discard  important  discriminative  informa-  
tion during preprocessing  because  they are decoupled  from the predic- 
tion task. Also, the fact that preprocessing  is done independently  from 
the supervised  learning  task, or the statistical  testing procedure,  actu- 
ally makes the selection  of preprocessing  parameters  ( e.g., number  of 
good components)  challenging.  Motivated  by the challenge  of parame-  
ter selection,  fully automated  denoising  pipelines  have been proposed.  
FASTER  ( Nolan et al., 2010 ) and PREP ( Bigdely-Shamlo  et al., 2015 ) 
both combine  artifact  correction,  noise removal  and bad channel  inter- 
polation  into a single automated  pipeline.  Autoreject  ( Jas et al., 2017 ) 
is another  recently  developed  pipeline  that uses cross-validation  to au- 
tomatically  select amplitude  thresholds  to use for rejecting  windows  or 
ﬂagging  bad channels.  These approaches  are well-suited  to oﬄine anal- 
yses where the morphology  of the signals is of interest,  however  they are 
typically  computationally  demanding  and are also decoupled  from the 
statistical  modeling.  Additionally,  it is unclear  how interpolation  can be 
applied  when using bipolar  montages  ( i.e. , that do not share a single 
reference),  as is often the case in e.g., polysomnography  ( Berry et al., 
2012 ) and epilepsy  monitoring  ( Rosenzweig  et al., 2014 ). 
Finally,  generic  machine  learning  models have been proposed  to 
recover  bad channels.  For instance,  generative  adversarial  networks  
(GANs)  have been trained  to recover  dense EEG montages  from a few 
electrodes  ( Corley and Huang,  2018; Svantesson  et al., 2020 ). Other sim- 
ilar methods  have been proposed,  e.g., long short-term  memory  (LSTM)  neural networks  ( Paul, 2020 ), autoencoders  ( El-Fiqi et al., 2019 ), or ten- 
sor decomposition  and compressed  sensing  ( Ramakrishnan  and Satya- 
narayana,  2016; Sole-Casals  et al., 2018 ). However,  these methods  pos- 
tulate that the identity  of bad channels  is known ahead of time, which 
is a non-trivial  assumption  in practice.  
In contrast  to the existing  literature  on channel  corruption  handling  
in EEG, we introduce  an interpretable  end-to-end  denoising  approach  
that can learn implicitly  to work with corrupted  sparse EEG data, and 
that does not require  additional  preprocessing  steps.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11260, 11265), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(7303, 7309), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119441,"Introduction  
The inferior  parietal  cortex (IPC) has long been reported  to be in- 
volved in action-related  functions  ( Keysers  and Gazzola,  2009 ; Caspers  
et al., 2010), detection  of visual target and novelty  ( Gur et al., 2007 ), 
ﬂexible  reconﬁguration  of behavior  ( Singh-Curry  and Husain,  2009 ) and 
in particular  in cognitive  control of language  which engages  parts of the 
cortex involved  in general  aspects  of cognitive  control ( Abutalebi  and 
Green, 2007 , 2008; Branzi et al., 2016 ). The IPC is in fact considered  part 
of the language  control network  ( Fabbro et al., 2000 ; Green and Abu- 
talebi, 2013 ) that supports  language  control functions  such as resolving  
competition  between  languages  ( Reverberi  et al., 2015 ) and switching  
between  languages  ( Abutalebi  and Green, 2008 ; Kroll et al., 2006 ). 
Based on the structural  parcellation  of the human IPC, this part of the 
cortex consists  of three clusters,  namely  the rostral, the middle and the 
caudal ( Caspers  et al., 2013 ). The white matter connectivity  of the IPC 
as well as the functional  diﬀerentiations  of this part of the cortex also 
point to the IPC’s cytoarchitectonically  diﬀerent  areas ( Caspers  et al., 
2013 ; Corbetta  et al., 2008 ; Keysers  and Gazzola,  2009 ). Regarding  
the ﬁber tracks between  the IPC clusters  and other parts of the cortex, 
Caspers  et al. (2011) reported  that the IPC rostral cluster has connections  
with the somatosensory  areas, motor and premotor  cortex as well as with 
∗ Corresponding  author. the inferior  frontal cortex. The IPC caudal cluster is connected  with the 
temporal  and the higher visual areas in addition  to the posterior  parietal  
cortex. The IPC middle cluster,  however,  has strong connections  with the 
superior  parietal  cortex, the intraparietal  areas and with the frontal cor- 
tex, demonstrating  similarities  in white matter connectivity  with both 
those of the rostral and the caudal IPC. Having  said that, in delineating  
the contribution  of the IPC to diﬀerent  cognitive  functions,  in particular  
to cognitive  control including  response  selection  ( Branzi et al., 2016 ) up- 
dating, shifting  and inhibition  ( Abutalebi  and Green, 2008 ; Wager et al., 
2004 ), attention  ( Corbetta  et al., 2008 ; Tomasi  and Volkow,  2011 ) and 
memory  ( Martinelli  et al., 2013 ), in the literature  the IPC is considered  
as a whole, regardless  of its tripartite  organization  into the rostral, the 
middle and the caudal clusters.  In other words, in reporting  the involve-  
ment of the IPC in cognitive  control and the importance  of this part of 
the cortex in frontoparietal  network  (for a review see Dajani and Ud- 
din, 2015 ), the literature  has ignored  the fact that every part of the 
tripartite  section of the IPC has some functional  characteristics  related 
to its structural  organization  and depending  on the type of task, the 
rostral, the middle and the caudal IPC can have diﬀerent  functional  as- 
sociations  with other parts of the brain. Thus, it is possible  that it is not 
the whole IPC that contributes  to cognitive  control but one or two parts

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119171,"Introduction  
Autism Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD) is a life-long  neurodevelopmen-  
tal disorder  which aﬀects more than 1% of the population.  Its sever- 
ity diﬀers vastly amongst  individuals,  however,  they all share per- 
sistent deﬁcits  in social communication  and restricted,  repetitive  and 
stereotyped  behaviours.  ASD is heritable,  and inﬂuenced  by common  
genetic  variation  as well as rare mutations  ( Krumm  et al., 2015 ; 
Bourgeron,  2015 ; Sandin et al., 2017 ; Weiner  et al., 2017 ). Early in- 
tervention  has a signiﬁcant  positive  impact on the patient’s  outcome,  
which makes early diagnosis  a research  priority  ( Dawson  et al., 2010 ). 
Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) is an important  tool to explore  
the brain of individuals  with ASD: it is a widely available,  fast, and non- 
invasive  method  to measure  brain anatomy  and function.  By providing  
detailed  measurements  of an individual’s  brain, MRI brings the promises  
of precision  psychiatry,  adapting  therapy  to patients  ( Insel, 2014 ). But 
can MRI be used to characterise  ASD in general?  For more than 30 years, 
MRI studies have described  anatomical  and functional  diﬀerences  be- 
tween individuals  with ASD and unaﬀected  controls:  enlarged  brain vol- 
ume and cortical  surface area ( Piven et al., 1995 ; E. Courchesne  et al., 
2001 ), decreases  in brain volume  and neocortical  thinning  during ado- 
lescence  and adulthood  ( Lange et al., 2015 ; Zielinski  et al., 2014 ), 
smaller  corpus callosum  ( Egaas et al., 1995 ; Wolﬀ et  al., 2015 ), ab- 
normal  cerebellar  volume  ( Courchesne,  1987 ; Hodge et al., 2010 ; 
Fatemi et al., 2012 ), and global and regional  increases  and decreases  in 
functional  connectivity  ( Just, 2004 ; Belmonte,  2004 ; Di Martino  et al., 
2014a ; Cheng et al., 2017 ). 
Many of these ﬁndings  are, however,  controversial  and have proven 
diﬃcult  to replicate  ( Haar et al., 2016 ; Lefebvre  et al., 2015 ; Traut et al., 
2018 ; Picci et al., 2016 ; Mohammad-Rezazadeh  et al., 2016 ). Most stud- 
ies have relied on sample sizes far too small to reach reliable  conclusions  
–sometimes  just a few dozen subjects,  and up to a few hundreds  at most. 
They lack replication  and reanalysis  on independent  data. This is par- 
ticularly  problematic  because  of the multitude  of parameters  involved  
in each analysis  which could substantially  alter the results ( Carp, 2012 ; 
Power et al., 2012 ; Poldrack  et al., 2017 ): acquisition  sequence,  subject 
motion,  software  packages,  pre-processing  workﬂow,  etc. 
Rather than focusing  on the detection  of speciﬁc  regional  diﬀerences  
between  cases and controls,  brain-imaging  features  can be combined  
into a biomarker  of ASD answering  the question:  can diagnostic  status 
be inferred  from MRI data? Machine-learning  provides  important  tech- 
niques to build and characterise  such biomarkers.  Yet, machine-learning  
studies of ASD are most often based on the analysis  of a single sample,  
without  validation  of the ﬁndings  in an independent  sample.  The com- 
munity  recognises  today that establishing  the validity  of a biomarker  
needs a fully independent  assessment  on new data, otherwise  its accu- 
racy cannot be trusted ( Woo et al., 2017 ; Poldrack  et al., 2019 ) as it 
may arise from overﬁtting,  circular  analysis  ( Kriegeskorte  et al., 2009 ) 
or researchers’  degrees  of freedom  ( Ioannidis,  2005 ). This is particularly  
critical for machine  learning  approaches,  where classiﬁers  trained  on 
data from one sample may be unable to generalise  to additional  samples  
( Ecker et al., 2015 ). Publication  incentives  lead researchers  to seek and 
report the best prediction  accuracy.  For brain-imaging  biomarkers  of 
ASD, publications  have reported  accuracies  above 95% ( Bi et al., 2018 ). 
If that were true, the accuracy  of those algorithms  would be equiva-  
lent to the inter-rater  reliability  of clinical  assessment  by human experts  
(kappa = 95%) which deﬁnes the gold-standard  for discrimination  of ASD 
versus other development  disorders  ( Klin et al., 2000 ). But how trust- 
worthy  is the evaluation  of biomarkers  such as those in ( Bi et al., 2018 ), 
given that the whole study –biomarker  extraction  and validation  –was 
done on only 50 ASD patients  and 42 non-ASD  controls?  Peer-review  is not suﬃcient  to assess the analytic  choices  as even minor variants  lead 
to large diﬀerences  in observed  prediction  accuracy,  though these are 
unlikely  to reveal true improvements  ( Varoquaux,  2018 ). 
To ground  solid conclusions  on ASD neuroimaging,  several interna-  
tional consortia  have been constituted  such as ABIDE (Autism  Brain 
Imaging  Data Exchange,  Di Martino  et al., 2014b ; Di Martino  et al., 
2017 ), EU-AIMS  (European  Autism Interventions  - A Multicentre  Study 
for Developing  New Medications,  Murphy  and Spooren,  2012 ) or the 
IBIS Network  (Infant Brain Imaging  Study, Hazlett  et al., 2012 ), in- 
creasing  sample sizes through  data sharing.  They extend the amount  
and quality of the data collected  through  harmonisation  eﬀorts. Recent 
analysis  across cohorts  has shown that ASD is signiﬁcantly  associated  
with changes  in functional  connectivity  ( Holiga et al., 2019 ). But are 
these changes  large enough  to ground  reliable  prediction  to new sites, 
despite heterogeneity  in imaging  techniques  and populations  recruited?  
The study we present  built upon these large cohorts,  and framed the 
extraction  of biomarkers  as an open, international  challenge  to predict 
ASD from the largest MRI dataset currently  available  –more than 2000 
individuals.  A data-science  prediction  challenge  of this type can provide  
conclusive  evidence  on the ability of MRI to detect ASD, because  it is 
based on a blind evaluation  of the results in addition  to relying on a large 
sample.  Furthermore,  it isolates  the development  of the analysis  pipeline  
from its evaluation.  Challengers  did not have access to validation  data, 
which allowed  us to test the ability of the algorithms  to generalise  to 
unseen data, including  data acquired  in diﬀerent  centres.  
Materials  and methods  
Brain imaging  dataset 
The brain imaging  dataset combined  data from the public Autism 
Brain Imaging  Data Exchange  (ABIDE)  I and II datasets  ( Di Martino  
et al., 2014a ; Di Martino  et al., 2017 ) and an unpublished  dataset from 
the Robert DebréHospital  (RDB) in Paris, France (see Supplemental  Ta- 
ble 1 for additional  demographic  information  for the RDB site). ABIDE 
provides  open access to functional  and anatomical  MRI data for 2156 
subjects.  The RDB dataset contained  data from 247 subjects,  56 of whom 
were also part of the ABIDE II project:  we excluded  these duplicate  sub- 
jects from the private dataset.  With the exception  of data coming  from 
the RDB centre which was acquired  in a 1.5 Tesla scanner,  all MRI data 
was acquired  in 3 Tesla scanners.  In all sites subjects  were diagnosed  us- 
ing standard  ADI/ADOS  tools to support  clinical  assessment.  Most sub- 
jects had a full IQ > 75. 
We extracted  anatomical  features  from the anatomical  MRI: regional  
brain volumes,  cortical  thickness,  and surface area; and extracted  time- 
series signals from the resting-state  functional  MRI. To derive these in- 
dividual  measurements,  the data were processed  with standard  neu- 
roimaging  tools: Freesurfer  ( Fischl et al., 1999 ), FSL ( Woolrich  et al., 
2009 ), and AFNI ( Cox, 1996 ). We split the total dataset into public 
and private datasets,  aiming at balancing  the age and sex distributions  
( Table 1 and Fig. 1 provide  demographic  information  for the public and 
private datasets).  A total of 2117 subjects  were included:  947 ASD and 
1170 controls.  We did not exclude  subjects  based on quality control,  but 
provided  challengers  with quality control scores obtained  from visual 
inspection  by 3 experts.  The public dataset contained  data from 1150 
subjects:  549 ASD and 601 controls.  The private dataset contained  data 
from 967 subjects:  398 ASD and 569 controls.  The public dataset was a 
subset of ABIDE I and II, while the private dataset combined  data from 
ABIDE I, II and RDB. The dataset should capture  well the clinical  and 
methodological  heterogeneity  of ASD neuroimaging.  The ABIDE dataset 
2  N. Traut, K. Heuer, G. Lemaître et al. NeuroImage  255 (2022) 119171 
was collected  by 24 diﬀerent  centres worldwide,  and spans an age range 
from 5 to 64 years old (median  13.8 years old). All subjects  had intellec-  
tual quotients  within the normal  range (97% have full IQ > 80), 80% of 
patients  and 90% of controls  were right-handed.  The cohort was com- 
posed of 80% males. 
This diversity  should allow classiﬁcation  algorithms  to generalise,  
preventing  them from specialising  in a particular  type of data or age 
range. Further  demographic  information  for the ABIDE I and II datasets  
is provided  in their corresponding  publications  ( Di Martino  et al., 2014a ; 
Di Martino  et al., 2017 ). 
Study design: a data-science  prediction  challenge  
Description  of the challenge:  We launched  the challenge  inviting  
data scientists  to submit algorithms  to predict ASD diagnostic  from pro- 
vided MRI data. The challenge  lasted 3 months  and attracted  146 chal- 
lengers.  We awarded  money prizes to the 10 best challengers.  These 
were determined  after the closure  of the competition,  by assessing  how 
well the algorithms  would predict ASD diagnostic  in a private,  unseen 
dataset.  
The ABIDE data can be openly distributed,  which enabled  us to pro- 
vide a rich dataset on which challengers  could tune their algorithms.  To 
facilitate  access to the data, we provided  challengers  with a “starting  
kit ” giving  a proof-of-concept  predictive  model on the data (extracted  
on standard  brain atlases).  Challengers  were then able to develop  their 
own prediction  algorithms,  which they submitted  using a Web interface.  
The code was executed  on our central server. The challengers  never had 
access to the private dataset.  They used machine-learning  techniques  
tuned on the public dataset and submitted  the corresponding  code to 
the central server which evaluated  them in the private dataset.  
To measure  the quality of the predictions,  we used a standard  met- 
ric: the area under the receiver  operating  characteristic  curve (ROC- 
AUC). This measure  summarises  various  detection  tradeoﬀs,  for exam- 
ple, favouring  few false negatives  to the cost of false positives  in the case 
of a screening  study, or the converse,  in the case of a conﬁrmatory  study. 
Prediction  at chance level gives an AUC of 0.5, while perfect prediction  
gives an AUC of 1. 
Statististical  analysis  strategy:  After the closure  of the challenge,  
we analysed  the 10 best submissions  to understand  the factors driv- 
ing their predictions.  Considering  that these machine-learning  algo- 
rithms captured  the best possible  predictive  biomarkers  given our brain- 
imaging  cohort, we varied the data on which they were applied.  Each 
time, we ﬁt the algorithms  anew on the data, to extract the correspond-  
ing biomarkers,  and measured  the prediction  accuracy  on the private 
dataset.  First, we applied  them to diﬀerent  imaging  modalities:  only 
functional  MRI, or only anatomical  MRI. Second,  we varied the num- 
ber of available  subjects,  to measure  the importance  of the sample size. 
Finally,  we investigated  the importance  of diﬀerent  brain regions  by re- 
moving  those that appeared  as most discriminative  and attempting  to 
extract biomarkers  from the rest of the data. To compute  which regions  
were the most discriminative,  we used the absolute  value of the model’s  
coeﬃcients  when the algorithm  used a linear model, and the feature 
importance  when the algorithm  used a random  forest. We obtained  a 
region-level  summary  of functional-connectivity  biomarkers  by associ- 
ating to every region the sum of the importance  of its connections,  a 
measure  of node strength.  Region-level  importance  was then turned into 
a brain map characterising  the spatial distribution  of the discriminant  
information.  
MRI preprocessing  and signal extraction  
Anatomical  MRI: Anatomical  MRI was preprocessed  and segmented  
using FreeSurfer  v6.0. We extracted  three kinds of anatomical  features:  
(i) mean regional  cortical  thickness,  (ii) cortical  surface area of regions  
parcellated  with the Desikan-Killiany  Atlas ( Desikan  et al., 2006 ), and 
Fig. 1. Subjects,  sex, age, and site distributions.  The distributions  of the number 
of cases and controls,  their sex ratio, age and scanning  site were similar in the 
public and private datasets.  
(iii) volumes  of subcortical  regions  segmented  with the FreeSurfer  atlas 
( Fischl et al., 2002 ). 
Resting-state  functional  MRI: Resting-state  functional  MRI captures  
brain activity  and functional  connectivity.  It is typically  studied  via a 
functional-connectome:  a matrix capturing  interactions  between  brain 
regions.  We provided  time series extracted  on a variety of atlases after 
standard  fMRI preprocessing  using the pipeline  from the FC1000  project 
(which includes  slice-time  interpolation,  motion correction,  coregistra-  
tion to anatomical  data, normalisation  to template  space). The brain 
parcellations  and atlases used were: (i) BASC parcellations  with 64, 
122, and 197 regions  ( Bellec et al., 2010 ); (ii) Ncuts parcellations  
( Craddock  et al., 2012 ); (iii) Harvard-Oxford  anatomical  parcellations;  
(iv) MSDL functional  atlas ( Varoquaux  et al., 2011 ); and (v) Power atlas 
( Power et al., 2011 ). 
Challenge  organisation  
Organisation  of the challenge:  We launched  the challenge  on May 
1st 2018 and closed it on July 1st 2018. The challenge  attracted  about 
146 participants  accounting  for a total of about 720 submissions.  We 
awarded  money prizes to the 10 best challengers.  Challengers  were 
ranked based on the ROC-AUC  score of their submission  computed  on 
the private dataset.  We framed the challenge  problem  by providing:  (i)

a public dataset,  (ii) a standard  way to assess the submission,  and (iii) a 
starting  kit. For this purpose,  we used the RAMP (Rapid Analytics  and 
Model Prototyping)  workbench.  Participants  submitted  their solutions  
on the RAMP website  ( https://ramp.studio  ). During the challenge  we 
provided  to the participants  the cross-validated  score computed  on the 
public dataset.  At the end of the challenge,  we asked each participant  
to select a single submission.  This submission  was trained  (ﬁtted) on 
the public dataset and evaluated  on the private dataset hidden from the 
participants.  Participants  were ranked based on the score of these sub- 
missions  computed  on the private dataset.  
Challenge  platform:  RAMP is an online data science  tool used to 
organise  challenges.  RAMP enables  us to easily compare  and reproduce  
predictive  experiments.  It can be used on the user’s computer  or online: 
the former is for developing  predictive  models while the latter assesses  
their predictive  accuracy.  A RAMP “starting  kit ”is a placeholder  where 
we deﬁne the data-science  problem:  we provide  the datasets,  the met- 
ric, and the model validation  technique.  Participants  can focus on the 
development  of their machine-learning  predictive  model. We also pro- 
vide examples  to help participants  understand  the challenge.  The RAMP 
website  was used to evaluate  the solutions  of the participants  (i.e., pre- 
dictive models):  participants  submit their code and the website  trains 
(ﬁts) and evaluates  them. We deployed,  trained,  and tested the full work- 
ﬂow on Amazon  Web Services.  Note that participants  can also train and 
test their models locally.  However,  they only have access to the public 
dataset to test their models.  We rely on Python and its rich ecosystem.  
Participants  were free to use any Python library to build their machine  
learning  model. 
Data and code availability:  The public data, the code of the 
ten best submissions,  the MRI preprocessing  scripts and the scripts 
used to generate  the ﬁgures are available  at https://github.com/neuroa

Results  
Participation  to the challenge  
We received  589 submissions  from 61 teams. To assess external  va- 
lidity of the biomarkers  ( Steyerberg  and Harrell,  2016 ), the private 
dataset contained  > 200 subjects  not included  in ABIDE from the Robert 
DebréHospital  in Paris, France (RDB). We selected  the 10 submissions  
which performed  the best (taking  only one submission  per team) as the 
winning  ones, and gave money prizes to the submitters.  After close in- 
spection  we discovered  that we forgot to remove  56 subjects  of the RDB 
dataset which were also in the ABIDE dataset.  For the post-hoc  analyses  
presented  here, we removed  those duplicated  subjects  from the private 
dataset to avoid artiﬁcially  inﬂating  the prediction  score. The ranking  
between  the 10 best submissions  remained  relatively  stable after the re- 
moval of the duplicate  subjects  (Spearman  correlation:  rs = 0.7697,  p 
(2-tailed)  = 0.00922)  (see Supplemental  Table 2 for a detail of the per- 
formance  of each submission  before and after the removal  of duplicated  
subjects).  The combination  of the 10 best models provided  a good predictor  of ASD 
diagnosis  
We combined  the 10 best models using a blending  approach  
( Caruana  et al., 2004 ) to produce  a probability  for ASD diagnosis  for 
each individual.  These probabilities  were in general  higher for patients  
than for controls  ( Fig. 2 a). The receiver  operating  curve (ROC, Fig. 2 b, 
Supplemental  Methods  M1) represents  the quality of these predictions  
for diﬀerent  tradeoﬀs  of sensitivity  and speciﬁcity,  which can be sum- 
marised  by the area under the curve (AUC). The combined  predictor  
reached  an AUC of 0.80, which is considered  as a good discrimination  
level ( Hosmer  and Lemeshow,  2000 ). Used as a screening  test, the pre- 
dictor would correctly  detect 88% of the individuals  with ASD at the 
cost of misclassifying  50% of controls  as patients.  Used as a conﬁrma-  
tory diagnostic  test, the predictor  would detect 25% of the individuals  
with ASD and only 3% of controls  would be misclassiﬁed  as patients.  
Predictions  were also good (even slightly  better) on the RDB subjects  
which were absent from the ABIDE dataset (median  AUC = 0.809 versus 
AUC = 0.768 –Fig. 2 d). 
After the challenge,  we used an additional  dataset from the EU-AIMS  
project to evaluate  the ability of the blended  predictor  to generalise.  
Performance  on this additional  data was slightly  worse than on our ex- 
ternal site (AUC = 0.721),  revealing  that the predictor  was still fragile 
to distribution  shifts despite having been extracted  from multiple  sites. 
Demographic  information  for this dataset can be found in Table 1 ; the 
most pronounced  diﬀerence  between  EU-AIMS  and our study cohort is 
on the IQ of participants  and we speculate  that this diﬀerence  might 
drive the prediction  performance  loss. 
Functional  MRI had the strongest  impact on prediction  accuracy  
Studying  separately  the prediction  accuracy  obtained  for each imag- 
ing modality  showed  that functional  MRI contributed  more to predic- 
tion than anatomical  MRI (AUC = 0.79 using only functional  MRI, versus 
AUC = 0.66 using only anatomical  MRI, Fig. 2 c). Incorporating  age and 
sex information  only had a small inﬂuence  on prediction  accuracy  (in- 
creasing  AUC to 0.80). See Supplemental  Methods  M2 for additional  
information.  
Further increases  in sample size should lead to increased  prediction  
accuracy  
The analysis  of the learning  curve showed  that prediction  accuracy  
was not reaching  a plateau  and should keep improving  by increasing  the 
number  of subjects  ( Fig. 2 e). Extrapolating  on this increase,  we estimate  
that prediction  accuracy  could reach an AUC = 0.83 if a dataset of 10,000 
subjects  were available  (see Supplemental  Methods  M3 for additional  
information).

arousals  
Initial inspection  of the data indeed suggested  that the joint oc- 
currence  of K-complex  type slow waves, GS changes,  and autonomic  
arousals  reported  previously  during stage N2 sleep ( Ozbay et al., 2019 ) 
was also associated  with CSF inﬂow events ( Fig. 2 ). Comprehensive  
( n = 12) lag-dependent  correlation  analysis  ( Fig. 3 a,b ) indicated  that 
CSF inﬂow trailed SWA by 6–10 s, while fMRI GS changes  trailed SWA 
by 8–15 s. We also observed  a strong negative  correlation  near zero lag 
between  the derivative  of fMRI GS and the CSF signal ( Fig. 3 c ), which 
supports  the mechanistic  interpretation  that CBV decreases  cause CSF 
inﬂow ( Fultz et al., 2019 ). 
Further  analysis  showed  that signiﬁcant  correlation  between  SWA 
and CSF/GS  also occurred  outside  N2 ( Figs. 4 , S1 ). Importantly,  for 
NREM sleep, the variance  in fMRI signals explained  by SWA reduced  af- 
ter autonomic  correction  ( Fig. 4 , Table S1 ). This correction  was based 
on the estimated  relationship  between  the autonomic  signals (RFR and 
PVV) and the fMRI signal ( SM: Materials  and Methods  ). For GS, these 
variance  reductions  were 36 ± 32%, 68 ± 14%, 70 ± 15% for N3, N2, 
N1, respectively,  while for CSF, they were 34 ± 26%, 71 ± 15%, and 
50 ± 36%, respectively  (mean ± sd, Student’s  paired t -test: p < 0.05). 
This conﬁrms  the potential  role of autonomic  activity  in the observed  
SWA-fMRI  correlations.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10074, 10079), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1537, 1543), match='\n2.2. '>"

A simple aﬃne alignment  of the brains in the Talairach  reference

Fig. 1. Schematic  of the method pipeline.  First sub- 
tractograms  are obtained  for a speciﬁc region using 
a subset of cortical parcels. The subtractograms  from 
all subjects  are aligned to a “neutral  ”subject  using 
the geometry  of the sulcus in the middle of these 
parcels. Next, geometric  diﬀerences  between  sub- 
tractograms  are used to compute  a one-dimensional  
Isomap axis approximating  the population  variabil-  
ity. The population  is stratiﬁed  along this axis in or- 
der to create atlases from groups of similar subjects.  
Finally, the bundles across all groups are matched  
in order to infer a population-level  atlas but also to 
evaluate  the contribution  of each bundle to the sub- 
jects stratiﬁcation.  
that course around the sulci overlap  widely,  which leads to a diﬃcult  
disentanglement.  Therefore,  in the following,  a regional  reﬁnement  of 
the Talairach  alignment  is included,  driven by the geometry  of the sul- 
cus surrounded  by the ﬁbers involved  in the analysis.  It is limited to 
a rigid transformation  calculated  for each subject so as to superimpose  
its sulcus with a template  sulcus. This regional  cross-subject  alignment  
process,  which has been described  previously  ( Sun et al., 2012 ), selects 
as template  the sulcus that minimizes  the average  quadratic  distance  
to the sulci of the whole population.  Hence, the template  sulcus is sup- 
posed to have the most neutral  shape, yielding  the best alignment  across 
the population.  Finally,  after an initial aﬃne transformation  to the Ta- 
lairach space, the subtractograms  are further aligned  towards  this sulcus 
template,  leading  to a high-quality  alignment  of the ﬁbers relative  to the 
surrounded  sulcus geometry.  The resulting  alignment  is also employed  
further in the paper to perform  a sulcus shape analysis,  which is used to 
compare  folding and ﬁber variabilities.",\n?Resource | \n?3\.1\.\s*?\n?,"<re.Match object; span=(23378, 23384), match=' \n3.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2409, 2414), match='\n3.2.'>"

The tracer studies described  in the previous  section are not applica-  
ble to human subjects.  Klingler’s  dissection  technique  is the only means 
available  to anatomists  for following  ﬁber bundles  in ex vivo human 
brains. Detailed  descriptions  of this technique  are provided  in the re- 
views by Wysiadecki  et al. (2019) and Dziedzic  et al. (2021) . In short, 
the brain is ﬁxed in a 10% formalin  solution.  It must remain in ﬁxative

Fig. 2. Improved  in vivo human dMRI shows greater agreement  with NHP anatomic  studies.  Probabilistic  tractography  from a seed region in the frontal pole 
is shown for in vivo human dMRI datasets  acquired  with (a) a higher-resolution  protocol  ( b max = 10 K s/mm 2 , 384 directions,  1.5mm resolution),  and (b) a lower- 
resolution  protocol  ( b = 700 s/mm 2 , 60 directions,  2mm resolution).  Based on both anatomic  tracing and ex vivo dMRI tractography  in NHPs, we expect frontal pole 
to project through  the corpus callosum  (CC), internal capsule (IC), and uncinate  fasciculus  (UF), among other pathways.  These projections  are present consistently  in 
the higher-resolution  human dMRI tractography,  while many are missing in the lower-resolution  human dMRI tractography.  True positives  are marked with green 
arrows; false negatives  with yellow arrows. When discrepancies  between  human dMRI and NHP tracing disappear  as dMRI data quality improves,  these discrepancies  
are likely to be dMRI errors and not true inter-species  diﬀerences.  
for at least 2 months,  and suspension  prevents  it from deforming  during 
the ﬁxation  process.  The meninges  are carefully  removed.  The brain is 
frozen at -10 to -15°C for one week and then thawed  by washing  with 
running  water for one day. The brain is immersed  again in new for- 
malin and the freezing-thawing  procedure  can be performed  a second 
time. Klingler  and colleagues  recommended  freezing  the specimens  be- 
fore dissection,  because  they thought  that the formalin  solution  did not 
penetrate  the myelinated  nerve ﬁbers fully, resulting  in higher forma- 
lin concentrations  between  the ﬁbers. When the specimens  are frozen, 
formalin  ice crystals  form between  the nerve ﬁbers, expanding  and sep- 
arating them. The freezing  process  facilitates  the dissection  of ﬁne ﬁber 
bundles  in particular  ( Türe et al., 2000 ). Soft wooden  spatulas  are used 
to peel away the ﬁber bundles  along the anatomic  planes. When ﬁbers 
are too thin for the eye to see, an operating  microscope  can be used, 
with a ×6 to ×40 magniﬁcation.  
Protocols  vary among diﬀerent  publications  on Klingler’s  technique.  
Diﬀerences  are found in the perfusion  method  (whole body perfusion  or 
brain perfusion  via the vertebral  and carotid arteries),  freezing  time, fre- 
quency  of the freezing  procedure,  temperature  and formalin  percentage.  
Türe et al. (2000) and de Castro et al. (2005) provide  clear descriptions  
of Klingler’s  method.  Best practices  from these two reports are combined  
with our own experience  in the detailed  protocol  of Arnts et al (2013) . 
Türe et al. (2000) and de Castro et al. (2005) describe  the removal  of 
the pia mater, arachnoid  membrane,  and vessels of the specimens  using 
the operative  microscope.  However,  with some experience  it is possible  
to remove  the membranes  and vessels without  a microscope  ( Arnts et al., 
2013 ). Both Türe et al. (2000) and de Castro et al. (2005) also recom- 
mend that the brains be stored in a refrigerator  at -10 to -15 degrees  
Celsius and placed in fresh 10% formalin  solution  for 8–10 days. Freez- 
ing time diﬀers in Pujari et al. (2008) , who report a freezing  time of 
14 days. Castro et al. (2005) is the only one to repeat the freezing  pe- 
riods and freeze the brains in a formalin  solution.  For the dissection  
step itself, all authors  use wooden  spatulas  to tease out the white matter 
tracts by blunt dissection.  Lawes et al. (2008) use spatulas  of 3 mm or 
6 mm width. Most authors  also use an operation  microscope.  As with brain preparation,  the dissection  technique  diﬀers between  publications.  
Some report on a cortex-sparing  dissection  technique,  where not all cor- 
tex is scraped  away ( Martino  et al., 2011 ). Regardless  of the speciﬁcs  
of the technique,  however,  knowledge  of white matter anatomy  is cru- 
cial for Klingler’s  dissection.  For a review,  see Schmahmann  (2008) and 
Mandonnet  (2018) . 
With the introduction  of dMRI and tractography,  white matter dis- 
section has regained  interest  in the neuroimaging  and neuroanatomical  
community.  Klingler’s  dissection  is still practiced  to date, not only for 
research  on white-matter  anatomy,  but also for developing  surgical  ap- 
proaches  ( Türe et al. 2000 ; Baydin 2016 ), and for the preparation  of 
educational  specimens  ( Arnts et al. 2013 ).

In this study, we recorded  intracranial  data from 32 right-handed  
subjects  (12 female,  20 male, age: 26 ± 6 (rounded  mean ± std) years). 
The subjects  were patients  with intractable  epilepsy  who had SEEG 
electrodes  implanted  for pre-surgical  assessment  of their seizure fo- 
cus. The implantation  conﬁgurations  were totally determined  by clin- 
ical demands  rather than the needs of this research.  The study was 
conducted  in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki  and all sub- 
jects gave informed  consent  for this study, which was approved  by the 
Ethics Committee  of Huashan  Hospital  (Shanghai,  China, Approval  ID: 
KY2019518).  
SEEG signals were recorded  through  a clinical  EEG system (EEG- 
1200C,  Nihon Kohden,  Irvine, CA) and sampled  at 500–2000  Hz (See 
supplementary  Table 1 for the data recording  conﬁgurations  of each 
subject).  During the recording,  the signals of all SEEG contacts  were 
referenced  against  the average  of two adjacent  white matter contacts  
located  remotely  from the suspected  epileptogenic  foci and gray mat- 
ter to enhance  the quality of recordings.  This is the standard  technical  
procedure  ( Landre et al., 2018 ) and was implemented  by the surgeon  
during electrode  implantation.  Electromyographic  (EMG) signals were 
also recorded  from the extensor  carpi radialis  muscle through  two sur- 
face EMG electrodes  using the same ampliﬁer  and same sampling  rate 
as the SEEG signals.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11585, 11590), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1539, 1545), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118767,"2.1. Participants  
32 patients  with a chronic,  acquired  left hemispheric  brain lesion 
participated  in the study (age: mean ± SD = 51.9 ± 11.51 years, [range:  
25–76],  16 females).  The aetiologies  comprised  vascular  but also other 
CNS-diseases  leading  to a circumscribed  brain lesion. 2 Patients  were se- 
lected from a data bank of the Clinic for Cognitive  Neurology  (Univer-  
sity Hospital  Leipzig)  and the Max-Planck-Institute  for Human  Cognitive  
and Brain Sciences.  Exclusion  criteria  were additional  right-hemispheric  
lesions and severe overall cognitive  impairment.  Additional  cognitive  
impairments  were rated based on a detailed  assessment  of experienced  
neuropsychologists  to exclude  severe attentional,  overarching  memory  
and executive  deﬁcits.  Aphasia  was diagnosed  based on the standard  
German  assessment  battery  (Aachener  Aphasie  Test, AAT, Huber et al., 
1984 ); patients  with residual  or no aphasia  at the time of inclusion  had 
all been documented  to show an aphasic  deﬁcit at an earlier stage of 
the disease  ( Supplemental  Material  SM1 for demographic  and clinical  
2 Although  selective  inclusion  of ischemic  stroke survivors  is sometimes  con- 
sidered the best choice for lesion-behaviour  analyses,  we deliberately  deviate 
from this assumption.  Ischemic  strokes result from a heterogeneous  underlying  
pathology  (e.g. cardiogenic  vs. generalized  angiopathy)  and show preferential  
aﬀection  of speciﬁc vascular  territories.  We do not claim to fully control for 
this bias but suggest that a broader spectrum  of lesion site preference  related 
to diverse aetiologies  attenuates  this problem.  A second general caveat of all 
lesion-behavior  approaches,  especially  with vascular  pathologies,  results from 
the fact that a large proportion  of such patients  show ‘unspeciﬁc’  white mat- 
ter lesions, whose potential  functional  signiﬁcance  reduces the straightforward  
lesion-behavior  assignment.  Inclusion  of younger  participants  with lesions re- 
sulting from e.g. the removal  of a low-grade  glioma or stable disease neoplasm  
may attenuate  this general methodological  limitation.  Table 1

To evaluate  how the NODDI  output changed  with respect to the as- 
sumed axial diﬀusivity,  the standard  NODDI  model ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) 
was applied  to the diﬀusion  data with 𝑑 ∥= 1 . 7 , 2 . 3 or 3 μm 2 /ms . Brieﬂy,  
the NODDI  model consists  of a Watson-like  ﬁbre orientation  distribu-  
tion which is convolved  with three compartments  that are typically  as- 
sociated  with the CSF, extra-axonal  and intra-axonal  space. The ﬁrst 
compartment  has isotropic,  free diﬀusion,  the second compartment  de- 
scribes tensor-like  diﬀusion,  and the third compartment  describes  stick- 
like diﬀusion.  The model ﬁtting involves  5 parameters  being estimated  
(the intra-axonal  signal fraction,  the isotropic  signal fraction,  the ﬁ- 
bre orientation  and orientation  dispersion  index, [ 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 , 𝑓 𝑖𝑠𝑜 , 𝜃, 𝜙, 𝑂𝐷𝐼] ) 
whilst assuming  some ﬁxed, global axial diﬀusivity  which may dif- 
fer from 𝑑 ∥= 1 . 7 μm 2 /ms , that the radial diﬀusivity  of the tensor-like  
compartment  is given by the tortuosity  model 𝑑 ⟂= 𝑑 ∥(1 − 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 ) and that 
the diﬀusivity  of the isotropic  compartment  is that of free diﬀusion  
𝑑 𝑖𝑠𝑜 = 3 μm 2 /ms . 
Here we utilised  preprocessed  T1-weighted  and diﬀusion-weighted  
data for the ﬁrst 10 subjects  of the WU-Minn  Human  Connectom  Project 
(HCP); for details of the acquisition  protocol  and preprocessing  pipeline,  
please see ( Glasser  et al., 2013; Sotiropoulos  et al., 2013; Van Essen 
et al., 2013 ). Brieﬂy,  the diﬀusion-weighted  data included  90 gradient  
directions  each at b-values  of 𝑏 = 1 , 2 and 3 ms/ μm 2 and 18 interspersed  
volumes  with negligible  diﬀusion  weighting.  The distortion  corrected  
(“pre-processed  ”) 𝑏 ∼0 ms/ 𝜇m 2 data were linearly  registered  to each 
subject’s  T1-weighted  structural  scan (FLIRT ( Jenkinson  et al., 2002; 
Jenkinson  and Smith, 2001 )), and the T1 non-linearly  registered  to the 
MNI standard  space (FNIRT  ( Andersson  et al., 2007; Woolrich  et al., 
2009 )). The NODDI  ﬁtting ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) was performed  in sub- 
ject space using the cuDIMOT  framework  ( Hernandez-Fernandez  et al.,

2.1.1. Dataset 
The dataset used in the study contains  31 recordings  collected  as de- 
scribed  in Onton and Makeig  (2009) . The data are available  at HeadIT  
website  ( http://headit.ucsd.edu  , Imagined  Emotion  with Continuous  Data 
under Studies ). EEG data were collected  from 250 scalp channels  using 
a Biosemi  ActiveTwo  system (Amsterdam,  Netherlands)  at a sampling  
rate of 256 Hz per channel  with 24-bit resolution.  Caps with a custom  
whole-head  montage  were used to position  the electrodes  on most of 
the scalp, forehead,  and lateral face surface,  omitting  chin and ﬂeshy 
cheek areas. Relative  3D locations  of the electrodes  for each partici-  
pant were recorded  (Polhemus,  Inc.). For more details,  see Onton and 
Makeig  (2009) and the description  on the HeadIT  website.  
2.1.2. Experiment  and participants  
Thirty-one  volunteer  participants  participated  in the emotion  imag- 
ination experiment  (19 females;  age 25 . 5 ± 5 years) and gave informed  
consent  in accordance  with UCSD institutional  review board require-  
ments. All participants  reported  being able to induce realistic  emotional  
experiences  for most of the suggested  emotions  by following  a recorded  
verbal narrative  and using their own imagination.  For example,  for 
“anger the narrative  suggested  that the participant  either recall a sit- 
uation in which they had been angry, or else imagine  a scene in which 
they would become  angry, giving two examples  ( “You ﬁnd someone  
smashing  your car for no reason with a baseball  bat.). Throughout  the 
experiment,  participants  were seated comfortably  with eyes closed in 
a quiet, dimly-lit  room, and listened  to the narratives  through  ear-bud  
earphones.  
Fig. 1 a shows the paradigm  of the self-paced  emotion  imagination  
experiment.  Each session began with 2 min of silent eyes-closed  rest, fol- 
lowed by pre-recorded  general  instructions  and then a 5 min guided re- 
laxation  induction  to promote  a relaxed,  inwardly-focused  state of mind. 
In 15 following  task periods,  the participant  was presented  with a se- 
quence of recorded  voice-guided  inductions  instructing  them to recall 
or imagine  scenarios  for stimulating  a vivid, embodied  experience  of 
the suggested  emotion.  Participants  were encouraged  to pay attention  
to their somatic  state, as such attention  tended to increase  the vividness  
and duration  of their emotional  experience  ( Damasio,  1999 ). Partici-  
pants were told to take as much time as they needed  to recall or imag- 
ine a scenario  that would induce a realistic  experience  of the suggested  
emotion.  No external  time limits or indicators  were provided.  Partici-  
pants pressed  a right-hand  held thumb button once to signal they had 
begun to have a somatic  experience  of (i.e., to “feel) the targeted  emo- 
tion, then a left-hand  held button when the imagined  scene and feeling 
began to wane, triggering  (40 s) instructions  to again relax (through  a 
following  silent 10 s period),  letting go of the previously  experienced  
scene and feeling.  Then a 10 s audio clip prepared  them for the next 
emotion  imagination  period. 
The 15 emotional  imagination  periods  were presented  in a pseudo-  
random  sequence  that alternated  between  one of eight positive-valence  
emotions  (love, joy, happiness,  relief, compassion,  contentedness,  ex- 
citement,  awe) followed  one of seven negative-valence  emotions  (anger, 
jealousy,  disgust,  frustration,  fear, sadness,  grief). The experimental  ses-

2.1.3. Data preprocessing  
The data obtained  from the HeadIT  portal were already  pre- 
processed  as described  in Onton and Makeig  (2009) including  removal  
of bad channels  (e.g., involving  electrodes  with poor skin contact,  judged by their grossly abnormal  activity  patterns),  leaving  134–235  
channels  per subject (214 ± 18, mean ± SD), re-referencing  to digitally  
linked mastoids,  and digital ﬁltering  above 1 Hz. Data periods  contain-  
ing broadly  distributed,  high-amplitude  muscle noise and other irregu- 
lar artifacts  identiﬁed  by tests for high-kurtosis  or low-probability  ac- 
tivity were removed  from analysis  using EEGLAB  functions  ( Delorme  
and Makeig,  2004; Delorme  et al., 2007 ). The occurrence  of eye blinks, 
3  S.-H. Hsu, Y. Lin, J. Onton et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118873 
other eye movements,  or tonic muscle tension  artifacts  were not cri- 
teria for data rejection,  as these were typically  well-separated  by ICA 
decomposition  into separate  component  processes  that were withheld  
from subsequent  analyses.  
Further  preprocessing  steps were applied  to the data prior to the 
application  of AMICA  decomposition  as schematized  in Fig. 1 b. Data 
before the ﬁrst eye-closed  rest session and after the last eye-closed  rest 
session were removed.  Data were then re-referenced  to a common  aver- 
age reference.  Artifact  subspace  reconstruction  (ASR) ( Kothe and Jung, 
2016; Mullen et al., 2015 ) with a cutoﬀparameter  20 was applied  for 
automatic  removal  of large-amplitude  artifacts  like electrode  pops and 
motion artifacts,  which has been shown to improve  subsequent  ICA de- 
composition  ( Chang et al., 2019 ). 
Data were reduced  to 128 channels  by sub-selecting  channels  in- 
volving  scalp electrodes  that were maximally  evenly spaced using the 
loc-subsets()  function  in EEGLAB.  The reason for this decimation  was 
to address  the following  three practical  issues: insuﬃcient  samples  for 
learning  a larger number  of model parameters  (the size of the unmix- 
ing matrix is proportional  to the square of the number  of channels);  
computation  time (as constrained  by resources  available);  variations  
across participants  in the number  of retained  channels.  Eﬀects of chan- 
nel number  on AMICA  decomposition  performance  are further discussed

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119752,"2.1. Subjects  and dataset 
We analyzed  MEG data from two datasets.  The ﬁrst dataset was 
recorded  at the MEG-Center  Tübingen  and included  eyes-open  resting-  
state MEG measurements  from 34 subjects.  17 of these subjects  (8 fe- 
male, mean age ( ± std) 31.1 ± 9.6 years) were diagnosed  with relapsing-  
remitting  MS (RRMS)  and 17 subjects  were healthy  controls  (9 female,  
mean age ( ± std) 28.4 ± 4.2 years, p = 0.30). The patient group was 
measured  prior to the ﬁrst application  of Tecﬁdera  (dimethyl  fumarate;  
BioGen  Inc., Cambridge,  MA, USA) with a median  disease  duration  
of 1 month (0–3 years interquartile  range, maximum  11 years). Pa- 
tients had no or mild to moderate  neurological  impairment,  which was 
assessed  with the Expanded  Disability  Status Scale ( n = 16; median  
EDSS total = 1.5, range 0 to 3.5; Kurtzke,  1983 ) and the Multiple  Sclerosis  
Functional  Composite  ( n = 13; median  MSFC totalz = − 1.8, range − 0.3 to 
− 3.3; Fischer  et al., 1999 ). All participants  gave written  informed  con- 
sent in accord with the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and the study was ap- 
proved by the ethics committee  of the medical  faculty of the University  
of Tübingen.  
We collected  10 min of eyes-open  resting-state  MEG data per sub- 
ject. The MEG was continuously  recorded  with a 275-channel  whole- 
head system (Omega  2000, CTF Systems  Inc., Port Coquitlam,  Canada)  
in a magnetically  shielded  room. The head position  was tracked  using 
three head localization  coils ﬁxated at the nasion and the left and right preauricular  points. MEG signals were recorded  with 2343.75  Hz sam- 
pling frequency  and down sampled  to 1000 Hz oﬄine. 
A T1-weighted  sagittal  MRI was obtained  from each participant  to 
construct  individual  high-resolution  head models (MPRAGE  sequence,  
TE = 2.18 ms, TR = 2300 ms, TI = 1100 ms, ﬂip angle = 9°, 192 slices, 
voxel size = 1 ×1 ×1 mm). The subjects  were scanned  in a Siemens  
MAGNETOM  Trio 3T scanner  (Erlangen,  Germany)  with a 32-channel  
head coil. 
The second dataset included  95 subjects  from the publicly  avail- 
able human connectome  project (HCP) S900 release ( Larson-Prior  et al., 
2013 ). Participants  were healthy  adults in the age range between  22 and 
35 years (n 22–25 = 18, n 26–30 = 40, n 31–35 = 37). The HCP-sample  in- 
cluded 45 females.  The HCP-MEG  data included  three six-minute  blocks 
of eyes-open  resting-state  MEG with short breaks in between  measure-  
ments. Data were recorded  with a whole-head  Magnes  3600 scanner  (4D 
Neuroimaging,  San Diego, CA, USA) situated  in a magnetically  shielded  
room ( Larson-Prior  et al., 2013 ). Additionally,  the HCP-subjects  were 
scanned  on a Siemens  3T Skyra to acquire  structural  T1-weighted  mag- 
netic resonance  images (MRI) with 0.7 mm isotropic  resolution  ( Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ). The BTI/4D  MEG system used in the HCP dataset is 
a potential  source for dissociations  to the Tübingen  dataset,  which was 
recorded  with a CTF MEG system.  However,  we did not ﬁnd any sig- 
niﬁcant  diﬀerence  of the coupling  structure  (see below) between  the 
healthy  subjects  measured  with the two systems  below 32 Hz (r att > 
0.95 & 0.90 for amplitude-,  and phase-coupling,  respectively;  p r < 1,fdr 
> 0.05). For higher frequencies  ( > = 32 Hz) the correlation  between  
the datasets  dropped  to r = 0.26 and 0.70 for amplitude-  and phase- 
coupling,  respectively,  which can likely be attributed  to stronger  muscle 
artifact  contamination  of the HCP dataset (Fig. S1). However,  impor- 
tantly, while the potentially  weaker  reduction  of muscle artifacts  in the 
HCP-preprocessing  may in principle  aﬀect component  selection,  it can- 
not lead to false-positive  components  for classiﬁcation  of patients  and 
control subjects.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(8704, 8709), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3886, 3892), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119519,"2.1. Empirical  mode decomposition  techniques  
To obtain the instantaneous  phase ( Boccaletti  et al., 2018 ) of a real 
signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) one must ﬁrst construct  an analytic  signal: 
𝑧 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑗{ 𝑥 ( 𝑡 )} (1) 
where 𝑗 = √
−1 and represents  the Hilbert transform.  This signal can 
be re-expressed  as follows:  
𝑧 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝔄 ( 𝑡 ) exp (𝑗𝜙( 𝑡 ) )(2) 
where 𝔄 ( 𝑡 ) represents  the envelope  and 𝜙( 𝑡 ) the instantaneous  phase. 
An important  consideration  when computing  instantaneous  
phase is the need for 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) to satisfy Bedrosian’s  Product  Theorem  
( Bedrosian,  1963 ), which states that a band-limited  signal can be 
decomposed  into the product  of envelope  and phase when their spectra  
are disjoint.  A necessary  condition  for this to hold is that 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is ﬁrst 
narrow-banded  by applying  a bandpass  ﬁlter. Choosing  the type and 
bandwidth  for the bandpass  ﬁlter required  to perform  the analysis  is 
one of the greater challenges  when using these types of approaches.  In 
addition,  ambiguities  can persist whether  the chosen bandpass  ﬁlter 
actually  ensures  that the signal is suﬃciently  narrow-band  for applying  
the Hilbert transform  to construct  the analytic  signal. Therefore,  we 
seek more data-driven  alternatives  for achieving  the equivalent  goals. 
One such alternative  is the Hilbert Huang transform,  which is EMD 
followed  by the Hilbert transform.  Here EMD is used in place of band- 
pass ﬁltering.  EMD oﬀers a data-driven  way to decompose  the signal 
of interest  into a series of IMFs that correspond  to diﬀerent  frequency  
bands. An IMF is a function  where the number  of extrema  and zero- 
crossings  diﬀer at most by one, and the mean value of the upper (deﬁned  
by the local maxima)  and lower envelopes  (deﬁned  by the local minima)  
is equal to zero. The IMFs are zero-mean  amplitude-frequency  modu- 
lated signals,  designed  to ensure that Bedrosian’s  theorem  is respected  
and that subsequent  application  of the Hilbert transform  will result in 
physically  meaningful  instantaneous  phases of the input signal ( Huang,  2014; ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011 ). Together,  these IMFs form a set 
of approximately  orthogonal  basis that can be used to reconstruct  the 
input signal. The ﬁrst IMF consists  of the largest frequency  oscillation  
present  in the signal, and each subsequent  IMF consists  of increasingly  
smaller  frequency  oscillations  than those previously  extracted.  
The practical  implementation  of EMD is described  in Algorithm  1 in 
the Supplementary  Material,  where Steps 2–6 are referred  to as the sift- 
ing process ( Huang et al., 1998 ). The ﬁrst step is to identify  all the local 
extrema  present  in the input signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) . All local maxima  are connected  
using a cubic spline which create an upper envelope  for the signal. Sim- 
ilarly, all local minima  are used to create a lower envelope.  The two 
envelopes  create an upper and lower bound for the data. The mean 𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) 
is computed  by taking their average.  The diﬀerence  between  the data 
and mean, 𝑑( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) , is considered  a candidate  IMF. This process  
is repeated  until a stoppage  criterion  is fulﬁlled,  and the current  value 
of 𝑑( 𝑡 ) is designated  as an IMF. Once, the IMF is set it is subtracted  from 
the signal and the sifting process  is performed  on the new signal. This 
process  is repeated,  each time removing  the previously  deﬁned  set of 
IMFs from 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) , until the desired  number  of IMFs have been obtained.  
The stoppage  criterion  used in EMD determines  the number  of sifting 
steps that are performed  when deriving  IMFs. 
There are a number  of commonly  used stoppage  criterion,  and in 
this paper we use the threshold  method  ( Rilling et al., 2003 ). This cri- 
terion is based on imposing  two thresholds  𝜃1 and 𝜃2 aimed at ensuring  
globally  small ﬂuctuations  in the mean while taking locally large ex- 
cursions  into consideration  ( Rilling et al., 2003 ). Let us deﬁne the am- 
plitude as 𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) ∶= ( 𝑒 max ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑒 min ( 𝑡 ))∕2 , where 𝑒 max ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑒 min ( 𝑡 ) are the 
upper and lower envelope,  respectively,  and the evaluation  function  as 
𝜎( 𝑡 ) ∶= |𝑚 ( 𝑡 )∕ 𝑎 ( 𝑡 ) |. The sifting process  is repeated  until 𝜎( 𝑡 ) < 𝜃1 for some 
fraction  (1 − 𝛼) of the total number  of iterations  and 𝜎( 𝑡 ) < 𝜃2 for the 
remaining  fraction.  The recommended  values for these thresholds  pro- 
posed by Rilling et al. (2003) , which we use in this paper, are 𝛼≈0 . 05 , 
𝜃1 ≈0 . 05 , and 𝜃2 ≈1 0 𝜃1 . 
2.1.1. Bivariate  empirical  mode decomposition  
Often it is of interest  to extract IMFs from a collection  of signals.  A 
simple approach  is to apply the standard  EMD algorithm  separately  to 
each signal and extract a set of IMFs from each. However,  this does not 
guarantee  that the frequencies  of the extracted  IMFs match across sig- 
nals, nor will the repeated  application  of the EMD algorithm  necessarily  
produce  the same number  of IMFs for all signals.  This is particularly  
problematic  within the PS framework,  where one seeks to compare  sig- 
nals within the same frequency  band. To circumvent  this issue and allow 
for the decomposition  of a bivariate  or multivariate  signal, various  ex- 
tensions  of EMD have been proposed  that perform  the decomposition  
jointly ( ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011 ). 
To decompose  bivariate  signals,  EMD should be performed  so 
that the decomposition  and sifting process  is applied  on the enve- 
lope of the bivariate  signal. This ensures  that the number  and fre- 
quency  of the decomposed  IMFs corresponding  to each signal match. 
Rilling et al. (2007) proposed  an extension  of EMD, referred  to as 
BEMD, for handling  signal pairs. Here the bivariate  signal is treated 
as a complex-valued  signal 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) to simplify  representation.  In general,  
given a set of directions  in the complex  plane, BEMD follows  the same 
algorithm  as EMD except that the sifting process  is performed  jointly on 
the signal pair. Thus, for bivariate  signals the looping  of the algorithm  is 
performed  in the directions  𝜋and 2 𝜋. In each direction  all extrema  are 
extracted  and the set of points interpolated  using cubic splines to obtain 
the envelopes.  The envelopes  corresponding  to these directions  are av- 
eraged to obtain the local mean. The practical  implementation  of BEMD 
is described  in Algorithm  2 ( Rilling et al., 2007 ) in the Supplementary  
Material.  
2.1.2. Multivariate  empirical  mode decomposition  
While BEMD addresses  the misalignment  of IMFs for a given pair of 
signals,  it does not guarantee  that the IMFs will be aligned  globally  if 
3  H. Honari and M.A. Lindquist NeuroImage  261 (2022) 119519 
applied  in a pair-wise  manner  to the components  of a multivariate  signal 
consisting  of more than two signals.  To ensure that the same number  of 
IMFs are produced  and to avoid the misalignment  of the IMFs when ana- 
lyzing more than two signals,  multivariate  extensions  of EMD have been 
proposed.  For example,  an extension  to the trivariate  case was proposed  
by ur Rehman  and Mandic  (2010) and a more general  multivariate  case 
by Rehman  and Mandic  (2010) . 
The latter extension  involves  processing  the signals directly  in mul- 
tidimensional  space. First, the signal is projected  along diﬀerent  di- 
rections  in 𝑛 -dimensional  space. Using the projections,  multiple  𝑛 - 
dimensional  envelopes  are computed,  which are used to obtain the local 
mean. Calculation  of the local mean can be thought  of as an approxima-  
tion of the integral  of all envelopes  in multiple  directions  in ℝ 𝑛 . The ac- 
curacy of this integral  is bounded  by how uniformly  the direction  vectors  
used to perform  the projections  are selected.  The direction  vectors  in 𝑛 - 
dimensional  space can be represented  by points on a multi-dimensional  
sphere of unit radius. Hence, the problem  becomes  ﬁnding  a uniform  
sampling  scheme  on the sphere.  This can be obtained  either using uni- 
form angular  sampling  or sampling  based on low-discrepancy  point sets. 
While the ﬁrst scheme  provides  a simple and easy way for sampling  a 
unit sphere in ℝ 𝑛 , it does not provide  a uniform  sampling  distribution  as 
it gives rise to higher density  closer to the poles. Thus, the second sam- 
pling scheme,  which relies on the concept  of discrepancy  (a measure  of 
the non-uniformity  of a distribution)  to create a uniform  point set on 
spheres  is leveraged.  A standard  approach  for obtaining  such a point set 
is based on the Hammersley  sequence  ( Cui and Freeden,  1997 ). 
Given the set of direction  vectors  obtained  using the aforementioned  
sampling  scheme,  the projections  𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) , for 𝑡 = 1 …𝑇 , of the input signal 
𝐱( 𝑡 ) along directions  𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 𝑘 in multidimensional  space are calculated  as 
𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐱( 𝑡 ) 𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 𝑘 . Thereafter,  the time instants  { 𝑡 𝜑 𝑘 
𝑗 } corresponding  to 
the maxima  of the projection  𝑝 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) are determined.  These extrema  are 
interpolated  via cubic spline interpolation  to get a series of multivariate  
signal envelopes  𝐞 𝜑 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) . The local mean is computed  by averaging  the 
envelopes.  This is followed  by the sifting process  to extract the IMFs 
from the multivariate  data until the stoppage  criterion  is met for all the 
projected  signals.  The implementation  of MEMD is shown in Algorithm  
3 ( Huang,  2014; Rehman  and Mandic,  2010 ) in the Supplementary  Ma- 
terial. 
2.1.3. Noise-assisted  multivariate  empirical  mode decomposition  
While MEMD is a powerful  tool, it can suﬀer from a mode-mixing  
phenomena  when analyzing  real signals.  This refers to when an IMF 
has components  from multiple  frequencies  ( Xu et al., 2019 ), which oc- 
curs when oscillations  with diﬀerent  time scales coexist in the same 
IMF or when the oscillations  in the same time scale are assigned  to dif- 
ferent IMFs. Mode mixing can occur when the frequencies  of the con- 
stituent  signals are too close to one another  or when the amplitude  of 
the low frequency  signal is too large ( Xu et al., 2019 ). The issue of 
mode mixing hampers  the application  of EMD and MEMD ( Gao et al., 
2008; ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011; Rilling and Flandrin,  2007; Wu and 
Huang,  2009; Xu et al., 2019 ), and to mitigate  this issue noise-assisted  
MEMD (na-MEMD)  was introduced  ( Colominas  et al., 2012; Wu and 
Huang,  2009; Yeh et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017 ). 
This approach  uses the fact that when applied  to Gaussian  WN, both 
standard  and multivariate  EMD behave as a ﬁlter bank of overlapping  
bandpass  ﬁlters where the frequency  bands have half the width of their 
predecessors.  In na-MEND,  𝑝 uncorrelated  Gaussian  WN signals of the 
same length as the original  𝑛 input signals are created.  By processing  
the 𝑝 + 𝑛 multivariate  signals using the MEMD algorithm,  multivariate  
IMFs can be extracted.  Because  the added noise signals occupy a broad 
range in the frequency  spectrum,  MEMD aligns the IMFs based on the 
dyadic ﬁlter bank properties  described  above, which in turn mitigates  
mode-mixing  ( ur Rehman  and Mandic,  2011; Yeh et al., 2010 ). The 𝑝 
IMFs corresponding  to the added noise signals are discarded,  leaving  the 
IMFs corresponding  to the original  input signal.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(17695, 17700), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(11508, 11513), match='2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119452,"2.1. Inference  on change in parameters  
Given a baseline  measurement  (y), an observed  change in the mea- 
surement  ( Δ𝑦 ), and a generative  biophysical  model (  ), we aim to in- 
vestigate  what pattern  of change ( ̂Δ𝑣 ) in the model parameters  ( 𝑣 ) can 
best explain  this observed  change in the measurements  ( Fig. 1 ). A pat- 
tern of change is a unit vector in the parameter  space, e.g. it can be a 
change in a single parameter  or any linear combination  of the model 
parameters.  For simplicity  of the explanations  and notation,  we only 
assume  a single parameter  change in the rest of paper, but all the equa- 
tions apply to any linear combination  of the parameters.  If the model 
is invertible,  we may directly  estimate  Δ𝑣 by inverting  the model on y 
and 𝑦 + Δ𝑦 to get the corresponding  parameter  estimates  and calculate  
the diﬀerences.  Alternatively,  in BENCH  we estimate  𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦, Δ𝑦 ) , that 
is the posterior  probability  for the pattern  of change ̂Δ𝑣 conditioned  on 
the observed  baseline  ( 𝑦 ) and change in the data( Δ𝑦 ). Using Bayes’ rule: 
𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦, Δ𝑦 ) = 𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) 𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦 ) 
∑
̂Δ𝑣 ′𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ′) 𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ′∣𝑦 ) (1) 
We assume  no prior preference  between  the patterns  of change given 
the baseline  measurements(i.e.  𝑃 ( ̂Δ𝑣 ∣𝑦 ) is uniform),  so to estimate  the 
posterior  probabilities  we only need to estimate  the likelihood  term 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 |𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) . The pattern  of change ̂Δ𝑣 represents  the direction  but not 
the amount  of the change in the parameters.  We therefore  marginalize  
the likelihood  with respect to the amount  of change ( |Δ𝑣 |) : 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) = ∫𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑑 |Δ𝑣 | (2) 
We assume  that the prior distribution  for the amount  of change follows  
a log-normal  pdf with a ﬁxed mean and scale parameter  (adjustable

Fig. 2. Distribution  of derivatives.  The way measurements  change as a result of a particular  change in the parameters  can only be calculated  if we know the baseline  
parameters.  When we are only given the measurements,  there are several instances  of equally likely derivative  directions  depending  on the underlying  baseline  
parameters.  We model all of these derivatives  given the baseline  measurements  as a random variable  with a presumed  distribution.  This allows us to transfer the 
uncertainty  due to the inverse model degeneracy  into the measurement  space. The blue oval in the parameter  space (left) represents  all the parameter  settings that 
map onto the same blue point in the measurement  space(right).  Each of these parameter  settings can produce  a diﬀerent  derivative  direction  in the measurements  
space. The collection  of such derivatives  of change ̂Δ𝑣 for the measurement  𝑦 are modelled  as a Gaussian  distribution  with mean 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) and covariance  Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) . (For 
interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
hyper parameters).  A log-normal  PDF is chosen to allow for changes  
across several order of magnitudes.  
The likelihood  term inside the integral,  𝑃 (Δy |y , ̂Δv , |Δv |) , deﬁnes 
how the measurements  change as a result of a fully characterised  vector 
of change in the parameters  with the given direction  ( ̂Δ𝑣 ) and amount  
( |Δ𝑣 |). To relate this parameter  change to a change in data one also 
needs to know the baseline  parameters  ( 𝑣 ), as 
Δ𝑦 =  ( 𝑣 + |Δ𝑣 |̂Δ𝑣 ) −  ( 𝑣 ) + 𝜖 (3) 
where 𝜖is the measurement  noise. However,  for a degenerate  biophys-  
ical model, we cannot estimate  a unique set of baseline  parameters  𝑣 
for which to estimate  Eq. (3) . While, one could integrate  over all pos- 
sible values of 𝑣 , this is a very high-dimensional  integral,  which would 
be very computationally  expensive.  Instead,  we propose  an alternative  
way to avoid the need of estimating  the baseline  parameters  to estimate  
the likelihood.  
Assuming  that |Δ𝑣 |is reasonably  small, and  is behaving  smoothly  
w.r.t 𝑣 , using a Taylor expansion  we can express  Δ𝑦 as: 
Δ𝑦 = ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) |Δ𝑣 |+ 𝜖 (4) 
Where ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) is the derivative  of  in the direction  of ̂Δ𝑣 at point 𝑣 , 
and 𝜖is the measurement  noise. Given the baseline  measurements  ( 𝑦 ), 
but not the baseline  parameters  ( 𝑣 ), there can be an inﬁnite  number  of 
∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑣 ) for a degenerate  model ( Fig. 2 ). To account  for all instances  
of the derivative,  we model ∇ ̂Δ𝑣  given 𝑦 as a random  variable  that 
follows  a normal  distribution  with hyperparameters  𝜇( 𝑦 ) and Σ( 𝑦 ) , i.e. 
∇ ̂Δ𝑣  ( 𝑦 ) ∼𝑁( 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) , Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 )) (5) 
where 𝜇̂Δ𝑣 represents  the average  expected  change in the measurements  
as a result of change in parameters  in the direction  ̂Δ𝑣 , Σ̂Δ𝑣 represents  
the uncertainty  around this expectation  due to the unknown  baseline  
parameters  ( Fig. 2 ), and 𝑁( 𝑚, 𝐶) represents  a Gaussian  PDF with mean 
𝑚 and covariance  𝐶. This formulation  allows us to transfer  the uncer- 
tainty in the baseline  parameters  to an uncertainty  in the measurement  
space, which we can model and predict.  In the next section we will de- 
scribe a method  for estimating  𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) and Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) by training  regression  
models using simulated  data. Once we compute  these hyperparameters,  
by inserting  Eq. (5) back into Eq. (4) we can compute  the likelihood  term inside the integral  by 
𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) = 𝑁( |Δ𝑣 |𝜇̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) , |Δ𝑣 |2 Σ̂Δ𝑣 ( 𝑦 ) + Σ𝑛 ) (6) 
where Σ𝑛 is the noise covariance  matrix.  
Finally,  by computing  the integral  over the size of the parameter  
change in Eq. (2) numerically,  we are able to approximate  the likeli- 
hood function  𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) which we can then use in Eq. (1) yielding  
the desired  posterior  distribution  on the change in parameters.  More- 
over, using the approximation  of the likelihood  function  in Eq. (6) the 
posterior  probability  of the amount  of change for each direction  is pro- 
portional  to 
𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |∣Δ𝑦, 𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 ) ∝𝑃 (Δ𝑦 ∣𝑦, ̂Δ𝑣 , |Δ𝑣 |) 𝑃 ( |Δ𝑣 |) (7) 
Note that this likelihood  function  is unnormalized  so a high or low value 
doesn’t necessarily  reﬂect the quality of the change model in explain-  
ing the data. For such measure  please refer to Appendix  B . We can still 
estimate  the most likely amount  of change in the parameter  given the 
measurements  by ﬁnding  the |Δ𝑣 |that maximizes  the above posterior  
probability  (maximum  a posteriori  estimation).  Alternatively,  we can 
estimate  the expected  value of the amount  of change by integrating  this 
posterior  probability  distribution  multiplied  by |Δ𝑣 |over |Δ𝑣 |.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10258, 10263), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(6775, 6781), match='\n2.2. '>"

2.1.1. Dataset I (AHEAD)  
Subjects  and data. We used the open source AHEAD  7T quantitative  
MRI dataset ( Alkemade  et al., 2020 ). Data were acquired  at the Spinoza  
centre for Neuroimaging  in Amsterdam,  using a Philips Achieva  7T MRI 
scanner.  Image resolution  is 0.7 mm isotropic.  The data includes  T1- 
weighted  (T1w) images as well as quantitative  R1, R2 ∗ and susceptibility  
maps (for full data acquisition  and analysis  see ( Alkemade  et al., 2020 )). 
The data consist of 105 subjects  aged 18–80 years. From these data we 
chose 67 subjects  who fall in one of two age groups:  young adults (N = 42, 
range 18–30 years; 27 females)  and older adults (N = 25, range 61–70 
years; 14 females).  Subjects’  exact ages were not available.  2.1.2. Dataset II (HUJID)  
The dataset was collected  as part of a previously  published  work; for 
full details,  see ( Filo et al., 2019 ). 
Subjects.  Measurements  were performed  on healthy  individuals  in two 
age groups:  22 young adults (11 females,  aged 27 ± 2.2 years, range 23–
31) and 17 older adults (4 females,  aged 67 ± 5.6 years, range 55–75).  
We excluded  1 older female subject from our analysis  due to a de- 
tected abnormality  in her caudate  nucleus.  All subjects  had R1 maps. 
17 younger  subjects  had R2 ∗ maps (7 females).  QSM was available  in 
15 younger  subjects  (7 females,  ages 27 ± 2.5 years), and 15 older sub- 
jects (3 females,  ages 67 ± 5.8 years). Furthermore,  3 subjects’  data was 
collected  twice, few days apart, for a scan-rescan  analysis  (1 female,  
ages 28 ± 3.8 years). 
Data acquisition.  Data were collected  on a 3T Siemens  MAGNETOM  
Skyra scanner  at the ELSC neuroimaging  unit at the Hebrew  University  
of Jerusalem  (HUJI).  
For quantitative  R1 and R2 ∗ mappings,  3D spoiled  proﬁle echo 
(SPGR)  images were acquired  with four diﬀerent  ﬂip angles ( 𝛼= 4°, 10°, 
20°, and 30°). Each image includes  ﬁve equally  spaced echoes,  with echo 
time (TE) of 3.34–14.02  ms, except for 5 young subjects  for whom the 
scan included  only one TE (3.34 ms). The repetition  time (TR) was 19 ms 
and the scan resolution  was 1 mm isotropic.  For bias estimation,  spin- 
echo inversion  recovery  images were acquired  with echo-planar  imag- 
ing read-out  (SEIR-EPI).  For these images,  the TE/TR = 49/2920  ms, the 
slice thickness  was 3 mm, and in-plane  resolution  was 2 mm 2 . Four im- 
ages were acquired  with varying  inversion  times (TI) = 200, 400, 1200, 
and 2400 ms. 
For quantitative  susceptibility  mapping  (QSM) we acquired  multi- 
echo gradient  echo images at a resolution  of 1 mm isotropic.  The ﬂip 
angle was 15°, the TR was 41 ms and images had 7 echoes at 8.41, 14.04, 
18.86, 22.45, 26.28, 30.89, and 35.52 ms. 
Finally,  for image segmentation,  anatomical  T1w images were 
acquired  with either 3D magnetization-prepared  rapid proﬁle echo 
(MPRAGE)  or magnetization-prepared  2 rapid acquisition  proﬁle echoes 
(MP2RAGE).  
Estimation  of qMRI parameters.  Whole-brain  R1 maps, as well as ﬁeld 
bias maps of excitation  (B1 + ), were computed  using the mrQ software  
( https://github.com/mezera/mrQ  ). In short, biased T1 maps were cal- 
culated  using the variable  ﬂip angles which were corrected  for B1 ex- 
cite inhomogeneity  using the unbiased  SEIR data ( Barral et al., 2010 ; 
Mezer et al., 2013 ). 
Whole brain R2 ∗ maps were estimated  for subjects  scanned  with mul- 
tiple echo SPGR using the MPM toolbox  ( Tabelow  et al., 2019a ). The 4 
separate  R2 ∗ maps, acquired  from each of the four SPGR images (with 
the varying  ﬂip angles),  were then averaged  for increased  signal-to-noise  
ratio (SNR). 
QSM was performed  using a Tikonov-regularization-based  estima-  
tion ( Karsa et al., 2020 ). The preprocessing  was performed  using the 
Morphology  Enabled  Dipole Inversion  (MEDI)  toolbox  ( Liu et al., 2012 ). 
The preprocessing  stages include  (1) calculating  the frequency  oﬀset in 
each voxels using complex  ﬁtting, (2) spatial phase unwrapping,  and (3) 
background  ﬁeld removal.  
The R1 and R2 ∗ maps are aligned  as they are derived  from the same 
scans. The QSM and T1-weighted  images were registered  to the R1 space 
using FSL’s linear registration  command  FLIRT ( Jenkinson  et al., 2002 ; 
Jenkinson  and Smith, 2001 ). 
2.1.3. T1w/T2w  and diﬀusion  dataset (HCP) 
Subjects.  To demonstrate  the proﬁles  of the midbrain  with clinical  pa- 
rameters,  data were obtained  from the publicly  released  Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP) Young Adult dataset ( van Essen et al., 2012 ). The 
data consists  of 1206 healthy  young adults (age range 22–37 years). Ex- 
clusion criteria  were neurodevelopmental  disorders,  documented  neu- 
ropsychiatric  disorders,  neurologic  disorders,  diabetes,  or high-blood

pressure.  We included  the ﬁrst 100 subjects  that have structural  MRI 
data (55 females).  Of these 100 subjects,  95 subjects  have diﬀusion  data 
(52 females).  
Data acquisition  and estimation.  The HCP Young Adults dataset includes  
high resolution  T1-weighted  (T1w) and T2-weighted  (T2w) structural  
images (0.7 mm isotropic),  and multi-shell  high angular  resolution  diﬀu- 
sion imaging  (HARDI)  scans (1.25 mm isotropic,  90 diﬀusion  directions,  
b = 2000 mm/s 2 ), acquired  on a 3T connectome  scanner.  For further in- 
formation  and details of data acquisition  and processing  in this sam- 
ple, please see: https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-  
adult/document/1200-subjects-data-release  . 
T1w/T2w:  The ratio between  the T1-weighted  and T2-weighted  im- 
ages produces  a semi-quantitative  contrast,  as it removes  most of the 
shared biases of the images,  such as the receive-coil  inhomogeneities  
( Glasser  and Essen, 2011 ). 
To calculate  the fractional  anisotropy  (FA) along the midbrain  axes, 
we used the available  diﬀusion  data that had been processed  using the 
HCP preprocessing  pipeline  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). The preprocessing  
steps include  intensity  normalization  across runs, FSL’s TOPUP  algo- 
rithm for EPI distortion  correction,  FSL’s EDDY algorithm  for eddy cur- 
rent and motion correction,  gradient  nonlinearity  correction  and the 
registration  of mean b0 to native volume  T1w. We used CAMINO  to ﬁt 
a tensor to the preprocessed  data and extract an FA map for each subject

2.1.1. Participants  
We recruited  60 healthy  right-handed  college students.  The exclu- 
sion criteria  were as follows:  metallic  implants  in the body, claustro-  
phobia,  pregnancy,  history of psychiatric  disorders,  and medications  
aﬀecting  cognitive  function.  We assessed  these criteria  based on self- 
reported  information  from the participants.  All the participants  provided  
informed  consent.  Three participants  did not show up, and one could 
not undergo  fMRI scanning  due to technical  issues. Finally,  56 healthy  
college students  (20 women,  mean age: 21.0 ± 1.8 [18–26]  years) fully 
completed  the tasks. We performed  quality control testing on the brain 
images.  Six-dimensional  realignment  parameters  were used to calculate  
framewise  displacement  (FD) for each subject in each strategy.  FD cal- 
culation  was performed  using a formula  deﬁned  in a previous  study 
( Power et al., 2012 ). Data of ﬁve participants  with an average  FD greater 
than 0.3 mm in any strategy  were then excluded.  Additionally,  we ex- 
cluded the data of a participant  owing to a co-registration  error. Fi- 
nally, we included  data from 50 participants  (17 women,  21.1 ± 1.9 
[18–26]  years) in the analysis.  This study was approved  by the Insti- 
tutional  Review  Board of the Smart-Ageing  Research  Center of Tohoku  
University,  Japan, and was conducted  in accordance  with the Declara-  
tion of Helsinki.  
2.1.2. Stimuli 
A pilot study was conducted  to select visual stimuli for use in the 
fMRI task. We subjectively  chose 159 candidate  images that induce pos- 
itive emotions  as stimuli from a web-based  photo database  (photoAC:  
https://www.photo-ac.com/  ). Three hundred  participants  (128 women,

mean age: 40.2 ± 9.2 years), who did not participate  in the fMRI study, 
independently  participated  in the pilot study. Each participant  rated the 
valence  and arousal  for 53 images on a 9-point  scale (valence:  1 = very 
unpleasant,  5 = neutral,  9 = very pleasant;  arousal:  1 = calm, 9 = ex- 
cited). Each image was evaluated  by 100 participants.  Finally,  80 pleas- 
ant images (valence:  M = 6.68, SD = 0.43; arousal:  M = 4.64, SD = 0.63) 
with a valence  mean of 5.5 or higher were selected  in the order of lowest 
SD. 
2.1.3. Procedure  
After the participants  were explained  the purpose  of the present  
study and given a description  of the task and notes, they provided  in- 
formed  consent  and received  instructions  on emotion  regulation  strate- 
gies and several examples  of each strategy.  Subsequently,  they worked  
on an emotion  regulation  task using an MRI scanner.  The task comprised  
four conditions:  Watch, Attentional  Deployment,  Cognitive  Change,  and 
Response  Modulation.  At the end of every two conditions,  the partici-  
pants left the MRI scanner,  took a break, and were asked to grade how 
successfully  they could use the instructed  strategy  (1, not at all; 7, very 
much). For example,  some participants  completed  the Response  Modula-  
tion condition  and Cognitive  Change  condition,  after which they exited 
the MRI scanner.  After a break, they continued  with the Watch and At- 
tentional  Deployment  condition  ( Fig. 1 a). After completing  the study,

Stimuli  were presented  using PsychoPy  3 software  version  3.6.6 
( Peirce, 2007 ). In the Watch condition,  participants  were instructed  to 
“Look at the following  picture,  ”whereas  in the three emotion  regulation  
conditions,  they were asked to apply the instructed  strategy  to regulate  
their emotions.  The instructions  for Attentional  Deployment,  Cognitive  
Change,  and Response  Modulation  were “Pay attention  to your own pos- 
itive feelings,  ” “Imagine  that the situation  in the picture is happening  
to you, ”and “Express  your feelings  on your face, ”respectively.  The par- 
ticipants  were provided  with several examples  to ensure that they could 
regulate  their positive  emotions.  For example,  to increase  positive  emo- 
tions by using a picture of a wedding  ceremony,  the participants  paid 
attention  to their body’s reaction  and feelings  of mental satisfaction  (At- 
tentional  Deployment),  imagined  that they were the bride or groom 
(Cognitive  Change),  or smiled (Response  Modulation).  
Each condition  comprised  20 consecutive  trials (i.e., 20 trials for the 
Attentional  Deployment  condition  were conducted  sequentially).  At the 
beginning  of scanning,  the participants  were asked to rate the degree of 
positive  emotions  experienced  at that moment  on a 7-point  Likert scale, 
with 1 and 7 corresponding  to “not at all ”and “very much, ”respectively,  
using an MRI-compatible  seven-button  ﬁber-optic  response  box. Subse- 
quently,  a ﬁxation  cross appeared  on the screen for 1 s, followed  by an 
instruction  for 2 s and a picture for 8 s. While the image was displayed,  
participants  regulated  their emotions  using the instructed  strategy.  Af- 
ter the picture was presented,  the same question  regarding  the degree of 
positive  feelings  experienced  was presented  for 6 s. At the end of a trial, 
3  M. Tsujimoto,  T. Saito, Y. Matsuzaki  et al. NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119334 
participants  were asked to rest during the appearance  of a “Next ”mes- 
sage ( Fig. 1 b). For each participant,  the pictures  were randomly  assigned  
to four conditions,  and the order of the conditions  was randomized.  
2.1.5. Functional  imaging  
Image acquisition  was performed  using a T2-weighted  gradient-  
echo-planer  imaging  sequence  and a 3-Tesla  Philips Achieva  scan- 
ner (Philips,  Amsterdam,  Netherlands).  We acquired  32 whole-brain  
transaxial  images (time to echo = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 80°, slice thick- 
ness = 3.0 mm, slice gap = 0.5 mm, ﬁeld of view [FOV] = 192 mm, 
matrix = 64 ×64, voxel size = 3 ×3 ×3 mm) during all runs at a 
repetition  time of 2000 ms. Participants  engaged  in one of the four con- 
ditions during one functional  run, and 221 volumes  were acquired  in 
each run. Thus, we acquired  884 volumes  (221 volumes  ×4 runs) for 
each participant.  After all the runs, the T1-weighted  anatomical  images 
(thickness  = 1 mm, FOV = 240 mm, matrix = 240 ×240) were obtained  
for all participants  using a magnetization-prepared  rapid gradient-echo  
pulse sequence.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12332, 12337), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(7183, 7189), match='\n2.2. '>"

the Whitehall  II Study of British civil servants,  of which 775 received  an MRI scan ( Marmot  & Brunner,  2005 ). After quality control and 
exclusions  based on available  data, 398 participants  (mean age = 69.5 
years ± 4.2, 92 females)  were included  in the ﬁnal sample (Figure  S1).

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119728,"2.1. Linear regression  
The regression  method  used in encoding  models is often linear in 
the parameters.  Using linear regression  has several beneﬁts  compared  
to non-linear  regression.  The main beneﬁt is to only focus on explicit rep- 
resentations  ( Ivanova  et al., 2021; Kamitani  and Tong, 2005; Kriegesko-  
rte and Kievit, 2013; Naselaris  et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006; King et al., 
2018 ). With non-linear  regression,  some features  might be able to pre- 
dict brain activity  even though they do not explicitly  encode the same 
information  as the brain region (e.g. pixel features  do not explicitly  en- 
code the semantic  content  of an image, even though semantic  content  
can be extracted  from the pixels).  Restricting  the regression  method  to 
be linear is thus a way to only consider  features  that explicitly  represent  
brain activity.  Additionally,  linearity  enables  the use of various  meth- 
ods to interpret  the regression  model, such as variance  partitioning  or 
feature importance  methods  (see Section  2.5 ). Finally,  linear regression  
methods  are computationally  eﬃcient  and robust to small sample sizes 
that are common  in neuroimaging  studies.  Note that encoding  models 
that use linear regression  are sometimes  called linearized  encoding  mod- 
els ( Naselaris  et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006 ), to emphasize  that feature 
extraction  can be non-linear.  
Mathematically,  let us note 𝑋 ∈ℝ 𝑛 ×𝑝 the matrix of features,  with 𝑛 
samples  and 𝑝 features,  and 𝑦 ∈ℝ 𝑛 the brain activity  vector (or target 
vector).  Linear regression  seeks a weight vector 𝑏 ∈ℝ 𝑝 such that the 
target vector is approximated  as a linear combination  of the features  
𝑦 ≈𝑋𝑏 . It is standard  to model the error as additive  Gaussian  white 
noise, so that 𝑦 = 𝑋𝑏 + 𝜀 , with a noise vector 𝜀 ∈ℝ 𝑛 drawn from a cen- 
tered Gaussian  distribution.  (The Gaussian  assumption  is reasonable  for 
de-trended  fMRI recordings,  but might not be valid for single-trial  neu- 
rophysiology).  This regression  method  is called ordinary  least squares , 
and can be written  as an optimization  problem  
𝑏 ∗ = argmin 
𝑏 ||𝑦 − 𝑋𝑏 ||2 
2 , (1) 
where ||𝑎 ||2 
2 = ∑
𝑖 𝑎 2 
𝑖 is the squared  𝐿 2 norm. 
The main limitation  of ordinary  least squares  is that it is unstable  
in some situations.  To understand  this issue, note that solving  ordinary  
least squares  amounts  to inverting  the eigenvalues  𝜎𝑖 of the matrix 𝑋 ⊤𝑋.

Fig. 1. Overview  of the encoding  model framework.  (a) The encoding  model framework  uses a regression  model to predict a brain activity 𝑦 ∈ℝ 𝑛 with features  
𝑋 ∈ℝ 𝑛 ×𝑝 extracted  from the stimulus  (or task). The regression  model is usually linear (see Section 2.1 ), 𝑦 ≈𝑋𝑏 , with a weight vector 𝑏 ∈ℝ 𝑝 . Regularization  can be 
also used to improve  the regression  model (see Section 2.2 ). (b) A cornerstone  of the encoding  model framework  is the separation  of the data into a train set and 
a test set. The regression  model is ﬁt on the train set only. Then, the ﬁt model is used to predict brain activity on the test set. Finally, the prediction  accuracy  is 
evaluated  on the test set by comparing  the prediction  vector with the recorded  brain activity.  The prediction  accuracy  is quantiﬁed  for instance  with the 𝑅 2 score, 
which can be interpreted  as the explained  variance  (see Section 2.3 ). (c) When multiple  feature spaces are available,  a separate  model can be ﬁt on each feature 
space, to compare  the prediction  accuracy  of each model (see Section 2.4 ). However,  considering  only the best-predicting  feature space ignores the possibility  that 
feature spaces can be complementary.  (d) To take into account complementarity  between  feature spaces, a joint regression  can be ﬁt on multiple  feature spaces 
simultaneously.  The feature spaces are concatenated  into a large feature matrix 𝑋, and a single weight vector 𝑏 is learned.  (e) Then, the prediction  vector 𝑦 can be 
decomposed  into a sum of partial predictions  from each feature space 𝑦 𝑖 = 𝑋 𝑖 𝑏 𝑖 . Finally, the explained  variance  𝑅 2 can be decomposed  into the contribution  of each 
feature space (see Section 2.5 ), for instance  using the product measure  (see Section 2.6 ) or variance  partitioning  (see Section 2.7 ). 
When features  are correlated,  some eigenvalues  can be small, which re- 
duces the stability  of the inversion  (a small change in the features  can 
have a large eﬀect on the result). In some cases, some eigenvalues  can 
even be equal to zero, which makes the inversion  ill-deﬁned.  Eigenval-  
ues equal to zero can arise when some features  are fully redundant  (e.g. 
one feature being the sum of two other features),  or when the number  of 
independent  features  is greater than the number  of samples  ( 𝑝 > 𝑛 ). The 
system is then called underdetermined,  and the optimization  problem  
has inﬁnitely  many solutions,  of which most do not generalize  well to 
new data. To solve these issues, ordinary  least squares  can be extended  
into ridge regression  ( Hoerl and Kennard,  1970 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12134, 12139), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5280, 5286), match='\n2.2. '>"

The present  research  uses cross-sectional  data preprocessed  by 
the Lifespan  HCP study team and downloaded  in March 2021 as 
part of the 2.0 Data Release  for the HCP-Development  ( www.hcp-  
development.org  ) and HCP-Aging  ( www.hcp-aging.org  ) studies.  The 
two samples  described  below reﬂect the largest number  of biologically  
unrelated  participants  who provided  good quality data on all the vari- 
ables of interest.  We only included  female participants  because  self- 
report measures  of biological  aging were unavailable  for the males in the 
HCP-Aging  sample.  All participants  were screened  for a history of neuro- 
logical,  psychiatric,  endocrine,  genetic  and other serious medical  (e.g., 
diabetes,  two or more seizures)  disorders,  use of psychotropic  drugs, 
head injuries  with loss of consciousness  and/or change in mental func- 
tioning,  and other conditions  or bodily implants  that may render their 
participation  unsafe. Table 1 contains  demographic  information  on both

A cohort of right-handed  ( Oldﬁeld,  1971 ) adults aged between  19 
and 80 years of age was recruited  from Leuven  and surrounding  region 
to take part in the study. The study was approved  by the local Medical  
Ethics Committee  of KU Leuven  (study number:  S60428)  in accordance  
with the Declaration  of Helsinki  and its amendments  ( World-Medical-  
Association  1964 , 2008 ). All participants  provided  written  informed  Table 1

a brain lesion, 2 participants  did not reach the cutoﬀ score  ( > 24) on 
the Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA)  ( Nasreddine  et al., 2005 ), 
and the remaining  6 were excluded  due to excessive  motion during the 
resting state fMRI scan (average  framewise  displacement  higher than 
0.3mm).  Thus, data from 92 participants  were ﬁnally analyzed  in this 
study, divided  in four age groups in age increments  of 15 years based 
on an approximately  even distribution  of the full age range present  in

The data used in this study were provided  by the Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP; Van Essen et al., 2013 ). While the HCP dataset in- 
cludes over 1000 participants,  only a subset of 184 participants  were 
scanned  during naturalistic  stimuli viewing,  from which 175 partici-  
pants were reported  by the HCP to have good quality data. Naturalistic  
stimuli fMRI scans were performed  on a 7 Tesla Siemens  Magnetom.  
Since this work focuses  on naturalistic  stimuli,  we used this subset of 
participants  for whom naturalistic  viewing  data were available.  Besides  
movie-watching  scans, these participants  were also scanned  at rest on 
both 7T and 3T scanners,  and during task performance  on a 3T scan- 
ner. Participants  that did not complete  all movie-watching,  resting-state  
and task fMRI scans were excluded  from this study, resulting  in a ﬁnal 
dataset of n = 153 (mean age = 29.5, standard  deviation  = 3.24, 94

ing in healthy  adults, we performed  a comprehensive  search using the 
following  electronic  databases:  PsycINFO  (OVID),  Medline  (PubMed),  
Scopus (Academic  Search Complete),  Web of Science  Core Collection  
(Web of Science),  IEEE Xplore Digital Library  (IEEE Xplore),  as well 
as ProQuest  (for grey literature  involving  materials  published  outside  
of traditional  publication  channels  such as preprints)  between  June 4 th 
and 5 th 2021. Only empirical  articles  written  in English  were consid-  
ered, and no restrictions  were applied  on publication  dates. Search terms 
were derived  from the two core concepts  in our review,  mind wander-  
ing and EEG, and were restricted  to the Title, Keywords,  and Abstract  
sections  in our search. Mind wandering  terms included  “mind wander-  
ing ”, “task-unrelated  thought  ”, “stimulus-independent  thought  ”, “oﬀ- 
task state ”, “spontaneous  thought  ”, and “internal  attention  ”. These were 
searched  in conjunction  with EEG terms, which included  “EEG ”, “elec- 
troencephalogram  ”, “event-related  potentials  ”or “ERP ”, “event-related  
spectral  perturbation  ”or “ERSP ”, “frequency  power ”, “oscillatory  activ- 
ity ”, “delta ”, “theta ”, “alpha ”, “beta ”, and “gamma  ”. Search syntax and 
strategies  were tailored  to each search engine to ensure all search terms 
and their variations  were considered.  To ensure literature  saturation,  
we also reviewed  the reference  section of all included  articles  as well as 
related major systematic  reviews  or meta-analyses.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11020, 11025), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1674, 1680), match='\n2.2. '>"

2.1.1. Participants  
We made use of the second data release provided  by the 
Developing  Human  Connectome  Project (dHCP;  http://www.  
developingconnectome.org/project/  ), which in total includes  more 
than 500 neonatal  MRI data sets and is publicly  accessible  after 
registration.  The dHCP aims to create a dynamic  map of early human 
brain connectivity.  Main inclusion  criteria  were infants born between  
23 and 44 weeks of gestational  age (GA). Main exclusion  criteria  were 
contraindications  to MRI and health conditions  unsuitable  for MRI 
scanning  despite neonatal  care. Further  information  regarding  inclusion  
and exclusion  criteria  can be found on the dHCP webpage  (retrieved  
November  30, 2020, from http://www.developingconnectome.org/  ). 
We analyzed  data from infants born between  37 and 42 weeks GA 
and scanned  between  37 and 44 weeks of postmenstrual  age (PMA),  
for whom structural  and DWI data sets were available  along with 
radiological  scores = < 4 (i.e. image quality).  Radiological  scores of 3 
are said to potentially  inﬂuence  imaging  analysis  due to the presence  
of focal and punctate  lesions.  However,  we decided  to include  these 
participants  considering  the nature of our study, namely  tractography  
analysis  and tract-constrained  averages  of diﬀusion  metrics.  Data sets 
rated with a radiological  score of 4 were also included,  as these are 
described  to have unlikely  analysis  signiﬁcance  (for a brief description  
of radiological  scores see the dHCP release notes ). After rejecting  data 
sets not ﬁtting these criteria,  the ﬁnal sample consisted  of N = 311 new- 
borns (141 females).  Further  information  of the participants  included  
in this study is presented  in Table 1 . 
2.1.2. Neonatal  MRI data acquisition,  preprocessing  and microstructural  
models 
Image acquisition  was conducted  at the Evelina  Newborn  Imaging  
center, St Thomas’  Hospital,  London,  UK, using a 3T Philips Achieva  
MRI scanner  and a dedicated  neonatal  imaging  system including  a 32 
channel  head coil. In all but six cases, infants were scanned  without  
sedation.  A complete  individual  imaging  session included  calibration,  
anatomical  (T1w and T2w), resting-state  fMRI and DWI scans, resulting  
in around one hour of total imaging  time. T2w and inversion  recovery  
T1w multi-slice  fast spin-echo  images were acquired  in sagittal  and ax- 
ial slice stacks with 0.8 ×0.8 m m 2 of in-plane  resolution  and 1.6 mm slice thickness  with 0.8 mm or 0.74 mm (only for in T1w Sagittal)  over- 
lap. Other parameters  for T1w and T2w images were 4795/8.7  ms and 
12,000/156  ms TR/TE,  respectively.  DWI data was acquired  using an 
optimized  set of directions  in four shells with b-values  of 0, 400, 1000 
and 2600 and split into four optimal  subsets corresponding  to diﬀerent  
Phase Encoding  directions.  In-plane  image resolution  was 1.5 ×1.5 m m 2 
and slices were 3 mm thick with 1.5 mm overlap.  TR and TE were 3800 
and 90 ms, respectively.  Additional  imaging  procedures  and acquisition  
parameters  for all modalities  can be found on the oﬃcial dHCP data re- 
lease documents  and the literature  describing  further image processing  
( Bastiani  et al., 2019 ; Makropoulos  et al., 2018 ). 
Structural  and DWI raw data followed  preprocessing  pipelines  devel- 
oped by the dHCP. These pipelines  were speciﬁcally  designed  to address  
challenges  intrinsic  to neonatal  MRI, considering  the vast diﬀerences  be- 
tween adult and neonatal  brain-tissue  properties.  In brief, the structural  
preprocessing  pipeline  ( Makropoulos  et al., 2018 ) reconstructs  struc- 
tural images,  performs  motion correction,  bias correction  and brain ex- 
traction.  Images are then segmented  into diﬀerent  tissue types (e.g., 
white matter,  gray matter)  and labeled  accordingly.  Next, cortical  white 
matter and pial surfaces  are extracted  and projected  to spheres  for reg- 
istration  purposes.  Finally,  descriptors  of cortical  characteristics,  for in- 
stance myelin maps, are generated.  Both volumetric  and surface ﬁles are 
provided  by the dHCP and were used in the present  study. The diﬀusion  
preprocessing  pipeline  ( Bastiani  et al., 2019 ) initially  selects the best b0 
images per phase encoding  direction  and estimates  the ﬁeldmap.  These 
are then used to correct the 4D dMRI data for susceptibility-induced  
distortions,  Eddy currents  and motion.  Further  steps include  a super- 
resolution  algorithm  and registration  estimates  between  diﬀusion  and 
anatomical  spaces. In the present  study we made use of preprocessed  
4D dMRI and structural  data, as well as the transformation  matrices  
resulting  from registration  between  diﬀusion  and structural  individual  
spaces. We used the Diﬀusion  MRI tools (FDT) in the FMRIB Software  
Library  (FSL version  6.0.3; fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/)  to ﬁt a tensor model to 
the preprocessed  dMRI data (DTFIT)  and obtain diﬀusion  metrics  (FA, 
MD, AD and RD). Next, Bayesian  Estimation  of Diﬀusion  Parameters  
obtained  using Sampling  Techniques  (BEDPOSTX)  was applied  to the 
entire data set ( Behrens  et al., 2007 ; Sotiropoulos  et al., 2016 ). This 
tool generates  voxel-wise  distributions  on diﬀusion  parameters  and is 
necessary  for further probabilistic  tractography.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(16491, 16496), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5456, 5462), match='\n2.2. '>"

trait anxiety  levels in each participant  using Spielberger’s  Trait Anxiety

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119027,"2.1. The triaxial sensor 
The triaxial  sensor ( www.quspin.com  ; Osborne  et al., (2020) ) is a sin- 
gle self-contained  unit ( Fig. 2 a) comprising:  1) a glass cell (3x 3x 3 mm 3 ) 
housing  a mixture  of 87 Rb vapour and buﬀer gas (nitrogen),  2) a single 
laser diode tuned to the D1 transition  of 87 Rb (795-nm  wavelength),  
with associated  optics to circularly  polarise  the light generated,  3) two 
independent  photodetectors  and 4) three orthogonal  pairs of electro-  
magnetic  coils to control magnetic  ﬁeld inside the cell. The laser beam 
is projected  through  a beam splitter and the two resultant  beams are 
shone through  the cell in orthogonal  directions  ( Fig. 1 a). Care is taken 
to ensure that the two beams have a minimal  overlap  (spatial  separation  
∼0.65 ± 0.25 mm). The buﬀer gas minimises  collisions  between  the Rb 
atoms and the cell wall, and minimises  diﬀusion  of the polarised  atoms 
between  the beams (the diﬀusion  length over the ∼3-ms coherence  time 
(i.e., the time the atoms stay polarised)  is < 1 mm). Independent  pho- 
todetectors  detect the amplitude  of light from both beams, after passing  
through  the cell. The two beams optically  pump the Rb atoms and, in a 
zero-ﬁeld  environment,  the magnetic  moments  of atoms align with the 
beam orientation  ( Fig. 1 a). The bulk magnetisation  of the atoms inter- 
acts with external  magnetic  ﬁelds and evolves  according  to the Bloch 
equations.  
The vapour cell is enclosed  in a set of three axis coils ( Fig. 1 b). 
These not only help to ensure zero ﬁeld inside the cell (by nulling 
any residual  static bias ﬁeld inside the cell), but also provide  oscillat-  
ing modulation  ﬁelds to enable lock-in ampliﬁer-based  signal process-  
ing. Take the example  of Beam 1 (travelling  in the z direction  through  
the cell); we assume  that we want to measure  a ﬁeld, 𝐵 𝑦 , oriented  in 
the y direction,  and to do so we apply a modulation  ﬁeld, of a form 
𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑦 = 𝐵 1 sin ( 2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ) , also in the y direction.  𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 is the modulation  
frequency  (typically  ∼1 kHz) and t represents  time. The solution  to the 
Bloch equations  shows that the polarisation  of atoms in the beam path 
is given by ( Cohen-Tannoudji  et al., 1970 ) 
𝑃 𝑧 = 𝑃 0 𝐽 0 ( 𝛾𝐵 1 
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 ) 
𝐽 1 ( 𝛾𝐵 1 
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 ) 𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ). (1)

Fig. 1. Schematic  of the triaxial OPM. a) A single laser, coupled with a beam splitter, allows two independent,  circularly-polarised  795 nm wavelength  laser beams 
to be projected  through  a 87 Rb cell. Both independently  facilitate  optical pumping.  b) On-board  sensor coils provide modulation  ﬁelds in the x, y and z directions.  A 
ﬁeld along the axis of a beam has no eﬀect on the atoms. Consequently,  only two orthogonal  modulation  signals (sine waves with 0°and 90°phase  shifts) are needed 
to read out signals in three orthogonal  orientations.  c) Schematic  illustrations  of the eﬀect of three external  (e.g. neuromagnetic)  ﬁelds: the atoms in the path of 
Beam 1 are sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in x and y. The atoms in the path of Beam 2 are sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in y and z. 
Here, 𝑃 0 is the eﬀective  equilibrium  polarisation  of the cell following  
optical pumping.  𝛾is the gyromagnetic  ratio and 𝜏represents  a time 
constant  governing  relaxation  of polarisation  to equilibrium.  𝐽 0 and 𝐽 1 
are Bessel functions  of the ﬁrst kind which, in this case, collapse  to con- 
stants. The signal measured  at photodetector  1, 𝑉 1 , is directly  propor-  
tional to 𝑃 𝑧 , such that 
𝑉 1 ∝𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 ). (2) 
A lock-in ampliﬁer  can then be used to eliminate  the sinusoidal  mod- 
ulation (and increase  SNR), leaving  a signal which is proportional  to 
𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏
1+ ( 𝛾𝐵 𝑦 𝜏) 2 . Consequently,  𝑉 1 is approximately  linear with ﬁeld around 
𝐵 𝑦 = 0 . This allows inference  on the ﬁeld of interest,  𝐵 𝑦 . 
In a similar way, we could measure  a ﬁeld oriented  in the x direction,  
since symmetry  suggests  the solutions  to the Bloch equations  would be 
identical,  as long as the modulation  ﬁeld is also oriented  along the x 
direction.  However,  it is equally  possible  to measure  the two ﬁelds ( 𝐵 𝑦 
and 𝐵 𝑥 ) simultaneously  by applying  𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑦 and 𝐵 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑥 modulation  ﬁelds 
at the same time. The two modulation  ﬁelds can be applied  at the same 
frequency  and the 𝐵 𝑥 and 𝐵 𝑦 measurements  separated  by adding a 90°
phase lag between  x and y modulation  currents.  In such a scheme,  we 
get two superimposed  signals at the photodetector,  the ﬁrst given by Eq. 
(2 ), and the second by 
𝑉 2 ∝𝛾𝐵 𝑥 𝜏
1 + (𝛾𝐵 𝑥 𝜏)2 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (
2 𝜋𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑡 + 𝜋
2 )
. (3) 
The orthogonality  of the sine terms, imposed  by the phase oﬀset, enables  
a lock-in ampliﬁer  to detect both signals independently.  In this way, one 
can measure  ﬁeld at two orientations,  with a single beam. 
For the triaxial  sensor, we have two beams which are probed by two 
photodetectors,  independently.  Beam 1 is sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in 
x and y (but not z ). Beam 2 is sensitive  to ﬁelds oriented  in y and z (but 
not x ). This is shown schematically  in Fig. 1 c. Note that the addition  
of a modulation  ﬁeld along the orientation  of the laser beam has no ﬁrst-order  eﬀect on the atoms, and so we can use the same modulation  
frequency  and phase for the x and z directions  as the atoms in Beam 1 
are largely unimpacted  by the z modulation  ﬁeld and the atoms in Beam 
2 are similarly  unaﬀected  by the x modulation  ﬁeld. The result is two 
independent  measures  of 𝐵 𝑦 (which are averaged  together)  alongside  
a single, simultaneous,  measurement  of 𝐵 𝑥 and 𝐵 𝑧 . Combining  these 
provides  a complete  triaxial  ﬁeld characterisation.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12416, 12421), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5860, 5866), match='\n2.2. '>"

Description  and Importance  : 
2  C.M.W. Tax, M. Bastiani, J. Veraart et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118830 
Diﬀusion  MR images of the head contain  not only the brain (here as- 
sumed to be the organ of interest),  but also other structures  such as the 
skin, skull, eyes, meninges,  cranial nerves and face muscles.  Brain ex- 
traction  algorithms  allow the removal  of these structures  from the data 
to potentially  improve  the reliability  of further preprocessing  steps, such 
as tissue segmentation  or cross-modal  registration,  in addition  to reduc- 
ing the computational  demands  of any subsequent  analyses  as these can 
be constrained  to the voxels of interest.  For example,  using an imperfect  
mask can lead to the inclusion  of voxels with spuriously  high fractional  
anisotropy  (FA) at the periphery  of the brain, which might bias further 
registration  or analysis  steps. 
Approaches  prior to and brought  by the HCP : 
Brain extraction  in dMRI can take advantage  of the skull, fat and 
muscle tissue having considerably  lower signal intensity  than the brain 
in fat-suppressed  EPI acquisitions.  Therefore,  the problem  can be for- 
mulated  as a standard  image processing  background/foreground  seg- 
mentation.  The well-known  Otsu histogram  thresholding  technique  
( Otsu, 1979 ) can be retroﬁtted  to this problem  to ﬁnd the optimal  sig- 
nal threshold  that separates  the brain from non-brain  regions  and is the 
brain extraction  algorithm  of choice in multiple  preprocessing  pipelines  
( Garyfallidis  et al., 2014 ). 
Another  popular  technique,  FSL’s Brain Extraction  Tool (BET) 
( Smith, 2002 ), is widely used across diﬀerent  imaging  modalities,  in- 
cluding  dMRI. BET makes mild assumptions  about the shape of the 
brain and it radially  projects  beams from an initial center position  onto 
a small centered  spherical  mesh, until the beams reach large intensity  
gradients.  The slowly growing  mesh is updated  iteratively  to accom-  
modate  the shape of the brain. A similar approach.  AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip  
( Cox, 1996 ) ﬁrst removes  gross spatial image nonuniformities  and repo- 
sitions the brain to a more convenient  orientation  and subsequently  ap- 
plies a modiﬁed  version  of BET for brain extraction.  For dMRI datasets,  
these methods  are most typically  performed  on the ﬁrst non-diﬀusion-  
weighted  𝑏 = 0 𝑠 ∕ 𝑚𝑚 2 image (referred  as the 𝑏 = 0 image throughout  
this manuscript).  
Another  category  of brain extraction  techniques  nonlinearly  register  
the 𝑏 = 0 image to one or multiple  brain templates  (or vice versa) for 
which segmentation  or tissue probability  maps have been pre-generated.  
These template-based  brain extraction  methods  subsequently  perform  a 
voting procedure  that decides  whether  a voxel belongs  to the foreground  
or background.  BEaST ( Eskildsen  et al., 2012 ) and ALFA ( Serag et al., 
2016 ) are examples  that use multiple  templates  to statistically  improve  
the voting process.  
Diﬀusion  MRI-speciﬁc  methods  leverage  the properties  of the dMRI 
signal by ﬁtting a diﬀusion  model to the data and using the derived  
measures  for brain extraction.  One of the ﬁrst measures  adopted  in 
this context  is Quantitative  Anisotropy  proposed  for Generalized  Q- 
Sampling  Imaging  (GQI) ( Yeh et al., 2010 ) but can be generalized  to 
any model computing  orientation  distribution  functions  (ODF) (e.g. DSI 
( Wedeen  et al., 2005 )). The properties  of quantitative  anisotropy  in the 
brain and the background  regions  are suﬃciently  diﬀerent  that a single 
threshold  is often adequate  to remove  the nonbrain  areas. 
Novel strategies  : 
Diﬀerent  types of deep learning  architectures  such as convolution  
neural networks  (CNNs)  ( Kleesiek  et al., 2016 ) or U-Nets ( Wang et al., 
2020b ) have recently  been proposed  for brain extraction.  In addition  
to deep learning-based  segmentation,  traditional  machine  learning  clas- 
siﬁers such as random  forests have been used to segment  dMRI data 
into intracranial,  brain, and cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF) masks ( Reid et al., 
2018 ). 
Practical  considerations  : 
Brain extraction  quite commonly  requires  user intervention  in the 
form of 𝑏 = 0 image selection,  quality checking,  and/or parameter  opti- 
mization.  Brain extraction  is typically  performed  on the ﬁrst 𝑏 = 0 im- 
age, however,  any artifacts  deteriorating  its quality will also impact its 
performance.  Since such a reference  image is often used for multiple  
preprocessing  steps (e.g. motion correction,  see Section  2.8 ) it is good practice  to select images with minimal  artifacts  for brain extraction  ei- 
ther manually  or automatically  ( Bastiani  et al., 2019b ). However,  even 
with adequate  data the extraction  algorithm  can generate  unsatisfac-  
tory results (e.g. in the case of low signal intensities),  and therefore  the 
quality of the extracted  brain masks should be checked.  Several  brain 
extraction  algorithms  are designed  for in vivo human brain data and are 
not directly  applicable  to other organs or species and/or require  exten- 
sive parameter  tuning.  
The Otsu technique  assumes  a bimodal  signal distribution  and can be 
sensitive  to noise in the data. It is therefore  commonly  performed  after 
the application  of a median  ﬁlter which removes  spurious  intensities  
( Garyfallidis  et al., 2014 ) to increase  its accuracy.  As it does not rely 
on a priori brain shape information,  it can more readily be applied  to 
brains of other species.  In contrast,  FSL’s BET and AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip  
(in its default setting),  have a priori assumptions  on the brain shape and 
can not directly  be applied  to other organs or species.  Additionally,  the 
performance  of BET relies on the accuracy  of the center estimation  and 
the validity  of its uniform  intensity  assumption.  
The registration  quality of the brain outline in template-based  ex- 
traction  methods  is of fundamental  importance  for its accuracy.  The 
machine  learning  methods  depend  quite strongly  on the size and the 
representation  power of the training  dataset.  Accurate  segmentation  is 
further challenged  by pathology  in clinical  datasets,  for example  in trau- 
matic brain injury (TBI) patients  (see Lutkenhoﬀet  al. (2014) ). 
Brain extraction  is generally  performed  early in the pipeline  as other 
steps can require  a mask (e.g. signal drift correction  ( Section  2.3 ) and 
motion/eddy  current  correction  ( Sections  2.7 and 2.9 )). However,  com- 
putation  of a brain mask prior to susceptibility  distortion  correction  
( Section  2.11 ) can lead to inaccurate  results,  as signal pile-up and signal- 
reduction  can confuse  brain extraction  approaches.  In addition,  the 
mask will suﬀer from the same geometric  distortions  as the uncorrected  
𝑏 = 0 image, which for example  complicates  registration  to anatomi-  
cal T1 weighted  images.  Furthermore,  brain extraction  prior to motion 
correction  and eddy current  distortion  correction  may lead to subopti-  
mal masking  of diﬀusion-weighted  images (DWIs) as they are aﬀected  
by translations/rotations  and geometrical  distortions  compared  to the 
ﬁrst 𝑏 = 0 image. Therefore,  brain extraction  can be performed  at mul- 
tiple stages in the pipeline,  and it is good practice  to compute  an up- 
dated mask after preprocessing  and prior to further analysis  steps such 
as model ﬁtting, spatial normalization,  and registration  to anatomical  
images.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9632, 9637), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(7675, 7681), match='\n2.2. '>"

The subject-level  surface-based  spatial Bayesian  (SBSB) GLM pro- 
posed by Mejia et al. (2020b)  consists  of two stages: model estimation  
and identifying  areas of activation.  Fig. 1 illustrates  both stages in con- 
trast with the classical  GLM. Below, we describe  each stage brieﬂy,  in- 
cluding  our novel multi-run  extension.  The SBSB GLM also allows for 
computationally  eﬃcient  group-level  estimation,  described  below. For 
more details on the mathematical  construction  and Bayesian  compu-  
tation of the SBSB model, see Mejia et al. (2020b)  . The Bernstein-von  
Mises theorem,  which gives asymptotic  guarantees  concerning  conver-  
gence for Bayesian  models,  holds in the Bayesian  implementation  of the 
model as long as regularity  conditions  about the mean are met and the 
model itself is not misspeciﬁed  ( Van der Vaart, 2000 ). The INLA ap- 
proach centers the posterior  around the maximum  likelihood  estimator  
with covariance  equal to the inverse  Fisher information  matrix using a 
normal  prior distribution  as the sample size approaches  inﬁnity.  This 
satisﬁes  the regularity  conditions  imposed  by the Bernstein-von  Mises 
Theorem  because  the density  function  is continuous  and twice diﬀeren-  
tiable everywhere.  Please see Van der Vaart (2000) for further details 
about the conditions  of the Bernstein-von  Mises theorem.  
2.1.1. Single-subject  modeling  
Single-run  model.  Let 𝑁be the number  of vertices  on the cortical  
surface where BOLD signal is measured,  and let 𝑇 be the duration  of the 
fMRI timeseries.  The classical  GLM ( Friston et al., 1995 ) adapted  to the 
cortical  surface is based on ﬁtting a separate  regression  model at each 
vertex. In each model, the response  is the observed  BOLD activity,  and 
the predictors  are the expected  BOLD response  due to each of 𝐾tasks 
or stimuli,  which is constructed  by convolving  the timeseries  of stim- 
ulus presentation  with a haemodynamic  response  function  (HRF). For 
simplicity,  assume  that nuisance  signals (e.g. head motion parameters,  
drift) have been regressed  from both the response  and task predictors,  
and assume  that the data has been prewhitened  to remove  temporal

Fig. 1. The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM compared  with the classical  GLM. Both GLMs consist of two stages: (1) estimating  activation  amplitude  and (2) 
identifying  areas of activation.  At stage 1, the Bayesian  GLM incorporates  spatial dependence  and performs  shrinkage  of background  locations  through  a prior on 
𝜷, resulting  in smoother  and more reliable estimates  of activation,  given by the maximum-a-posteriori  (MAP) value from the posterior  distribution  of 𝜷. At stage 2, 
the Bayesian  GLM identiﬁes  the collection  of vertices with activation  amplitude  above a speciﬁed  eﬀect size, based on joint posterior  probabilities.  This results in 
greater power to detect true activations.  
autocorrelation  in the model residuals  and to eliminate  spatial hetero- 
geneity  in the residual  variance.  Then, the classical  GLM at vertex 𝑣 can 
be represented  as 
𝐲 𝑣 = 𝐗 𝑣 𝜷𝑣 + 𝝐𝑣 , (1) 
where 𝐲 𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝑇 is the observed  BOLD timeseries,  𝐗 𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝑇×𝐾 contains  the 
expected  response  to each of the 𝐾stimuli,  𝜷𝑣 ∈ℝ 𝐾 are the coeﬃcient  
values representing  the activation  amplitude  for each stimulus  at a sin- 
gle vertex 𝑣 , and 𝝐𝑣 𝑖𝑛𝑑 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑇 ) are white-noise  residuals.  Note 
that 𝐗 𝑣 may vary across vertices  due to prewhitening,  which involves  
pre-multiplying  the original  design matrix by a vertex-speciﬁc  whiten-  
ing matrix.  If no prewhitening  is performed,  then 𝐗 1 = ⋯ = 𝐗 𝑁 . While 
computationally  convenient  and simple,  ﬁtting thousands  of separate  
models is clearly suboptimal,  since neighboring  vertices  are known to 
exhibit similar patterns  of task activation.  If these similarities  are not 
explicitly  modeled,  the estimates  of activation  will contain  high levels 
of noise due to reduced  statistical  eﬃciency.  
A spatial Bayesian  GLM addresses  this by treating  the image of ac- 
tivation  amplitudes  in response  to task 𝑘 , 𝜷𝑘 = ( 𝛽1 𝑘 , …, 𝛽𝑁𝑘 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁 , as 
a latent ﬁeld across the 𝑁data locations,  and assuming  a spatial prior 
to incorporate  prior knowledge  of local spatial dependence  and spar- 
sity ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM pro- 
posed by Mejia et al. (2020b)  makes use of a particular  class of Gaussian  
Markov  Random  Field (GMRF)  priors called stochastic  partial diﬀeren-  
tial equation  (SPDE) priors, which approximate  a continuous  Matérn  
random  ﬁeld by a GMRF ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2013; Lindgren  et al., 
2011 ). SPDE priors are particularly  well-suited  to model cs-fMRI  data 
for several reasons:  they have sparse precision  (required  for high di- mensional  contexts),  they are built on a triangular  mesh (the format of 
cs-fMRI  data, see Appendix  Fig. A.2 ), they have two separate  parame-  
ters to control the scale and the smoothness,  they are invariant  to ﬁnite 
resamplings,  and the parameters  are interpretable  given the relation-  
ship with the Matérn  covariance  function.  The SPDE prior in ℝ 𝑑 uses 
the Matérn  kernel to inform the spatial covariance  for the latent ﬁeld of 
task coeﬃcients.  The Matérn  covariance  for a pair of vertices  𝐮 and 𝐯 is 
a function  of their distance  ||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||, and is explicitly  deﬁned  as: 
cov ( 𝐮 , 𝐯 ) = 𝜎2 ( 𝜅||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||) 𝐾 1 ( 𝜅||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||) , 
where 𝜎2 > 0 is the variance  and 𝐾 1 ( ⋅) is the modiﬁed  Bessel function  
of the second kind of order 1, which decreases  rapidly  as the distance  
between  two vertices  increases.  Performing  all of the distance  calcula-  
tions for large datasets  is computationally  infeasible,  as the covariance  
matrix is dense and diﬃcult  to invert. Lindgren  et al. (2011) solved this 
problem  by deriving  an explicit  GMRF representation  through  solving  
the SPDE 
( 𝜅2 − Δ) 𝛼∕2 ( 𝜏𝛽( 𝐮 )) = ( 𝐮 ) , 𝐮 ∈ℝ 𝑑 , 
where Δ= ∑𝑑 
𝑖 =1 𝜕 2 ∕ 𝜕𝑢 2 
𝑖 is the Laplacian  operator,  𝛼aﬀects the smooth-  
ness, and 𝜏aﬀects the variance.  In order to obtain a Markov  struc- 
ture, we approximate  using the basis expansion  𝛽( 𝐮 ) ≈∑𝑛 
𝑖 =1 𝜓 𝑖 ( 𝐮 ) 𝑤 𝑖 (see 
Mejia et al. (2020b)  for further details).  It is important  to note that 
||𝐮 − 𝐯 ||represents  the geodesic  distance  between  vertices  𝐮 and 𝐯 , and 
not the Euclidean  distance.  The geodesic  distances  are found using the 
subject-speciﬁc  cortical  surfaces  and takes the folded geometry  of the 
cortex into account  to ﬁnd the distance  along the surface.  An SPDE prior

for a given Gaussian  process  𝜷takes the form 
𝜷= 𝚿𝐰 , 𝐰 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅,𝜏) , (2) 
𝐐 𝜅,𝜏= 𝜏2 ( 𝜅4 𝐂 + 2 𝜅2 𝐆 + 𝐆𝐂 −1 𝐆 ) , (3) 
where 𝚿is an 𝑁 ×𝑛 indicator  matrix in which element  𝜓 𝑖,𝑗 = 1 when 
data location  𝑖 corresponds  to vertex 𝑗, and 0 for all 𝜓 𝑖,𝑗 ′, where 𝑗 ≠𝑗 ′. 
Often, 𝚿is an identity  matrix because  cortical  surface data locations  
are already  on a mesh. However,  in some cases, the mesh may contain  
additional  locations  to satisfy shape and size constraints  and boundary  
locations  to improve  estimation  along the data boundary.  In our study, 
the cortical  surface geometry  is stored in the form of a triangular  mesh, 
and so a mesh does not need to be constructed.  However,  in the case 
when no cortical  surface geometry  is available,  an automated  procedure  
to construct  a mesh on ℝ , ℝ 2 , or a sphere is implemented  in the R-INLA  
package  Martins  et al. (2013) , which maximizes  the minimum  interior  
angle of the mesh triangles  to make transitions  between  small and large 
triangles  as smooth  as possible.  Please see Mejia et al. (2020b)  for fur- 
ther details on the construction  of the mesh and 𝚿. In the SBSB GLM, 
additional  mesh locations  consist of the medial wall, which serves as a 
supplemental  layer to improve  estimation  along the data boundary.  The 
matrix 𝐐 𝜅,𝜏is a sparse precision  (inverse  covariance)  matrix with a ﬁxed 
set of non-zero  elements  whose value are determined  by 𝜅and 𝜏. The 
smoothness  of the latent ﬁeld is controlled  by the 𝜅parameter,  which 
controls  how much distance  dependence  there should be in the ﬁeld. A 
larger value for 𝜅corresponds  to a “smoother  ”latent  ﬁeld with a larger 
range of spatial dependence.  The precision  parameter  𝜏determines  the 
level of precision  in the latent ﬁeld such that lower values correspond  to 
lower precision  values (higher  variance)  in the prior. The matrix 𝐆 is a 
sparse, symmetric  adjacency  matrix in which non-zero  entries exist only 
on the diagonal  and in cells corresponding  to neighboring  locations,  and 
𝐂 is a diagonal  matrix ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2013 ). 
The single-run  SBSB GLM assumes  independent  SPDE priors on 
each of the 𝐾latent ﬁelds. Let 𝐲 = ( 𝐲 ′
1 , …, 𝐲 ′
𝑁 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁𝑇×1 , let 
𝐗 = block-diagonal  ( 𝐗 1 , …, 𝐗 𝑁 ) ∈ℝ 𝑁 𝑇×𝑁 𝐾 , and let 𝜷= ( 𝜷′
1 , …, 𝜷′
𝑁 ) ′∈
ℝ 𝑁×𝐾 . The surface-based  spatial Bayesian  GLM is given by 
𝐲|𝜷= 𝐗 𝜷+ 𝐞 , 𝐞 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑁𝑇 ) 
𝜷𝑘 = 𝚿𝐰 𝑘 , 𝐰 𝑘 |𝜅𝑘 , 𝜏𝑘 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅𝑘 ,𝜏𝑘 ) , 𝑘 = 1 , …, 𝐾 
𝜽= ( 𝜅1 , 𝜏1 , …, 𝜅𝐾 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝜎2 ) ∼𝜋( 𝜽) , (4) 
where 𝜽contains  all the model hyperparameters,  and 𝜋( 𝜽) is their joint 
prior. We adopt the default priors set by the R-INLA  framework:  In- 
dependent  log-Normal  distributions  are used for all 𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 , and a 
Gamma  distribution  is used for the precision  ( 1 
𝜎2 ). 
Multi-run  model.  If multiple  runs of task data are available  from 
a given subject,  it is beneﬁcial  to leverage  those repeated  measures  to 
more accurately  estimate  the model hyperparameters  (e.g. the parame-  
ters 𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 controlling  the spatial properties  of the activation  ampli- 
tude for each task 𝑘 , and the residual  variance  𝜎2 ). We therefore  propose  
a multi-run  spatial Bayesian  GLM to jointly model runs 𝑗 = 1 , …, 𝐽. Let 
𝐲 𝑗 , 𝐗 𝑗 , 𝜷𝑗 , 𝜷𝑗,𝑘 , and 𝐞 𝑗 be the run 𝑗-speciﬁc  quantities  in Eq. (4) . The 
multi-run  SBSB GLM can be represented  as 
𝐲 𝑗 |𝜷𝑗 = 𝐗 𝑗 𝜷𝑗 + 𝐞 𝑗 , 𝐞 𝑗 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝜎2 𝐈 𝑁𝑇 ) , 𝑗 = 1 , …, 𝐽 
𝜷𝑗,𝑘 = 𝚿𝐰 𝑗,𝑘 , 𝐰 𝑗,𝑘 |𝜅𝑘 , 𝜏𝑘 ∼Normal  ( 𝟎 , 𝐐 −1 
𝜅𝑘 ,𝜏𝑘 ) , 𝑘 = 1 , …, 𝐾 
𝜽= ( 𝜅1 , 𝜏1 , …, 𝜅𝐾 , 𝜏𝐾 , 𝜎2 ) ∼𝜋( 𝜽) , (5) 
where we again assume  for simplicity  nuisance  signals have been re- 
gressed  from both the response  and task predictors,  and assume  that the 
data have been prewhitened  to remove  temporal  autocorrelation  in the 
model residuals  and to eliminate  spatial heterogeneity  in the residual  
variance.  Note that the run-speciﬁc  activation  amplitudes,  𝜷𝑗,𝑘 , are es- 
timated  individually,  while sharing  a common  prior determined  by the 
parameters  𝜅𝑘 and 𝜏𝑘 . Additionally,  the between-run  average  amplitude  
can be estimated.  These provide  more statistically  eﬃcient  estimates  of 
activation  amplitudes  if diﬀerences  across runs are not of interest.  These averages  are constructed  as linear combinations  of the run-speciﬁc  la- 
tent ﬁelds, so their posterior  distribution  is available  and can be used to 
identify  areas of activation  as described  in Section  2.1.3 below. 
2.1.2. Group-level  modeling  
Previously  proposed  spatial Bayesian  GLMs for volumetric  fMRI data 
were limited to single-subject  analysis,  in large part due to the com- 
putational  burden associated  with analyzing  data from many subjects  
concurrently.  Mejia et al. (2020b)  proposed  a computationally  eﬃcient  
“joint ” group-level  modeling  approach  based on ﬁrst estimating  each 
subject-level  model separately,  and then combining  the results in a prin- 
cipled way. Here, we generalize  this approach  to any number  of runs, 
𝐽 ≥ 1 . For simplicity  of notation,  assume  that all subjects  have the same 
number  of runs 𝐽. Let 𝜷𝑚 ∈ℝ 𝐾𝐽𝑀 represent  the activation  amplitudes  
for subject 𝑚 for all tasks and all runs. The joint group-level  model- 
ing approach  is based on specifying  a group-level  contrast  matrix 𝐀 , 
so that the quantity  of interest  can be expressed  as a linear combina-  
tion of the subject-level  parameter  estimates.  𝐀 is based on a group 
contrast  vector 𝐚 ∈ℝ 𝑀𝐽𝐾 which speciﬁes  the desired  contrast  across 
subjects,  runs, and tasks. For example,  𝐚 can be constructed  to rep- 
resent the group average  activation  amplitude  in response  to a par- 
ticular task, the diﬀerence  in average  amplitude  across two groups of 
subjects  or diﬀerent  conditions,  or a contrast  across tasks. Next, the 
contrast  matrix is created  as 𝐀 = 𝐚 ′⊗𝐈 𝑁 , where ⊗represents  the Kro- 
necker product.  The group-level  eﬀect is deﬁned  as 𝜷𝐺 = 𝐀 𝜷∈ℝ 𝑁 , 
where 𝜷= ( 𝜷′
1 , …, 𝜷′
𝑀 ) ′∈ℝ 𝑁𝐾𝐽𝑀 is the concatenated  activation  am- 
plitudes  across all runs, subjects,  and tasks. A speciﬁc  example  is given 
in Section  2.2.3 below. See Mejia et al. (2020b)  for details on the poste- 
rior computation  of 𝜷𝐺 . Having  obtained  its posterior  distribution,  the 
estimate  of 𝜷𝐺 is given by its posterior  mean or other summary  metric, 
and we can identify  group-level  areas of activation  as described  in the 
following  section.  
Group modeling  under the classical  GLM was carried out by averag-  
ing the estimates  of the task coeﬃcients  from each subject,  i.e. 
𝜷𝐺,𝑘 = 1 
𝑀 𝑀 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝜷𝑖,𝑘 , 
where 𝜷𝑚,𝑘 is the length 𝑁vector of coeﬃcient  estimates  for subject 𝑚 
and task 𝑘 . Since all runs across subjects  and sessions  were of the same 
length with the same repetition  time, this is equivalent  to concatenating  
the data across all runs and performing  the group classical  GLM follow- 
ing the same steps as in the single-subject  classical  GLM. Activation  was 
determined  using t-tests, as in the single-subject  classical  GLM model. 
2.1.3. Identifying  areas of activation  
In the SBSB GLM, areas of activation  are identiﬁed  based on the 
joint posterior  distribution  of activation  across all locations  using an 
excursions  set approach  ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2015 ), implemented  in 
the excursions  R package  ( Bolin and Lindgren,  2018 ). In brief, the 
excursions  method  works by determining  the probability  that a set of 
vertices  all have activation  amplitude  greater than a set threshold  𝛾. 
This probability  is based on the joint posterior  distribution  across ver- 
tices, which takes into account  spatial dependencies.  The largest set 
with probability  at least 1 − 𝛼is said to be the “excursions  set ”. As the 
joint posterior  distribution  is used, this approach  avoids massive  mul- 
tiple comparisons  and the consequent  need for multiplicity  correction.  
As a result, power is increased  compared  with previously  proposed  spa- 
tial Bayesian  models,  which used the marginal  posterior  distribution  at 
each location  to identify  areas of activation  and hence required  multi- 
plicity correction  ( Marchini  and Presanis,  2004 ). While this approach  
does rely on setting a probability  level via 𝛼and a threshold  𝛾, so too 
do other methods  (note that 𝛾= 0 is typically  implicit  in the classical  
GLM), and researchers  need to take proper care choosing  and reporting  
these parameters.  
In the classical  GLM, by contrast,  areas of activation  in response  to 
each task or stimulus  are typically  identiﬁed  by performing  a 𝑡 -test at 
4  D. Spencer, Y.R. Yue, D. Bolin et al. NeuroImage  249 (2022) 118908 
every vertex, followed  by correction  for multiple  comparisons.  Tradi- 
tionally  the null hypothesis  for a one-sided  test is that 𝛽𝑣,𝑘 ≤ 0 , corre- 
sponding  to 𝛾= 0% . For a general  value of 𝛾, the null hypothesis  is sim- 
ply modiﬁed  as 𝛽𝑣,𝑘 ≤ 𝛾, with the alternative  hypothesis  that 𝛽𝑣,𝑘 > 𝛾. 
The test statistic  is then computed  as ( ̂𝛽− 𝛾)∕ 𝑆𝐸 ̂𝛽; based on this value, 
the 𝑝 -value is computed  as usual, namely  as the upper tail area of the 
𝑡 distribution  with 𝑇 − 𝐾 − 1 degrees  of freedom.  (Note that since the 
data has been prewhitened,  we assume  temporally-independent  residu- 
als.) Multiplicity  correction  in the classical  GLM typically  aims to con- 
trol the family-wise  error rate (FWER)  or the false discovery  rate (FDR) 
( Benjamini  and Hochberg,  1995 ). Many techniques  have been proposed  
to account  for spatial dependence  and encourage  spatial contiguity  at 
the correction  stage, including  permutation  tests, random  ﬁeld theory 
( Worsley  et al., 1992; 1996 ), and threshold-free  cluster enhancement  
( Smith and Nichols,  2009 ). However,  these techniques  are all limited by 
the shortcomings  of massive  univariate  modeling  at the model estima-  
tion stage, and as a result will have reduced  power to detect activations.  
The correction  itself has the eﬀect of further diminishing  power to de- 
tect activations.  Recently,  Bowring  et al. (2019) proposed  a conﬁdence  
set method  for group analyses  based on thresholded  eﬀect size maps, 
which was expanded  upon in Bowring  et al. (2021) using Cohen’s  𝑑. 
This method  is very promising  for large datasets,  but is only shown to 
be accurate  in sample sizes as low as 60. As our validation  is focused  on 
single-subject  and group analyses  for a sample size of up to 45 subjects,  
this method  is not used for comparison.  
Since in the SBSB GLM spatial dependence  is accounted  for and lever- 
aged at both estimation  and inference,  and because  multiplicity  correc- 
tion is not required,  its power to detect activations  tends to be quite 
high. This can result in large areas of activation  with small but non- 
zero eﬀect size being identiﬁed.  This is consistent  with previous  work 
that has found that when power is high, such as large group studies,  the 
traditional  choice of 𝛾= 0% can lead to identiﬁcation  of “signiﬁcant  ”ac- 
tivations  in areas with small eﬀect size that are not of scientiﬁc  interest  
( Bowring  et al., 2021 ). To avoid this, it is common  to specify a scien- 
tiﬁcally  relevant  activation  threshold,  𝛾, above which activations  are of 
interest.  For example,  if the data are scaled to represent  percent  signal 
change,  an activation  threshold  of 𝛾= 0 . 1% to 2% may be reasonable,  de- 
pending  on the magnitude  of signal change evoked  by a particular  task. 
This does not mean that using a threshold  of 𝛾= 0% is never appropri-  
ate. However,  it is important  that researchers  are aware of the increase  
in power using the SBSB GLM and the higher likelihood  of subtle ac- 
tivations  being labelled  as signiﬁcant.  Higher thresholds  will generally  
result in more localized  areas of activation.  
For a given value of 𝛾and signiﬁcance  level 𝛼, the areas of activa- 
tion identiﬁed  can be said to have activation  greater than or equal to 𝛾
with probability  at least 1 − 𝛼, based on the joint posterior  distribution  
across all vertices.  That is, there is probability  of 𝛼or less that at least 
one vertex in the activated  region is a false positive.  The excursions  set 
approach  therefore  controls  the FWER at level 𝛼, but with typically  much 
greater power to detect true activations  than in the classical  GLM. Both 
the excursions  set approach  in the Bayesian  GLM and Bonferroni  correc- 
tion in the classical  GLM, applied  within a single hemisphere,  control 
the probability  of a single false positive  at 𝛼. Therefore,  by controlling  
the FWER within each hemisphere,  we are eﬀectively  controlling  the 
probability  of a false positive  across both hemispheres  at 1 − (1 − 𝛼) 2 . 
If 𝛼= 0 . 01 as in our analysis,  this equals 0 . 0199 ≈0 . 02 . Therefore,  the 
whole-brain  FWER is controlled  at approximately  2 𝛼.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12944, 12949), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(19986, 19992), match='\n2.2. '>"

Twenty-six  participants  (age range = 19–28 years, M age = 22.33 
years, 50% female)  were recruited  via SONA, the online system used 
by the Donders  Institute  for Brain, Cognition  and Behaviour  to manage  
the research  participant  pool. All participants  were pre-screened  for any 
behavioral  and health related abnormalities  via an online questionnaire,  
and the study was approved  by the local ethical committee.  
We excluded  ﬁve participants  from our sample prior to neuroimag-  
ing analysis.  Two participants  were excluded  because  of technical  issues 
with the neuroimaging  session (e.g. head coil was not applied  accord-  
ingly), one because  they did not believe  that there was real human in- 
teraction  in the social condition  (which led to extreme  choices  such as 
investing  all tokens in the lottery condition  and hardly any tokens in 
the Trust Game),  and ﬁnally two participants  because  they selected  the 
exact same investment  for all experimental  trials. The analyses  reported  
here are therefore  based on twenty-one  participants  ( M age = 2",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12710, 12715), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1119, 1124), match='2.27 '>"

Providing  the known image 𝒙 𝑡 and following  the forward  model of

the corresponding  k-space  of coil channel  𝑐is given by 
𝒚 𝑡,𝑐 = 𝐺ℱ 𝑺 𝑐 𝒙 𝑡 + 𝒏 𝑡,𝑐 , (2) 
where the image 𝒙 𝑡 is sensed by coil channel  𝑐with the sensitivities  
contained  in a diagonal  matrix 𝑺 𝑐 ∈ℂ 𝑃×𝑃 , and Fourier  transformed  
in k-space  signals by ℱ , followed  by the subsampling  operation  𝐺 ∈
{0 , 1} 𝑄 ×𝑃 , 𝑄 ≪ 𝑃 , with exactly one nonzero  in each row and usually  
not more than one nonzero  in each column,  which is a common  prac- 
tice for accelerating  the imaging.  𝒏 𝑡,𝑐 ∈ℂ 𝑄 is the noise of the sampled  
positions  for echo 𝑡 in coil channel  𝑐. 
Substituting  Eq. (1) into Eq. (2) , we unify the relaxation  model and 
the forward  model of image reconstruction  as

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119595,"2.1. Generative  model 
Here we propose  a model for generating  neuroimaging  data that ex- 
plicitly models functional  brain networks,  including  a metric of their 
FC, as a dynamic  quantity.  The model describes  time series data using 
a set of modes , which are constituent  elements  that can be combined  to 
deﬁne time-varying  statistics  of the data. When trained  on neuroimag-  
ing data, modes are simply static spatial brain activity  patterns  that can 
overlap  with each other. We refer to them as “modes  ”to emphasise  that 
the model is not categorical,  i.e. that modes should not be mistaken  for 
mutually  exclusive  states (as would be the case in an HMM).  Similar  
to an HMM, our generative  model has two components:  a latent repre- 
sentation  and a data generating  process  given the latent representation,  
which is referred  to as an observation  model . In our case, the latent repre- 
sentation  is a set of mixing coeﬃcients  𝜶𝑡 and the observation  model is a 
multivariate  normal  distribution.  The mean and covariance  of the multi- 
variate normal  distribution  is determined  by linearly  mixing the modes’ 
spatial models,  i.e. means 𝝁𝑗 and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 , with the coeﬃcients  
𝜶𝑡 . The mixing coeﬃcients  are dynamic  in nature whereas  the modes 
are static. Therefore,  dynamics  in the observed  data are captured  in the 
dynamics  of the mixing coeﬃcients.  The mixing coeﬃcients  provide  a 
low-dimensional  and interpretable  dynamic  description  of the data and 
modes correspond  to static spatial distributions  of activity/FC,  where 
mode-speciﬁc  FC is captured  by the between-brain-region  correlations  
in 𝑫 𝑗 . Both of these quantities  are useful for understanding  the data. An 
overview  of the generative  model is shown in Fig. 1 and a mathematical  
formulation  is given below. 
At each time point 𝑡 there is a probabilistic  vector of free parameters,  
referred  to as a logit and denoted  by 𝜽𝑡 . The logits are distributed  in 
accordance  with a multivariate  normal  distribution,  
𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) =  ( 𝝁𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) , 𝝈2 
𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 )) , (1) 
where 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 denotes  a sequence  of historic  logits { 𝜽1 , …, 𝜽𝑡 −1 } , 𝝁𝜃𝑡 is a 
mean vector and 𝝈2 
𝜃𝑡 is a diagonal  covariance  matrix.  We use a unidi- 
rectional  RNN to predict future values of 𝝁𝜃𝑡 and 𝝈𝜃𝑡 based on previous  
logits 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 . The logit at each time point 𝜽𝑡 is sampled  from the distri- 
bution 𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) . The historic  values of the logits 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 are fed into 
the RNN: 
𝝁𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) = 𝑔 𝜇( LSTM ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 )) , 
𝝈𝜃𝑡 ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ) = 𝜉( 𝑔 𝜎( LSTM ( 𝜽1∶ 𝑡 −1 ))) , (2) 
where 𝑔 𝜇and 𝑔 𝜎are learnt aﬃne transformations,  𝜉is a softplus  function  
included  to ensure the standard  deviations  𝝈𝜃𝑡 are positive,  and LSTM is 
a type of RNN known as a Long Short Term Memory  network  (). We refer 
to this network  as the model RNN . The logits 𝜽𝑡 are used to determine  a 
set of mixing coeﬃcients,  
𝜶𝑡 = 𝜁( 𝜽𝑡 ) , (3) 
where 𝜁is a softmax  function  which assures  that the 𝜶𝑡 values are pos- 
itive and sum to one. 2 The mixing coeﬃcients  are then used together  
2 Including  the positivity  constraint  enables us to interpret  the 𝜶𝑡 values as 
mixing coeﬃcients  and the sum to one constraint  ensures the distribution  of 
mixing coeﬃcients  is suﬃciently  non-Gaussian  for the model to be identiﬁ-  
able ( Eriksson  and Koivunen,  2004 ).

ues of a latent logit time series (solid squares,  blue back-

output of the model RNN parameterises  a normal distribution,  
𝑝 ( 𝜽𝑡 |𝜽<𝑡 ) , which we sample to predict the next logit, 𝜽𝑡 , (un- 
ﬁlled squares).  These logits are transformed  via a softmax op- 
eration to give the mixing coeﬃcients,  𝜶𝑡 , (unﬁlled  circles). 
The softmax transformation  enforces  the mixing coeﬃcients

any constraint  on the modes means 𝝁𝑗 and covariances  𝑫 𝑗 , 
this means they can overlap in time and space and the overall

Five-month-olds  : A ﬁnal sample of eighteen  5-month-old  infants 
from Australian  English  monolingual  backgrounds  were included  (M 
age = 5.49 months,  SD = 0.30 months,  8 females).  This sample size 
was decided  upon by drawing  on previous  neurophysiological  stud- 
ies that investigated  infant neural processing  of AV asynchrony  (e.g., 
Hyde et al., 2011 ; Kushnerenko  et al., 2008 ; Reynolds  et al., 2013 ) and 
compared  children’s  and adults’ neural processing  of AV speech (e.g., 
Kaganovich  and Schumaker,  2014 ; Knowland  et al., 2014 ). An addi- 
tional 20 babies were tested but excluded  because  of fussiness  ( n = 6), 
excessively  noisy EEG recordings  ( n = 11), or insuﬃcient  gaze data 
( n = 3). The attrition  rate in this study is not uncommon  for infant 
EEG studies (e.g., deBoer et al., 2007 ; Hyde et al., 2011 ; Reynolds  et al., 
2013 ). All infants came from a monolingual  Australian  English-speaking  
background.  
Four-year-olds  : A ﬁnal sample of 19 Australian  English  monolingual  
4-year-olds  were included  (M age = 4.16 years, SD = 0.14 years, 12 
females).  An additional  14 children  were tested but excluded  because  
they were very ﬁdgety and did not complete  the experiment  ( n = 5), 
had excessively  noisy EEG recordings  ( n = 3), or had insuﬃcient  gaze 
data ( n = 7). 
Adults : A ﬁnal sample of 18 Australian  English  monolingual  adults 
aged between  18 and 56 years were included  (M age = 23.42 years, 
SD = 8.75 years, 15 females).  An additional  eight adults were tested but 
excluded  because  seven had insuﬃcient  gaze data, and one experienced  
technical  failure.  
All infants and children  were born full-term,  not at-risk for any cog- 
nitive or language  delay, with normal  hearing  and vision, and no his- 
tory of ear infections.  Prior to the study, their parents  provided  written  
informed  consent,  were briefed about the procedure  and told that the 
session would terminate  immediately  if they wished so, or if their child 
showed  any signs of distress  during the session.  All adult participants  
had self-reported  normal  hearing  and normal  or corrected-to-normal  vi- 
sion, were free of neurological  diseases,  and provided  written  informed

study was approved  by the Human  Research  Ethics Committee  at West- 
ern Sydney  University  (approval  number  H11517).  The approved  pro- 
tocol regarding  participant  recruitment,  data collection  and data man- 
agement  was adhered  to. 
For all groups of participants,  noisy EEG recordings  were deﬁned  
as datasets  that contain  more than 20 bad channels  as in previous  in- 
fant studies (e.g., Kalashnikova  et al., 2018 ). Additionally,  for analysis  
purposes,  participants  were required  to have at least 10 out of 30 com- 
mon trials across the three conditions  (auditory-only,  visual-only,  and 
auditory-visual)  with a minimum  of 15% attention  (as calculated  by

nal sample.  The exclusion  criterion  for attention  (at least 15% attention  
in a minimum  of 10 common  trials) was decided  upon because  previ- 
ous eye-tracking  studies with young infants have used similar exclusion  
criterion  (e.g., 15% in LoBue et al., 2016 ; 20% in Taylor & Herbert,  
2013). As infant EEG studies have a typical attrition  rate of 50–75%  
( deBoer et al., 2007 ), the lower bound of 15% attention  was chosen 
to reduce further data loss. The mean number  of trials (per condition)  
included  in the analyses  are 15.83 for infants,  21.26 for 4-year-olds,  
and 25.61 for adults. The mean levels of attention  across conditions  are 
56.24%  for infants,  62.66%  for 4-year-olds,  and 79.95%  for adults.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(21778, 21783), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(4078, 4084), match='\n2.2. '>"

The data included  here were collected  from individuals  who par- 
ticipated  in one or more previously  published  EEG studies in our 
lab ( James, Strunk,  Arndt, & Duarte,  2016 ; Mirjalili  et al., 2021 ; 
Powell,  Strunk,  James, Polyn, & Duarte,  2018 ; Strunk,  James, Arndt, 
& Duarte,  2017 ). The participants  consisted  of 65 right-handed  adults 
(26 women),  ages 18-74. All subjects  were native English  speakers  and 
had normal  or corrected  vision. Participants  were compensated  with 
course credit or $10/hour  and were recruited  from the Georgia  Insti- 
tute of Technology  and surrounding  community.  None of the partici-  
pants reported  any psychiatric  or neurological  disorders,  vascular  dis- 
ease, or using any medications  that aﬀect the central nervous  system.  
Participants  completed  a standardized  neurological  battery  of neuropsy-  
chological  tests which consists  of subtests  from the memory  assessment  
scale ( Williams,  1991 ), including  list learning,  verbal span forward  and 
backwards,  recognition,  visual recognition,  immediate  and delayed  re- 
call, recall, reproduction,  and delayed  recognition.  Participants  were ex- 
cluded if their scores were above or below two standard  deviations  of the 
group mean. Furthermore,  older adults were administered  the Montreal  
Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA)  ( Nasreddine  et al., 2005 ) to test further 
for mild cognitive  impairments.  Participants  scoring  less than 26 on the 
MoCA were excluded.  All participants  signed consent  forms approved  
by the Georgia  Institute  of Technology  Institutional  Review  Board. Five 
older participants  (61-76 years) were excluded  in this study: two for 
noisy EEG (i.e., DC drift, movement),  two for not understanding  the 
task procedures,  and one for computer  malfunction.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14708, 14713), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1871, 1877), match='\n2.2. '>"

2.7. Statistical  analysis  
2.7.1. Descriptive  analyses  
Descriptive  statistics  were computed  with IBM SPSS Statistics  soft- 
ware version  26.0. Gaussian  distribution  was conﬁrmed  by the Shapiro-  
Wilk’s test ( 𝛼< 0.05), histograms,  and QQ plots for both female and 
male participants.  Group diﬀerences  of normally  distributed  data were 
analyzed  by parametric  tests (unpaired  t -test, 2-tailed).  Non ‐Gaussian  
distributed  variables  were assessed  by Mann ‐Whitney  U test ( 𝛼< 0.05). 
Spearman’s  correlations  ( 𝛼< 0.05 uncorrected,  𝛼< 0.0005 Bonferroni  cor- 
rected) between  clinical  scores were tested in the entire sample,  as well 
as in female and male participants  separately.  
2.7.2. Statistics  for metabolites  
SPSS was used for statistical  testing of metabolite  ratios (i.e., Cho/Cr,  
Naa/Cho,  Naa/Cr).  Gray matter fractions  in the ROIs were calculated  
with gray matter/(gray  matter + WM) for each subject.  This ratio is cere- 
brospinal  ﬂuid-independent  and can account  for possible  diﬀerences  of 
metabolite  concentrations  in gray and white matter.  Fractions  in the 
ROI voxels were assessed  by t -test for diﬀerences  between  female and 
male participants.  Then, the relationships  between  metabolite  ratios in 
the ROIs were evaluated  in the entire sample (Spearman,  𝛼< 0.05 un- 
corrected,  𝛼< 0.001 Bonferroni  corrected).  Then, group diﬀerences  were 
calculated  using the Mann-Whitney  U test ( 𝛼< 0.05). 
Next, the relationships  between  all neurometabolite  ratios with clin- 
ical scores (i.e., B5T, RS, PSS-10,  RSES, H-Scale,  GSI) were studied  using 
Spearman’s  correlation  ( 𝛼< 0.05 uncorrected,  𝛼< 0.0008 Bonferroni  cor- 
rected) in the entire group, as well as in female and male participants  
separately.  
In addition,  stepwise  multiple  regression  analysis  was used to test 
for signiﬁcant  predictors  of the B5T model by itself and together  with 
the other behavioural  measures  on the metabolite  ratios in the entire 
sample,  as well as in female and male participants  separately.  Models  
that could predict the metabolite  ratios with R 2 ≥ 0.30 and which sur- 
vived multiple  testing (Bonferroni)  adjusted  to 𝛼< 0.01 and 𝛼< 0.005, 
accordingly,  were considered.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(22224, 22243), match=' Data availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(2488, 2494), match='  \n3. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119444,"2.1. Deep learning-based  medical  image registration  
Existing  DLRs use deep neural networks  to directly  learn a complex  
mapping  from a pair of ﬁxed/moving  images to a spatial transformation.  
Supervised  DLRs trained  a network  using pairs of ﬁxed/moving  images 
as input and ground  truth transformations  as labels ( Sokooti  et al., 2017 ; 
Cao, 2017 ; Miao et al., 2016 ; Wang and Zhang, 2020 ; Yang et al., 2017 ; 
Cao et al., 2018 ). Ground  truth transformations,  however,  are usually  
diﬃcult  to acquire,  and thus ﬂawed transformations  measured  by tradi- 
tional ORs were used as ground  truth labels in some studies ( Fan et al., 
2019 ; Cao, 2017 ; Wang and Zhang, 2020 ; Cao et al., 2018 ), which intro- 
duced inherited  registration  errors. Alternatively,  synthetic  image pairs 
with ground  truth transformations  can be used, but the synthetic  data 
have to be carefully  designed  so as to resemble  the real data ( Zhao et al., 
2019 ). 
Weakly-supervised  DLRs removed  the reliance  on ground  truth trans- 
formations  by incorporating  manually  depicted  anatomy  labels and 
have shown improved  performance  in registration  accuracy  ( Hu et al., 
2018 ; Lee et al., 2019 ; Hu et al., 2019 ; Hu, 2018 ). The manual  deriva- 
tion of anatomy  labels, however,  is time-consuming.  Besides,  weakly-  
supervised  DLRs train a network  based on the similarity  between  the 
anatomy  masks of ﬁxed and moving  images,  where the anatomy  mask 
2  M. Meng, L. Bi, M. Fulham et al. NeuroImage  259 (2022) 119444 
of the moving  image is warped  to be spatially  aligned  to the ﬁxed im- 
age’s mask. This means that the network  learns to align the labeled  
regions  rather than to register  all image pixels, and hence exposing  
the pixels in the periphery  of the labeled  regions  to registration  errors 
( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ). In addition,  similar to supervised  DLRs, the 
registration  accuracy  of weakly-supervised  DLRs is still bounded  by the 
quality of anatomy  labels. 
Unsupervised  DLRs have been proposed  to eliminate  the reliance  of 
DLRs on label information  ( de Vos et al., 2019 ; Balakrishnan  et al., 2018 ; 
Dalca et al., 2019 ; Mok and Chung, 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2019 ). Unsuper-  
vised DLRs train a network  to minimize  dissimilarity  metrics  such as 
intensity  Mean Squared  Error (MSE) between  the ﬁxed and moving  im- 
ages. Unsupervised  DLRs are considered  more promising,  compared  to 
supervised  counterparts,  because  synthetic  or inaccurate  label informa-  
tion are not incorporated  into the network’s  training.  Recently,  unsu- 
pervised  DLRs tend to decouple  the complex  registration  process  into 
multiple  steps, and this has been demonstrated  to improve  the registra-  
tion accuracy  ( Hu et al., 2019 ; Mok and Chung, 2020 ). For example,  
Hu et al. ( Hu et al., 2019 ) proposed  a Dual-stream  Pyramid  Registration  
Network  (Dual-PRNet)  that decouples  feature learning  from transforma-  
tion optimization.  Mok et al. ( Mok and Chung, 2020 ) proposed  a Lapla- 
cian Pyramid  Image Registration  Network  (LapIRN),  which decouples  
the registration  process  with 3-level pyramid  networks  and achieved  the 
top-performance  at the 2021 Learn2Reg  challenge  ( Hering et al., 2021 ). 
The limitations  associated  with the availability  of ground  truth la- 
bels have been largely mitigated  by unsupervised  DLRs, but DLRs re- 
tain another  key limitation  in their reliance  on using globally  optimized  
networks.  As mentioned  above, globally  optimized  networks  inherently  
have degraded  adaptability  to variations  in unseen testing samples.  In 
some studies ( Balakrishnan  et al., 2019 ; Lee et al., 2019 ), test-speciﬁc  
iterative  reﬁnement  was incorporated  into DLRs to overcome  this lim- 
itation,  where the trained  network  is ﬁne-tuned  individually  for each 
testing image pair. It is worth noting that iteratively-reﬁned  DLRs per- 
formed  better than non-iterative  (one-pass)  counterparts  but at a higher 
computational  complexity,  thus reducing  the advantage  of DLRs on com- 
putational  eﬃciency.  
In this study, in contrast  to using test-speciﬁc  iterative  reﬁnements,  
we propose  an AAN to enhance  the adaptability  of DLRs to appearance  
variations.  We focus on inserting  the AAN into non-iterative  unsuper-  
vised DLRs that remove  the reliance  on using test-speciﬁc  reﬁnements  
and data labels for training.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12683, 12688), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(4512, 4518), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119732,"Introduction  
Neuroscientists  have long sought to explain  behavioral  sex diﬀer- 
ences based on average  diﬀerences  between  men’s and women’s  brains. 
Thus far, no such neural substrates  have been reliably  identiﬁed  for spe- 
ciﬁc behavioral  or psychiatric  diﬀerences  between  men and women.  One 
problem  with this approach  is that binary sex does not accurately  par- 
tition masculine  and feminine  behaviors,  such that brain correlates  of 
such psychological  measures  are likely lost in other dimensions  of indi- 
vidual variation.  In other words, binary sex may not be a precise enough  
independent  variable  for partitioning  subjects  when it is often gendered  
behavior  that we seek to understand.  
The deﬁnitions  of “sex ”and “gender  ”are not universally  agreed upon 
( Jacobson,  2021 ). For this paper, we favor the distinction  oﬀered by the 
World Health Organization  (WHO):  
Sex: “Diﬀerent  biological  and physiological  characteristics  of fe- 
males, males and intersex  persons,  such as chromosomes,  hor- 
mones and reproductive  organs ”
Gender:  “Characteristics  of women,  men, girls and boys that are so- 
cially constructed.  This includes  norms, behaviors,  and roles as- 
sociated  with being a woman,  man, girl, or boy, as well as re- 
lationships  with each other. As a social construct,  gender varies 
from society to society and can change over time. ”
Thus far, most neuroimaging  studies interested  in male/female  
diﬀerences  have divided  subjects  into binary groups based on self- 
identiﬁed  sex. Although  sex is increasingly  recognized  as not fully bi- 
nary ( Ainsworth,  2015 ; Karkazis,  2019 ), this dichotomous  approach  has 
been deemed  adequate  for deducing  how fundamental  features  of brain 
organization  diﬀer between  most men and women.  With imaging  analy- 
sis growing  increasingly  automated,  it is common  to do sex comparisons

tify brain diﬀerences  between  categorical  groups of males and females.  
Nonetheless,  a recent synthesis  of brain imaging  and postmortem  
studies found surprisingly  small and poorly reproduced  sex diﬀerences  
in structural  volumes,  laterality,  connectivity,  and fMRI activation,  af- 
ter global brain or head size has been controlled  for ( Eliot et al., 
2021 ). Moreover,  attempts  to link brain sex diﬀerences  to speciﬁc  
male/female  behavioral  diﬀerences  have largely failed ( Hirnstein  et al., 
2019 ; Liu et al., 2020 ) or produced  overtly contradictory  results (e.g., 
Tunçet  al., 2016 ; Satterthwaite  et al., 2015 ). 
Here we explore  whether  greater insight may result from grouping  
participants  by “gender  ”i n addition  to “sex. ”T h a t is, behavioral  ex- 
pression  along multiple  masculine-feminine  dimensions  may be more 
closely tied to individual  brain circuitry  than sex assignment  per se. As 
a primary  aim of such investigation  is to uncover  neural correlates  of 
gender-typical  behavior  or neuropsychiatric  health, it may be more in- 
formative  to use a multidimensional  gender scale, in addition  to binary 
sex, as an independent  variable.  Not only can gender attributes  be de- 
ﬁned more granularly  than sex, they have the advantage  of being shaped 
by both innate and experiential  inﬂuences,  so are likelier to be reﬂected  
in mature brain features  molded  through  the same inﬂuences.  
The importance  of distinguishing  sex and gender has long been rec- 
ognized  in psychology,  where various  instruments  have been developed  
for operationalizing  non-binary  measures  of gender.  Such tools allow 
researchers  to stratify subjects  along one or more masculine-feminine  
spectra  based on validated  self-reporting  measures  of identity,  expres-  
sion, relationships,  interests,  roles, activities,  and personality.  
The substitution  of gender for sex is also ﬁnding  value in other areas 
of biomedicine,  where binary sex can bias or obscure  ﬁndings.  For ex- 
ample, many behaviors  associated  with cardiovascular  disease  diﬀer be- 
tween men and women,  such as smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  physical

The ﬁrst is that the ratio of the T1w and T2w images represent  a com- 
bination  of contrast  of interest  that is correlated  with myelin content  and 
a multiplicative  bias ﬁeld ( Eq. 1 ). In a given voxel, x represents  contrast  
for myelin and b represents  the image intensity  bias ﬁeld ( Glasser  and 
Van Essen 2011 ) 3 . 
𝑇 1 𝑤 
𝑇 2 𝑤 ≈𝑥 ⋅𝑏

𝑥 ⋅𝑏 ≈𝑥 2 (1) 
Ideally,  the multiplicative  bias ﬁeld inherent  in MRI images would 
cancel, leaving  a bias free ratio image with increased  contrast  of interest.  
This ratio approach  to bias correction  has an advantage  over algorithmic  
bias corrections  in that it makes no assumptions  about tissue intensity  
uniformity.  There is a large literature  exploring  non-uniformity  of the 
cortical  grey matter —reviewed  in Glasser  et al., 2014 —and the white 
matter also contains  genuine  non-uniformities  (as will be shown in the 
results below, e.g., Figure 20 ). Importantly,  these grey and white mat- 
ter tissue non-uniformities  vary independently,  meaning  that an algo- 
rithmic  correction  attempting  to achieve  white matter uniformity  will 
induce a bias in grey matter and vice versa, resulting  in a critical limita- 
tion of approaches  that rely on algorithmic  bias corrections  using single 
tissues in isolation  (e.g., Nerland  et al., 2021 ). Indeed,  this observation  
originally  led to development  of the T1w/T2w  approach  ( Glasser  and 
Van Essen 2011 ), because  it makes no such assumption  of tissue unifor- 
mity. Eq. 1 can be expanded  to approximate  the eﬀects of the receive  
(rb) and transmit  (tb) bias ﬁelds separately  ( Eq. 2 ) 4 .

𝑥 ⋅𝑟𝑏 ⋅𝑡𝑏 𝑇2 𝑤 (2) 
This simpliﬁes  to Eq. 3 , as the spatially  inhomogeneous  receive  bias 
ﬁeld cancels  out exactly in the absence  of motion and the myelin con- 
trast is enhanced  5 .

3 Using a single variable  to represent  contrast  for myelin in both the T1w and 
T2w images is an approximation,  as the contrast  properties  for the T1w and T2w 
images related to myelin are not identical  (e.g., T1 and T2 ∗ in the gradient  echo 
T1w MPRAGE  and T1 and T2 in the spin echo T2w SPACE),  and of course not 
all contrast  in either image via these MR mechanisms  is driven by myelin. 
4 The exact equation  that Eq. 2 is approximating  is substantially  more com- 
plex, as the spin echo-based  T2w SPACE acquisition  employs  a substantially  
diﬀerent  RF pulse train (e.g., 90-degree  excitation  and multiple  variable  ﬂip 
angle refocusing  pulses up to 180 degrees;  Mugler 2014 ) that propagates  dif- 
ferently through  the Bloch signal equations  than does the gradient  echo-based  
T1w MPRAGE  image pulse sequence  (e.g., ∼8-degree  excitation  pulses): 
( 𝑇1 𝑤 
𝑇2 𝑤 ) 𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔 = 𝐸 𝑇1 𝑤 ( 𝑇𝑅 𝑇1 𝑤 , 𝑇𝐼 𝑇1 𝑤 , 𝑇𝐸 𝑇1 𝑤 , 𝐹𝐴 𝑇1 𝑤 ∗ 𝑡𝑏 ( 𝑟 ) , 𝑇1( 𝑟 ) , 𝑇2 ∗ ( 𝑟 ) , ... ) 
𝐸 𝑇2 𝑤 ( 𝑇𝑅 𝑇2 𝑤 , 𝑇𝐸 𝑇2 𝑤 , 𝐹𝐴 𝑇2 𝑤 ( 𝑛 ) ∗ 𝑡𝑏 ( 𝑟 ) , 𝑇 1( 𝑟 ) ,𝑇 2( 𝑟 ) , ... ) (2 ′ ) 
The eﬀect of the transmit  bias (tb) ﬁeld is inherently  linked to the tissue contrast  
and dependent  on the MR signal (i.e., Bloch) equations  of the underlying  acqui- 
sition pulse sequences  ( Mugler and Brookeman  1990 ; Mugler 2014 ), where TR, 
TI, and TE, and ﬂip angle (FA) are speciﬁc to the respective  acquisition  protocol,  
n indicates  multiple  variable  ﬂip angle refocusing  pulses up to 180 degrees in 
spin echo-based  T2w SPACE acquisition,  and r represents  spatial dependence.  
The eﬀect of the tb ﬁeld on T1w/T2w  ratio image in its exact form is non-linear  
(at least quadratic)  and related to tissue contrast.  
5 As for Eq. 2 , the exact equation  that Eq. 3 is approximating  is substantially  
more complex:  Unfortunately,  tb T1w / tb T2w does not equal 1 in any location  where 
the scanner  does not achieve  the prescribed  ﬂip angle, as T1w 6 and T2w 
images experience  diﬀerent  transmit  ﬁeld eﬀects (see footnotes).  No- 
tably, the eﬀect of tb T1w / tb T2w on T1w/T2w  varies spatially  according  
to the transmit  ﬁeld and is approximately  multiplicative  ( Bonny et al., 
1998 ; Collewet  et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2005 ; 
Weiskopf  et al 2011 ; Delgado  et al., 2020 ) but does not substantially  
aﬀect image contrast  over the range of ﬂip angles at 3T ( Mugler 2014 ). 
Importantly,  these transmit  ﬁeld eﬀects are expected  to vary across 
participants  ( MacLennan  et al., 2021 ) based on interindividual  diﬀer- 
ences such as weight,  Body Mass Index (BMI), or head size due to diﬀer- 
ential transmit  coil loading  and dielectric  eﬀects. These variables  may 
themselves  correlate  with variables  of interest  such as sex or age, or 
even be intrinsically  of interest  themselves  (such as BMI). Thus, if we 
have a measure  of the transmit  ﬁeld (TF), we can use it empirically  to 
attenuate  these eﬀects in the T1w/T2w  data by determining  the slope 
and intercept  that relate the TF to the remaining  bias in the T1w/T2w  
ratio with a linear multiplicative  approximation,  as in Eq. 4 where tb T1w 
/ tb T2w = 1/(TF ∗ slope + intercept).

For simplicity,  if the TF is already  scaled such that a value of 1 means 
that the reference  ﬂip angle was reached  exactly 7 and we accept that 
the T1w/T2w  values should not be changed  where the achieved  ﬂip 
angle equals the nominal  or reference  value, the intercept  must equal 
one minus the slope. This simpliﬁcation  leaves slope as the only pa- 
rameter  to optimize,  resulting  in Eq. 5 , which empirically  is a good 
approximation  (T1w/T2w)  approx for the much more complicated  ideal 
(T1w/T2w)  ideal correction  for the assumptions  detailed  below and in the 
footnotes  above.

To optimize  for the slope value of the B1+transmit  ﬁeld correction,  we 
created two diﬀerent  cost functions:  
For creating  species-speciﬁc  reference  templates  using left-right  
asymmetry,  we use Eq. 6 . For correcting  individual  subjects  using a pre- 
viously  created  species-speciﬁc  reference  template,  we use Eq. 7 . For the 
individual  participant  correction,  comparison  to a reference  template  is

≈( 𝑇1 𝑤 
𝑇2 𝑤 ) 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑥 ∗ 𝑓( 𝑡𝑏 ( 𝑟 ) ) (3 ′ ) 
Here we develop an empirical  tb ﬁeld dependent  function  f(tb(r)), to re- 
move most of the transmit-related  intensity  bias to yield a bias-corrected  
T1w/T2w  image, (T1w/T2w)  approx , that approximates  the bias-free  T1w/T2w  
image (i.e., (T1w/T2w)  ideal below) to a reasonable  degree at a desired spatial 
scale at 3T with these sequences.  
6 The T1w scan has the added beneﬁt of using an adiabatic  inversion  pulse 
for its initial 180-degree  preparation  that is designed  to be resilient  to transmit  
ﬁeld inhomogeneities  ( Garwood  and U ğurbil 1992 ). 
7 In the case of the AFI approach  in HCP-YA  data, the reference  ﬂip angle was 
set to 50 degrees,  and to compute  TF we divide the ﬂip angle map by 50.

more robust because  it does not require  signiﬁcant  and consistent  left- 
right asymmetry  in the B1 + maps, which is variably  present  across in- 
dividuals.  Instead,  Eq. 7 relies primarily  on the highly consistent  strong 
central to peripheral  gradient  in the transmit  ﬁeld that will be illustrated  
in the results,  e.g., Figure 5 , to ﬁt the correction.  To use Eq. 7 , however,  
we ﬁrst must have generated  a corrected  group reference  template  for 
that species ( Eq. 6 is also used to ﬁnd the value equivalent  to the nom- 
inal or reference  ﬂip angle when using the pseudo-transmit  approach  
described  in section 2.8 ). We thus ﬁrst create the reference  template  us- 
ing the asymmetry  method  ( Eq. 6 ). For Eq. 6 only, we make the plausible  
assumption  that the correlated  hemispheric  asymmetries  present  in both 
the group T1w/T2w  ratio and the group B1 + transmit  ﬁeld are spurious,  
as there is no neurobiological  mechanism  to generate  such correlated  
asymmetries  (nor are they seen in alternative  non-invasive  myelin map- 
ping approaches  with B1 + correction,  including  quantitative  T1, T2 ∗ , 
and MT; Carey et al., 2018 ). This bootstrapping  approach  to generate  
a species-speciﬁc  reference  T1w/T2w  template  relies critically  on the 
asymmetry  of the B1 + transmit  ﬁeld typically  found in 3T MRI scanners  
at the group level 8 , and would not have been possible  with a symmet-  
ric B1 + transmit  ﬁeld. Thus, we used the cost function  in Eq. 6 to ﬁnd 
the optimum  slope to produce  a corrected  group T1w/T2w  myelin map, 
where L is the left hemisphere  and R is the right hemisphere.  
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 = ∑
𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠 ||||||𝐿 − 𝑅 
𝐿 + 𝑅 
2 ||||||(6) 
We chose to optimize  this cost function  using the golden search algo- 
rithm ( Kiefer 1953 ; aka golden section search 9 ). This optimization  pro- 
duces a group average  transmit  ﬁeld corrected  T1w/T2w  myelin map 
(that we will present  in the Results in Figure 6 ). Using this corrected  
T1w/T2w  group surface map as a reference  template  (T), one can cor- 
rect individual  participants  (I) using the more robust cost function  in 
Eq. 7 . 
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 = ∑
𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠 ||||𝐼 − 𝑇 
𝑇 ||||(7) 
Importantly,  when applying  Eq. 7 , we want to allow for the exis- 
tence of genuine  per-participant  diﬀerences  in the spatial mean of the 
T1w/T2w  ratio. To prevent  such per-participant  diﬀerences  from bi- 
asing the cost function  in Eq. 7 , we do the following:  (1) identify  the 
surface vertices  where the calculated  actual ﬂip angle in the individ-  
ual is close to the target ﬂip angle ( + /- 5%, where the B1 + correction  
will not cause appreciable  changes  to the values at those vertices);  (2) 
ﬁnd the median  T1w/T2w  ratio within those vertices  for both the group 
and individual  T1w/T2w  maps; and (3) divide the ratio of the medi- 
ans out of the individual  map before computing  the cost function.  This 
process  avoids over- or under-correcting  the spatial pattern  because  of 
per-participant  diﬀerences  in the spatial mean of the T1w/T2w  ratio 
(correction  of nuisance  eﬀects on the T1w/T2w  mean will be addressed  
in Methods  section 2.10 ). 
We demonstrate  below that this approach  indeed works if an AFI 
map is available,  as is the case for the HCP-YA  data (though  unfortu-  
nately due to acquisition  artifacts,  the map is imperfect  at the individual  
participant  level, as will be described  in Methods  section 2.7 and will 
be shown in Figure 4 ). However,  in some HCP-style  studies no AFI map 
8 The B1 + transmit  ﬁeld is asymmetric  in the 3T Siemens  Trio, HCP ‘Connec-  
tomS’ (that we will illustrate  in Figure 4 ), and Prisma scanners  with circularly  
polarized  body transmit  coils. Such an asymmetry  exists due to the fundamental  
dependence  of the B1 + ﬁeld pattern on the electrical  properties  (i.e., permit- 
tivity and conductivity)  and geometry  (e.g., size) of the sample ( Glover et al., 
1985 ; Sled and Pike 1998 ; Ibrahim  et al., 2001 ), and thus is also expected  to 
be present in other vendors’  scanners  as well that use circularly  polarized  body 
transmit  coils. 
9 We chose Golden Search because it is a computationally  eﬃcient  way to 
ﬁnd an optimum  of an arbitrary  function,  and we have used it for this purpose  
elsewhere  in the HCP Pipelines.  is available,  so an alternative  approach  is needed.  A candidate  alterna-  
tive emerged  in the course of developing  an improved  receive  ﬁeld bias 
correction  approach  for fMRI data termed the “SEBASED  ” correction  
( Glasser  et al., 2016a ), which enables  biological  interpretation  of fMRI 
parameter  maps (e.g., so that estimated  task fMRI betas or variances  
have a consistent  scale across space). In particular,  diﬀerential  trans- 
mit ﬁeld eﬀects were also present  in the gradient  echo EPI (echo-planar  
imaging)  fMRI images and the spin echo EPI ﬁeld map images [for the 
same reason that they are present  in the T1w and T2w images as de- 
scribed  above, i.e., the signal intensity  depends  on sin(FA ∗ TF) for gradi- 
ent echo images and sin 3 (FA ∗ TF) for spin echo images,  FA = Flip angle; 
TF = Transmit  Field; Bonny et al., 1998 ; Collewet  et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 
2004 ; Wang et al., 2005 ; Weiskopf  et al 2011 ; Delgado  et al., 2020 ]. 
For the purposes  of fMRI receive  bias correction,  such transmit  eﬀects 
were nuisances  that needed  to be appropriately  modeled  (together  with 
T2 ∗ induced  susceptibility  dropouts)  to generate  an accurate  receive  
ﬁeld estimate.  However,  this “pseudo  ” transmit  ﬁeld can also be used 
for T1w/T2w  myelin map correction  if it is collected  during the same 
session as the structural  data. Indeed,  at the group average  level, this 
pseudo-transmit  ﬁeld has a remarkably  similar spatial pattern  to the AFI- 
based transmit  ﬁeld (as will be shown when comparing  Figures  5 versus 
9 and 12 ). Thus, the pseudo-transmit  ﬁeld can be used in the same way 
as a real transmit  ﬁeld if a reference  value can be established,  analogous  
to the nominal  or reference  ﬂip angle in the AFI transmit  ﬁeld (as will be 
described  in the pseudo-transmit  speciﬁc  methods  section 2.8 below).  
The above theoretical  considerations  entail several assumptions:  
1) No signiﬁcant  change in head position  between  the T1w and T2w images . 
For the receive  ﬁeld to exactly cancel, it must be identical  in both 
images.  Because  the head coil is stationary  during a scan, head mo- 
tion changes  where the brain anatomy  is inside the receive  bias ﬁeld. 
The use of on-scanner  corrections  such as Siemens  PreScan  Normal-  
ize will mitigate  this issue, as a ﬁxed, sharply  varying  receive  ﬁeld 
from the head coil is removed  from the images by the scanner,  and 
thus prior to downstream  motion correction  (which will align the 
anatomy  but not the receive  ﬁelds, given the diﬀerential  relation-  
ship between  brain anatomy  and B1- receive  ﬁeld when head mo- 
tion occurs).  Thus, if on-scanner  B1- corrections  are not used, it is 
helpful to separately  acquire  data to measure  the B1- receive  ﬁeld 
and apply this correction  to the data in a way that accounts  for the 
head movement  within a static bias ﬁeld (as will be described  in 
methods  section 2.7 ). This assumption  also applies to the use of GRE 
and SE EPI images for pseudo-transmit  ﬁeld computation,  as will be 
described  in methods  section 2.8 . 
2) No signiﬁcant  change in head position  between  the B1 + transmit  ﬁeld 
map and T1w and T2w images . Changes  in head position  may intrin- 
sically change B1 + inhomogeneity  due to diﬀerential  coil loading  
and reduce the accuracy  of B1 + ﬁeld correction.  This assumption  is 
diﬃcult  to address,  but it is expected  to be a small eﬀect at 3T given 
most 3T scanners  use a large body transmitter  coil and thus that the 
B1 + ﬁeld will be substantially  smoother  than the B1- ﬁeld. This is 
also not an issue for non-human  primate  imaging  because  the head 
is almost always ﬁxed during imaging.  
3) The B1 + transmit  ﬁeld can be related to the B1 + bias in the T1w/T2w  im- 
ages with a linear multiplicative  approximation  ( Eq. 5 ) . This study pro- 
vides empirical  support  for these assumptions  for the ﬁeld strength  
and sequences  used here, but, as we note above in the footnotes  
and in the discussion,  an exact correction  would be much more 
complicated.  Our success  here is likely the collective  result of 
optimized  hardware  conditions,  chosen sequence  parameters,  and 
well-implemented  key features  of each pulse sequence  (e.g., the 
adiabatic  inversion-recovery  pulse in the MPRAGE  ( Garwood  and 
U ğurbil 1992 ) and a SPACE sequence  where the typical non-linear  
eﬀect of the B1 + ﬁeld on spin echo-based  T2w images is conditioned  
by an optimized  variable  ﬂip angle train that yields a small and ap- 
proximately  linear dependence  of signal intensity  and contrast  on

ﬂip angle variation  (i.e., ∼+ /-20% typically  observed  in the human 
brain at 3T ( Mugler 2014 )). Application  of this method  outside  of 
these parameters,  e.g., at higher ﬁelds such as 7T or using diﬀer- 
ent pulse sequences  would beneﬁt from further validation  to ensure 
that the kinds of B1 + eﬀects that we attenuate  here are still being 
removed.  
4) The pseudo-transmit  ﬁeld reference  value correctly  indicates  where the 
scanner  achieves  the intended  ﬂip angle. Individual  diﬀerences  in T2 
and T2 ∗ may inﬂuence  the pseudo-transmit  ﬁeld map beyond  the 
real transmit  ﬁeld. T2 ∗ from large scale magnetic  ﬁeld inhomogene-  
ity is dealt with using the thresholding  described  below, but it is 
clear that the estimated  reference  value is slightly  diﬀerent  in the 
HCD and HCA datasets  due to such eﬀects. Similarly,  the scanner  is 
assumed  not to diﬀerentially  scale the GRE and SE images automati-  
cally in diﬀerent  subjects  (and such behavior  has not been found on 
Siemens  scanners).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(15000, 15005), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(18895, 18901), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119536,"1. Introduction  
The ﬁeld of vision science,  like other domains  of cognitive  neuro- 
science,  has widely adopted  functional  MRI (fMRI) as one of its core 
tools. This has led some researchers  to ask how much, if anything,  fMRI 
has taught us about the human visual system.  A symposium  at the 2021 
annual meeting  of the Vision Sciences  Society  was dedicated  to this ques- 
tion ( Aguirre  et al., 2021 ). Here, we draw attention  to the fact that many 
vision scientists  have used fMRI to answer the opposite  question.  
What has our existing  knowledge  of the visual system taught us about 
functional  MRI? 
fMRI’s potential  as a tool for advancing  our understanding  of brain 
function  depends  on the properties  of the tool and the signal that it mea- 
sures. Here, we observe  that vision science  has been especially  fruitful 
in characterising  fMRI –both the instrument  itself and the neurovascu-  
lar signal underlying  its measurements.  This is because  vision science  
allows one to control an input stimulus  which predictably  controls  the 
neural signal in space and time. One can then link the expected  neural 
signal to the observed  fMRI signal, increasing  our understanding  of what 
fMRI is measuring.  Such studies do not necessarily  lead to a new under- 
standing  of how the visual system encodes  information,  nor should we 
expect them to. Rather,  the goal is an improved  understanding  of fMRI 
and the blood oxygen-level  dependent  (BOLD)  signal that is the basis 
of most fMRI measures.  This, in turn, is useful for making  new discov- 
eries in other aspects  of brain function  where less is known about the 
relationship  between  input (stimulus  or task) and neural responses.  In 
particular,  vision science  has been used to address  questions  such as: 
• What does fMRI measure?  
• What is the nature of the hemodynamic  response  function  (HRF)?  
• What is the resolution  of information  that fMRI can measure?  
∗ Corresponding  author at: Department  of Psychology,  New York University,  NY, USA. 
E-mail address: marc.himmelberg@nyu.edu  (M.M. Himmelberg)  . • Can information  within the fMRI signal be used in decoding  and 
encoding  models?  
• Do the eﬀects of large draining  veins on the fMRI signal obscure  our 
view of local neural activity?  
• Are fMRI-based  parcellations  of the cortex reliable  and are compu-  
tational  fMRI methods  reproducible?  
In the long run, scientists  and clinicians  are more interested  in under- 
standing  brain function  than the tools used to measure  it. However,  the 
former depends  on the latter. Here we present  a summary  of research  
in which the systematic  nature of vision science  has been used to an- 
swer the above questions,  and how these answers  have contributed  to 
scientiﬁc  disciplines  beyond  vision.",\n?Introduction\s*?\n? | \s*?\n?1\.\s*?\n? ,"<re.Match object; span=(1127, 1132), match=' \n1. '>","<re.Match object; span=(2864, 2869), match=' \n2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118824,"1. Introduction  
Bullmore  et al. (1999) introduced  the cluster mass test for fMRI 
data (functional  magnetic  resonance  imagery)  and Maris and Oost- 
enveld (2007) adapted  it for EEG (electroencephalography)  data. It 
has since been adopted  for pupillometry  analysis  ( Hochmann  and Pa- 
peo, 2014 ). In all these cases, the statistical  problem  is the same: we 
want to test the diﬀerence  between  two or several conditions  on sig- 
nals, usually  originated  from measures  on participants  of an experiment.  
It can be one-dimensional  signals in time for one EEG channel  or pupil- 
lometry,  or multidimensional  signals in space and time in fMRI or multi- 
channel  EEG. We are interested  in assessing  the diﬀerences  between  ex- 
perimental  conditions  without  any prior information  on the location  or 
on the timing of the potential  true eﬀects. In addition,  the number  of lo- 
cations where there might be a diﬀerence  is usually  large (e.g., 600 time 
points ×128 channels  in multi-channel  EEG), and each corresponds  to 
one hypothesis.  From the nature of the data, the true eﬀects are usually  
adjacent,  in space and/or in time. This setting is often called “massively  
univariate  tests ”( Luo and Nichols,  2003 ) as it involves  many tests us- 
ing the same design. Statistically,  it is part of the multiple  comparisons  
problem.  
1.1. Classiﬁcation  of tests and error rates 
In the multiple  comparisons  problem,  it is useful to classify  the re- 
sult of a procedure  on 𝑚 hypotheses  in a 2 ×2 table ( Table 1 ) similarly

ses called signiﬁcant  by the procedure,  comprising  𝑆correctly  rejected  
hypotheses  (also called true discoveries  or true positives)  and 𝑉 falsely 
rejected  hypotheses  (also called false positives,  false discoveries  or type I 
errors).  Among  the non-signiﬁcant  tests, 𝑈are correctly  non-rejected  (or 
true negatives)  hypotheses  and 𝑇 are false negatives  (or type II errors) 
hypotheses.  Based on Table 1 , the ﬁrst characterization  of a multiple  
comparisons  procedure  is its family-wise  error rate (FWER),  which is 
the probability  of making  at least one false positive,  i.e., Prob ( 𝑉 > 0 ) . 
A multiple  comparisons  procedure  is said to control weakly the 
FWER if it guarantees  that Prob ( 𝑉 > 0 |𝑚 = 𝑚 0 ) = 𝛼FWER , where the prob- 
ability is computed  under the “full null ”hypothesis,  e.g., under the situ- 
ation where all null hypotheses  are true ( Hochberg  and Tamhane,  1987 ). 
Otherwise,  if merely one of the 𝑚 hypotheses  is under the alternative,  
the procedure  does not guarantee  a control of the false positive  for the 
remaining  𝑚 − 1 hypotheses.  If a procedure  controls  only weakly the 
FWER, true discoveries  are often coupled  with false positives.  
By contrast,  a multiple  comparisons  procedure  is said to control 
strongly  the FWER if it guarantees  that Prob ( 𝑉 > 0 ) = 𝛼FWER for all 
possible  combinations  of true null and true alternative  hypotheses  
( Hochberg  and Tamhane,  1987 ). The strong control of the FWER implies  
a ﬁxed maximal  error rate for any conﬁgurations  in the underlying  pro- 
cess. It provides  therefore  an ideal control,  as we do not know the suit- 
able conﬁguration.  The well-known  Bonferroni  correction  ( Dunn, 1958 ) 
and its step-down  version,  the Holm correction  ( Holm, 1979 ), both con- 
trol strongly  the FWER. However,  to achieve  this goal with a universal

simple procedure,  they use such loose inequalities  that for massive  cor- 
related tests the actual FWER is much lower that the target value of 
𝛼FWER and the statistical  power is disastrous  ( Groppe  et al., 2011 ). 
The max- T and min- p procedures  from Westfall  and Young (1993) or 
the Troendle  method  proposed  by Troendle  (1995) control strongly  the 
FWER as well. They all use re-sampling  by permutation  to obtain the 
joint distribution  of all 𝑚 test statistics.  The max- T uses the test statistic  
itself while the min- p uses its associated  𝑝 -value, which avoids loss of 
power if the univariate  distributions  are diﬀerent.  Troendle  method  can 
be viewed  as its step-down  version,  which proceeds  by eliminating  each 
time-point  once treated,  from the most to the least signiﬁcant.  It has 
uniformly  a larger power than the min- 𝑝 method.  Since these methods  
include  the correlation  between  the tests (which is preserved  by permu-  
tation),  they can adapt the correction  to achieve  a FWER at the target 
value of 𝛼FWER . In massively  univariate  tests, these procedures  are there- 
fore far more powerful  than Bonferroni  and Holm. Quite importantly,  
they allow us to interpret  each time point signiﬁcance  and therefore  
provide  information  on the precise timing of the start of a signiﬁcant  
diﬀerence.  
Although  these procedures  factor in the correlation  between  tests, 
they do not take advantage  of the speciﬁc  topology  or adjacency  of 
massively  univariate  tests. In that setting,  the cluster mass test ( Bullmore  
et al., 1999; Maris and Oostenveld,  2007 ) aggregates  the univariate  tests 
on the basis of spatial or temporal  adjacency,  which proves to drastically  
increase  the statistical  power. It should be noted that this procedure  con- 
trols only weakly the FWER. It is implemented  in MNE ( Gramfort  et al., 
2014 ), EEGLAB  ( Delorme  and Makeig,  2004 ) or permuco  ( Frossard  and 
Renaud,  2021b ) and is also based on permutation  tests. 
The cluster mass test procedure  is fully described  in Section  3 . Its out- 
put declares  zero, one or several signiﬁcant  cluster(s).  A cluster is a set 
of adjacent  time points that are aggregated  to increase  the power of the 
test. However,  the interpretation  of a signiﬁcant  cluster is not straight-  
forward,  and we cannot interpret  each time point separately  (point-wise  
interpretation).  Formally,  the cluster mass test only allows us to declare  
that we take an 𝛼FWER risk when claiming  “there is at least one alter- 
native hypothesis  within the signiﬁcant  cluster ”. Subsequently,  if we 
would allow ourselves  to reject the null hypothesis  for all time points 
within a signiﬁcant  cluster,  we take a larger (and unknown)  risk of a 
false positive  than the preselected  FWER target 𝛼FWER . In other words, 
a signiﬁcant  cluster that contains  true positives  has also a large prob- 
ability to include  false positives  as well. This is the reason,  despite its 
many advantages,  the cluster mass test cannot be used to time or to pre- 
cisely localize  eﬀects ( Groppe  et al., 2011; Sassenhagen  and Draschkow,  
2019 ). In particular,  it would be incorrect  to interpret  or state that the 
ﬁrst time point of a signiﬁcant  cluster is the ﬁrst time the conditions  
diﬀer. 
The TFCE (threshold-free  cluster enhancement)  ( Smith and 
Nichols,  2009 ) is another  concurring  multiple  comparisons  proce- 
dure based on clusters  that also controls  weakly the FWER. It is a 
transformation  of the statistical  signals that uses the concept  of cluster 
extent and cluster height and has the advantage  of not relying on a 
preselected  threshold  parameter.  Although  the TFCE provides  a 𝑝 -value 
for each time point, it would be incorrect  to interpret  these 𝑝 -values 
independently,  and again, it would be incorrect  to interpret  or state that the ﬁrst time point with a signiﬁcant  𝑝 -value is the ﬁrst time the 
conditions  diﬀer. 
Another  approach  that is very promising  in fMRI concerns  meth- 
ods that control errors over any set of hypotheses,  especially  the 
All-Resolution  Inference  ( Rosenblatt  et al., 2018 ) and the Post- 
Hoc Conﬁdence  Bounds  on False Positives  Using Reference  Families  
( Blanchard  et al., 2020 ). These methods  allow inference  on any set of 
hypotheses  that can be joint (cluster)  or disjoint,  while controlling  for 
any post-hoc,  user-deﬁned  selection  of the set. All-Resolution  Inference  
even provides  a lower bound on the number  of signiﬁcant  tests within 
the set. As with the cluster mass test, however,  these methods  do not pro- 
vide individual  tests for each hypothesis  but inference  at the set/cluster  
level. For M/EEG,  they can therefore  not provide  information  on the 
precise timing of the start of a signiﬁcant  diﬀerence.  
In this article, we propose  a new method  of multiple  compar-  
isons that combines  both the idea of clusters  and the algorithm  of 
Troendle  (1995) in an eﬀort to borrow  the strength  of both approaches.  
The aim is to provide  a powerful  procedure  that allows us to interpret  the 
signiﬁcance  of each time point (point-wise  interpretation).  Using simu- 
lation, we show that our new procedure  corrects  the excess of false posi- 
tives that would occur in a point-wise  interpretation  of the cluster mass 
test while being more powerful  than the min- p or the approach  from 
Troendle  (1995) . This procedure,  which we called the “cluster  depth 
tests ”, allows researchers  to interpret  the results in a point-wise  fashion  
in a much more reliable  way. In particular,  it implies  that it can be used 
to precisely  time the appearance  of an eﬀect. 
In the next section,  we present  the statistical  models for the massively  
univariate  tests and the cluster mass test, before explaining  why the 
point-wise  interpretation  of signiﬁcant  clusters  creates an excess of false 
positives  when true eﬀects are present  in the signal. Then, we present  
our new algorithm  and show how it is related to both the cluster mass 
test and the algorithm  from Troendle  (1995) . We show the conditions  
for a strong control of the FWER and present  a generalization  to multi- 
channel  data. Finally,  we present  some simulations  and an application  
showing  the advantages  and limitations  of our new method.  The pro- 
posed method  is available  in the free R software  ( Team, 2020 ) using the 
permuco  package  ( Frossard  and Renaud,  2021b ) for single-channel  and 
a port in python MNE package  ( Gramfort  et al., 2014 ) is under way. 
The multi-channels  extension  is available  in the permuco4brain  R pack- 
age (see Section  5 ).",\n?Introduction\s*?\n? | \s*?\n?1\.\s*?\n? ,"<re.Match object; span=(1745, 1750), match=' \n1. '>","<re.Match object; span=(11316, 11321), match=' \n2. '>"

A pre-existing  dataset comprising  rsfMRI acquired  scans from 50 
lightly anesthetized  C57Bl6/J  and wild type mice was used in this study 
( Filipello  et al., 2018 ; Zerbi et al., 2015 ). All mice were adults (age: 
14 + /-4 weeks; bodyweight:  25.1 + /-3 g; 39/11 male/female).  The ex- 
periments  were performed  in accordance  with the Swiss federal guide- 
lines for the use of animals  in research,  and under licensing  from the 
Zürich Cantonal  veterinary  oﬃce. 
The mice were prepared  for rsfMRI using established  protocols  
( Chelini  et al., 2019 ; Grandjean  et al., 2014 ; Zerbi et al., 2015 ). Anaes- 
thesia was induced  with 4% isoﬂurane  and the animals  were endotra-  
cheally  intubated  and the tail vein cannulated.  The mice were positioned

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119093,"2.1. Experimental  recordings  
For the empirical  data analysis,  we analyzed  EEG data which was 
previously  collected  in the project “Leipzig  Cohort for Mind-Body-  
Emotion  Interactions  ”(LEMON).  We summarize  participant  details and 
EEG data acquisition  brieﬂy in the following.  A more extensive  descrip-  
tion of the dataset of all study components  can be found in the original  
publication  ( Babayan  et al., 2019 ). Additionally,  we analyzed  the resting 
data portion  of an open MEG data set ( Schoﬀelen  et al., 2019 ). 
2.1.1. Participants  
EEG data was collected  from 216 volunteers  who did not have a 
history of neurological  disease  or usage of drugs that target the central 
nervous  system.  The study protocol  was approved  by the ethics commit-  
tee at the medical  faculty at the University  of Leipzig  (reference  num- 
ber 154/13-ﬀ)  and conformed  to the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Written  
informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants  prior to the ex- 
periment.  Data from 13 participants  were excluded  because  the ﬁles 
lacked event information,  had a diﬀerent  sampling  rate, mismatched  
header ﬁles or insuﬃcient  data quality.  In addition,  the data from 18 
participants  was excluded  because  of a low signal-to-noise  ratio in the 
alpha-band  as indicated  by a 1/f-corrected  spectral  peak in the alpha- 
band below 5 dB (see Spectral  analysis  section for exact procedure).  
One participant  was excluded  because  of suspected  wrong ordering  of 
channel  names, resulting  in corrupted  spatial patterns.  This resulted  
in datasets  from 181 participants  (117 male, 64 female,  age range: 
20–77 years). 
MEG data was collected  from 204 volunteers  with no history of neu- 
rological  disease.  The study protocol  was approved  by the ethics com- 
mittee (CMO - the local ‘Committee  on Research  Involving  Human  Sub- 
jects’ in the Arnhem-Nijmegen  region)  and conformed  to the declaration  
of Helsinki.  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from all participants  
prior to the experiment.  For 6 participants,  resting state data was not 
available.  In addition,  the data from 57 participants  was excluded  be- 
cause of a low signal-to-noise  ratio in the alpha-band  as indicated  by a 
1/f-corrected  spectral  peak in the alpha-band  below 5 dB. This resulted  
in datasets  from 141 participants  (75 male, 66 female,  age range: 18–29 
years). 
2.1.2. Recording  setup 
Scalp EEG was recorded  from a 62-channel  active electrode  cap (Ac- 
tiCAP, Brain Products  GmbH, Germany).  In this conﬁguration,  61 elec- 
trodes were in the international  10–20 system arrangement,  and one 
additional  electrode  below the right eye was used to monitor  vertical  
eye movements.  The reference  electrode  was located  at FCz, and the 
ground  electrode  at the sternum.  The impedance  for all electrodes  was 
kept below 5 k Ω. Data was acquired  with a BrainAmp  MR plus am- 
pliﬁer (Brain Products  GmbH, Germany)  at an amplitude  resolution  of 
0.1 𝜇V with an online band-pass  ﬁlter between  0.015 Hz and 1 kHz 
and with a sample rate of 2500 Hz. Recordings  were made in a sound- 
attenuated  EEG booth. In the experimental  session,  a total of 16 blocks 
were recorded,  each lasting 60 s. Two conditions  were interleaved,  eyes 
closed and eyes open, starting  in the eyes closed condition.  During eyes 
open blocks, participants  were instructed  to ﬁxate on a digital ﬁxation  
cross. Changes  between  conditions  were announced  with the software  
Presentation  (v16.5,  Neurobehavioral  Systems  Inc., USA). 
MEG data was recorded  using a 275-channel  axial gradiometer  sys- 
tem (CTF). Additionally,  three bipolar  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  measured  
horizontal  and vertical  electro-oculogram  and the electrocardiogram.  
Three head localizer  coils were positioned  on the participant’s  head (na- 
sion, left and right ear canals),  head position  was continuously  moni- 
tored. Data was acquired  with a sampling  rate of 1200 Hz. For the rest- 
ing state measurements,  participants  were instructed  to think of nothing  
speciﬁc  while focusing  on the ﬁxation  cross at the center of the screen 
for 5 min.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119699,"2.1. Data 
The following  sub-section  aims to give a description  of the ABIDE 
data set, including  a study on the scope of site eﬀects in the data. 
2.1.1. ABIDE Data set 
The ABIDE consortium  ( http://www.preprocessed-connectomes-  
project.org/abide/  ) was founded  to facilitate  research  and collabora-  
tion on autism spectrum  disorders  by data aggregation  and sharing.  The 
consortium  provides  a publicly  available  structural  magnetic  resonance  
imaging  (MRI) data set and corresponding  phenotype  information  of 
1051 individuals,  which comprise  539 individuals  with autism spectrum  
disorder  (ASD) and 573 age-matched  typical controls.  
For the present  study, we reduced  the number  of individuals  in the 
data set to 569 healthy  controls  (470 male) and 482 individuals  with 
autism (430 male). This reduction  in participant  numbers  was a con- 
sequence  of the exclusion  of all participants  with more than 10% or 
data points (or three ROIS) missing,  which aﬀected  4 healthy  controls  
and 57 individuals  with autism.  The data were processed  using a stan- 
dardized  protocol  ( Craddock  et al., 2013 ) of the FreeSurfer  standard  
pipeline  (Desikan-Kiliany  Atlas) as part of the Preprocessed  Connectomes  
Project ( Craddock  et al., 2013 ) and have been made available  for down- 
load on the preprocessed  section of the ABIDE initiative.  For the current  
study, we focused  on cortical  thickness  measures  of the 34 bilateral  re- 
gions (averaged  between  left and right hemisphere)  of the Desikian  Kil- 
liany atlas parcellation  ( Desikan  et al., 2006 ) as a part of the FreeSurfer  
( Fischl et al., 2004 ) output and the average  cortical  thickness  across 
measure  all 34 regions.  We chose to include  only cortical  thickness  mea- 
sures since they show a strong (negative)  association  with age (unlike 
measures  of surface area, which remain more stable across the lifespan  
( Storsve  et al., 2014 )). 
2.1.2. Site eﬀects in the ABIDE data set 
The ABIDE data set has been obtained  by aggregating  data from 
20 independent  samples  collected  at 17 diﬀerent  scanning  locations  
( Di Martino  et al., 2014 ). Although  all data have been collected  with 3 
Tesla scanners  and preprocessed  in a harmonized  way ( Craddock  et al., 
2013 ), sequence  parameters  for anatomical  and functional  data, as well 
as type of scanner  vary across sites ( Di Martino  et al., 2014 ). In addi- 
tion, sites diﬀer in distribution  of age and sex and in sample size. An 
overview  of site-speciﬁc  data is provided  in Table 1 and in ( Di Martino

The ABIDE data set is aﬀected  by site speciﬁc  eﬀects that are un- 
likely to be explained  by biological  variation.  They manifest  as linear 
and non-linear  interactions  between  scanning  site, covariates  (for ex- 
ample age and sex), and cortical  measures.  Similar  to batch eﬀects in 
genomics  ( Leek et al., 2010 ), those eﬀects lead to a clustering  of the 
data caused by external  factors related to the scanning  and analysis  pro- 
cess. With the aim to estimate  to which extent the ABIDE data set is 
aﬀected  by site eﬀects, we calculated  an ANCOVA  with age as covari- 
ate in the healthy  control sample of the data set. It revealed  that aver- 
age cortical  thickness  diﬀered  between  site (main eﬀect site: F(19, 516) = 4.4, p < 0 . 1 ×10 −8 , sum contrast.  partial 𝜂2 for site between  0.51- 
0.58 for raw data, see supplementary  material  Table 1.). In addition  we 
tested for diﬀerences  in variance  between  sites. Bartlett’s  sphericity  test 
Bartlett  (1937) showed  a diﬀerence  in variance  between  sites even af- 
ter regressing  out variance  that could be explained  by age and sex (p < 
0.001).  The site eﬀects in the healthy  control sample of the ABIDE data 
set are visualized  in Fig. 1 .",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(21465, 21470), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3893, 3899), match='\n2.2. '>"

All participants  gave their written  informed  consent  to participate  
in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and the study was ap- 
proved by the Institutional  Review  Board at Washington  University  in 
St. Louis. The complete  data collection  protocol  is described  in detail 
elsewhere  ( Corbetta  et al., 2015 ). Part of the data were used in previous  
publications  ( Siegel et al., 2016 ; Salvalaggio  et al., 2020 ; Siegel et al., 
2018 ; Griﬃs et al., 2020 ; Griﬃs et al., 2019 ; Corbetta  et al., 2015 ; 
Ramsey  et al., 2017 ). Data from 127 ﬁrst-time  stroke patients  with 
clinical  evidence  of impairment  and data from 21 demographically  
matched  healthy  controls  were considered  for inclusion  in the analyses  
2  E. Pirondini,  N. Kinany, C.L. Sueur et al. NeuroImage  255 (2022) 119201 
( Table S1 ). Healthy  adults matched  the stroke population  by age, gen- 
der, handedness,  and level of education  (see ( Siegel et al., 2016 ) for de- 
tails in inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  for the two population  groups).  
From the initial sample of 148 subjects,  n = 24 patients  and n = 2 
healthy  subjects  were excluded  from the analysis  because  of excessive  
motion ( > 60% of volumes  with a framewise  displacement  of more 
than 0.5 mm ( Power et al., 2012 )) or because  of a low number  of sig- 
niﬁcant  innovation  frames ( < 131 signiﬁcant  innovation  frames over 
a total of 808 vol). Importantly,  patients  and controls  had compara-  
ble head movements  (mean frame displacement:  0.28 ± 0.009 mm for 
patients  and 0.32 ± 0.03 mm for healthy  subjects,  respectively,  non- 
signiﬁcant  Wilcoxon  Ranksum  Test; and percentage  of volumes  with 
framewise  displacement  of more than 0.5 mm ± STD: 16.11 ± 16.09%  
and 16.55 ± 15.04%,  for patients  and healthy  subjects,  respectively,  
non-signiﬁcant  Wilcoxon  Ranksum  Test). This conﬁrms  that the diﬀer- 
ences found in the iCAP characteristics  are not resulting  from diﬀerences  
in head movement  between  the two groups.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(13673, 13678), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2079, 2085), match='\n2.2. '>"

included  in the study. Ages were chosen as representative  correlates  for 
early adulthood  (approximately  20 years old) and older age (approx-  
imately  60 years) ( Fox, 2007 ). Healthy  aging is associated  with some 
motor ( Studenski  et al., 2011 ) and cognitive  declines  ( Salthouse,  1998 )

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119670,"2.1. Participants  
This study was part of a larger project in which the same participants  
performed  multiple  tasks, including  a sequential  decision  making  task 
and a virtual reality spatial memory  task inside the scanner  and other 
decision  tasks outside  of the scanner.  
Here, we only report results from the MRI analysis  of the VR 
task described  below. Speciﬁcally,  following  our previous  publication  
( Koch et al., 2020 ), our analyses  were speciﬁc  to neural representations  
of direction  signals during the spatial memory  task performed  while un- dergoing  fMRI. Other data from the same participants  was not within 
the purview  of this study and was therefore  not investigated.  Data of 
102 participants  which were recruited  for two MRI sessions  and ran- 
domly assigned  to one of the two drug intervention  groups (i.e., L-DOPA  
–Placebo  or Placebo  –L-DOPA)  was available  for investigating  our re- 
search question.  Eighty-eight  of these participants  (43 OA, 45 YA) suc- 
cessfully  completed  both sessions  without  technical  errors. Four addi- 
tional OA were excluded  from further analyses  because  they did not 
respond  in at least a third of the trials in at least one of the two ses- 
sions. Decoding  analyses  of the L-DOPA  eﬀects introduced  additional  
requirements  for the distribution  of walking  direction  (see Materials  and 
Methods)  that were not met for four participants  (2 OA, 2 YA). Thus, the 
ﬁnal eﬀective  sample for these analyses  also excluded  these participants  
and comprise  of a total of 37 OA (age 65–75, 6 female)  and 43 YA (age 
26–35, 16 female).  
Note that the relatively  low number  of female OA reﬂects  diﬃculties  
in recruitment  after the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9330, 9335), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1784, 1790), match='\n2.2. '>"

The dMRI data analysed  in this study are part of the Human  Con- 
nectome  Project (3T HCP) ( https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp  ). We ex- 
tracted the data from 183 participants  (100 females,  83 males; mean 
age: 30 ± 3.9) from the HCP (Q1:S3)  data corpus,  which has a reso- 
lution of 1.25 mm isotropic.  For the diﬀusion  weighting  each gradi- 
ent table includes  approximately  90 diﬀusion  weighting  directions  plus 
b = 0 acquisitions  interspersed  throughout  each run. Diﬀusion  weight-  
ing consisted  of three shells of b = 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm 2 in- 
terspersed  with an equivalent  number  of acquisitions  on each shell 
within each run (18 b = 0, 3 shells where each shell has 90 directions).  
See Glasser  et al. (2013) for more details on the protocol  and pre- 
processing.  Images were spatially  processed  using the warps generated  
by the HCP pipeline.  These warps transform  the data into MNI stan- 
dard space. Results are displayed  on an average  T1 image and aver- 
age surface created  in VBM8 from 550 healthy  participants  from the 
IXI-database  ( http://www.brain-development.org  ) and normalized  into

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119474,"2.1. Classical  skull-stripping  
Classical,  or traditional,  algorithms  that remove  non-brain  image sig- 
nal vary substantially  in their implementation  ( Cox, 1996; Eskildsen  
et al., 2012; Iglesias  et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2017; Ségonne  et al., 2004; 
Shattuck  et al., 2001; Smith, 2002 ). One common  class of approaches  
leverages  a deformable  mesh model to reconstruct  a smooth  boundary  
of the brain matter surface.  The widely-used  Brain Extraction  Tool (BET; 
Smith, 2002 ), distributed  as part of the FSL package  ( Jenkinson  et al., 
2012 ), utilizes  this technique  by initializing  a spherical  mesh at the 
barycenter  of the brain and projecting  mesh vertices  outwards  to model 
the brain border.  Since BET uses locally adaptive  intensity  thresholds  
to distinguish  brain and non-brain  voxels, it generalizes  to a variety of 
contrasts,  such as T1w, T2w, and PDw. To prevent  surface leaks beyond  
the brain boundary,  3dSkullStrip,  a component  of AFNI ( Cox, 1996 ), 
extends  the BET strategy  by considering  information  on the surface ex- 
terior, accounting  for eyes, ventricles,  and skull. 
The popular  hybrid approach  ( Ségonne  et al., 2004 ) available  in 
FreeSurfer  also leverages  a deformable  surface paradigm,  combing  it 
with a watershed  algorithm  and statistical  atlas to improve  robustness.  
First, the watershed  establishes  an estimate  of the white-matter  mask, 
which is then reﬁned to the brain boundary  using a surface mesh expan- 
sion. A probabilistic  atlas of intensity  distributions  helps prevent  out- 
liers during mesh ﬁtting, and erroneous  brain mask voxels are removed  
during post-processing  via a graph cuts algorithm  ( Greig et al., 1989; 
Sadananthan  et al., 2010 ) that thresholds  the cerebrospinal  ﬂuid (CSF). 
While eﬀective,  this technique  is optimized  only for images with T1w 
contrast,  since it relies on the underlying  assumption  that white matter 
is surrounded  by darker gray matter and CSF. Another  hybrid approach,  
ROBEX  ( Iglesias  et al., 2011 ), exploits  a joint generative-discriminative  
model. A Random  Forest classiﬁcation  ( Breiman,  2001 ) detects the brain 
contour,  which is used to ﬁt a point-distribution  model to the brain tar- 
get. The skull-stripping  tool BEaST ( Eskildsen  et al., 2012 ) builds on 
patch-based,  non-local  segmentation  techniques  ( Coupé et  al., 2010; 
2011; Roy et al., 2017 ) and assigns a label to each voxel by compar-  
ing its local neighborhood  to patches  in a reference  set with prior la- 
bels. With the exception  of BET and 3dSkullStrip,  all of these tools were 
speciﬁcally  developed  for T1w images.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10625, 10630), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2704, 2710), match='\n2.2. '>"

Aging-related  disorders  of the central nervous  system aﬀect hun-

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119029,"2.1. Summary  
First, we describe  and present  an atlas of bundles  generated  with our 
literature-based  dissection  protocol  (FWT) for 68 WM fasciculi  based on 
the HCP-template  data using a bundle-speciﬁc  seeding  and tractography  
approach  described  in more detail below. Tractogram  images were gen- 
erated using MRView  ( Tournier  et al., 2019 ) and Surf-Ice  ( Rorden  and 
Hanayik,  2022 ). 
Second,  we assessed  inter-session/intra-subject  variability  by apply- 
ing the FWT whole-brain  tractography  and bundle segmentation  ap- 
proach to the individual  HCP test-retest  datasets  ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ) 
and conducted  similarity  analyses  between  the resulting  tractograms  
compared  to the HCP-template  bundles.  Resulting  weighted-dice  sim- 
ilarity coeﬃcient  (wDSC)  scores are shown in radar plots and were used 
to calculate  single-rater  agreement  intra-class  correlation  (ICC) scores to 
highlight  tractogram  variability  with respect to the template  bundles.  
Additionally,  we calculated  descriptive  statistics  and generated  violin 
plots for the wDSC scores resulting  from pairwise  comparisons  of the 
output from each session (i.e., HCP scan 1 versus HCP scan 2). This pro- 
vided a measure  of FWT reproducibility  within and between  subjects  
regardless  of similarity  to a model bundle.  HCP inter-subject  variabil-  
ity was evaluated  by generating  voxel-wise  heat-maps  of the summed  
binary masks of each bundle.  
Third, to test the variability  of FWT in an independent  dataset with 
diﬀerent  acquisition  parameters  and sampling  schemes,  we applied  it to 
the MASSIVE  dataset ( Froeling  et al., 2017 ). Model-based  wDSC bun- 
dle similarity  scores, using the HCP-template  bundles  as references,  
were then calculated  for every bundle from both the HCP and MASSIVE  
datasets.  We computed  wDSC descriptive  statistics  and generated  violin 
plots for evaluation.  This provided  a framework  for the comparison  of 
the outputs  from both datasets.  Finally,  we used single-rater  agreement  
ICC scores to evaluate  overall inter-session  agreement.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11449, 11454), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2154, 2160), match='\n2.2. '>"

Over the past decade there has been a great research  interest  in 
artiﬁcial  intelligence  approaches  assisting  the management  of demen-

biomarkers  from large-scale  datasets  have shown huge potential  to de-

monitor  and predict the development  of symptoms.  Because  of this huge 
potential  and increased  availability  of data, many articles  presenting

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119415,"2.1. Data 
Three distinct  datasets  were used to: 1) train the brain age pre- 
diction model, 2) investigate  whether  individuals  with obesity  have 
greater brain age than individuals  with normal  weight,  and 3) inves- 
tigate whether  weight loss as a result of bariatric  surgery  reverses  the 
eﬀect of obesity  and lowers the brain age. 
1) Training  dataset 
Data used to train the brain age prediction  model included  par- 
ticipants  with T1-weighted  MRI data available  from the second 
stage of the Cambridge  Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience  (Cam- 
CAN, https://www.cam-can.org/index.php?content  = dataset ) dataset,  
described  in Shafto et al. (2014) ( Shafto et al., 2014 ) and Taylor et al. 
(2017) ( Taylor et al., 2017 ). Participants  were screened  for neurologi-  
cal and psychiatric  conditions  and those with such underlying  disorders  
were excluded  from the study. In total, we have included  data from 640 
participants  (324 female),  with age range between  18 and 88 (and mean 
+ /- std of 54.2 + /- 18.6 yrs) and average  BMI of 25.8 + /- 4.6 kg/m 2 . 
T1-weighted  MRIs were acquired  on a 3T Siemens  TIM Trio, with a 
32-channel  head-coil  using a 3D magnetization-prepared  rapid gradient  
echo (MPRAGE)  sequence  (TR = 2250 ms, TE = 2.99 ms, TI = 900 ms, FA = 9 deg, ﬁeld of view (FOV) = 256 ×240 ×192 mm, 1 mm 3 
isotropic,  GRAPPA  = 2, TA = 4 min 32 s). For detailed  acquisition  param- 
eters see: https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/pdfs/  
CAMCAN700_MR_params.pdf  . 
2) Independent  dataset to compare  brain age between  individuals  
with obesity  and individuals  with normal  weight 
Data used to assess the predicted  brain age diﬀerence  between  in- 
dividuals  with obesity  and those with normal  weight included  an inde- 
pendent  sample from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) ( Van Es- 
sen et al., 2013 ; Van Essen et al., 2012 ). All the participants  from the 
HCP with a BMI higher than 35 kg/m 2 were included  in this sample.  
These participants  (n = 46) were individually  matched  (1:1) for age, 
sex, and ethnicity  with a group of HCP individuals  who had a normal  
body weight (n = 46). Other exclusion  criteria  included  participants  with 
missing  information  on age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity.  T1-weighted  3D 
MPRAGE  sequence  with 0.7 mm ( Nadig et al., 2021 ) isotropic  resolution  
images were acquired  by the HCP investigators  using a 3T MRI scanner  
(Siemens  Skyra) equipped  with a 32-channel  head coil. The following  
parameters  were used: 256 sagittal  slices in a single slab, TR = 2400 ms, 
TE = 2.14 ms, FA = 8 deg, FOV = 224 mm, T1 = 1000 ms, Echo Spac- 
ing = 7.6 ms, voxel size = 0.7 ×0.7 ×0.7 mm ( Nadig et al., 2021 ) 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). 
3) Bariatric  surgery-induced  weight loss assessment  dataset  
Data used for the main analyses  included  participants  with severe 
obesity  (mean age at baseline  = 44.0 ± 9.2 yrs; mean BMI at base- 
line = 43.9 ± 4.2 kg/m 2 ) who underwent  bariatric  surgery  at the Institut 
universitaire  de cardiologie  et de pneumologie  de Québec-  Université Laval  
(IUCPQ-UL).  These data are part of a larger longitudinal  study, which 
aims at investigating  the determinants  of metabolic  recovery  following  
three commonly  performed  surgical  weight-loss  procedures.  All the pa- 
tients at the preoperative  clinic that ﬁt our inclusion  criteria  (women  
or men with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 who require  surgery  and who meet the 
NIH Guidelines  for bariatric  surgery  ( Hubbard  and Hall, 1991 ); age be- 
tween 18 and 60 years) and exclusion  criteria  (any uncontrolled  med- 
ical, surgical,  neurological  or psychiatric  condition;  liver cirrhosis  or 
albumin  deﬁciency;  any medication  that may aﬀect the central ner- 
vous system;  pregnancy;  substance  or alcohol  abuse; previous  gastric,  
oesophageal,  brain or bariatric  surgery;  gastro-intestinal  inﬂammatory  
diseases  or gastro-intestinal  ulcers; severe food allergy;  and contraindi-  
cations to MRI) were approached  to participate  in the study. In this 
study, we used T1-weighted  MRIs of the participants/visits  that were 
already  collected  (87 participants  were included  at baseline,  71 par- 
ticipants  at 4 months  post-surgery,  47 participants  at 12 months  post- 
surgery,  and 34 participants  at 24 months  post-surgery,  Table 1 ). Not 
all participants  completed  all follow-up  visits due to: 1) the COVID-  
19 related lockdowns  ( n = 12), 2) technical  issues with the MRI scan- 
ner ( n = 2), 3) surgical  complications  ( n = 3), 4) pregnancy  ( n = 1), 
or 5) other personal  reasons  ( n = 2). The Research  Ethics Commit-  
tee of the Centre de recherche  de l’IUCPQ-UL  approved  the study. All 
participants  provided  written  informed  consent  to participate  in the 
study. 
Most participants  ( n = 46) underwent  a laparoscopic  sleeve gastrec-  
tomy (SG), a restrictive  surgery  consisting  of 150 to 250 cm 3 vertical  
gastrectomy  on a 34 French bougie starting  4 to 5 cm proximal  to the py- 
lorus ( Caron et al., 2017 ). Laparoscopic  biliopancreatic  derivation  with 
duodenal  switch (BPD-DS)  was performed  in 12 participants,  which is 
a mixed-surgery  combining  restrictive  and malabsorptive  mechanisms  
by creating  a 150 to 250 cm 3 vertical  SG and duodeno-ileal  anastomo-  
sis 100 cm from ileocecal  valve ( Marceau  et al., 1993 ). Thirteen  par- 
ticipants  underwent  a laparoscopic  Roux-en-Y  gastric bypass (RYGB)  
surgery  in which proximal  gastric pouch of 30–50 cm 3 is created  and 
anastomosed  to the proximal  small bowel by bypassing  the ﬁrst 100 cm 
and bringing  a 100 cm alimentary  limb on the gastric pouch. 
The study design has been described  in detail in Michaud  et al. 
2020 24 . Brieﬂy,  approximately  2 months  prior to surgery,  as well as 
4, 12, and 24 months  post-surgery,  participants  underwent  a physi-

cal examination  (blood pressure  and anthropometric  measurements),  
fasting blood sample,  and an MRI session.  They were asked to fast 
for 12 h before the MRI session (scheduled  between  9:00 and 10:30 
am). One hour before scanning,  they consumed  a standardized  bever- 
age meal (237 ml, Boost original,  Nestle Health Science)  for a 5 min 
period to control hunger level during the MRI session.  Hip, waist, and 
neck circumferences  were measured  in centimetres  and were conducted  
using standardized  procedures.  Body weight and body composition  were 
obtained  using a calibrated  bioelectrical  impedance  scale (InBody520,  
Biospace,  Los Angeles,  CA, or Tanita DC-430  U, Arlington  Heights,  IL) 
to calculate  BMI (kg/m 2 ), percentage  of excess weight loss (%EWL),  
and percentage  of total weight loss (%TWL)  as previously  described  in 
Michaud  et al. 2020 24 . %TWL is calculated  as 100 x (initial weight-  
current  weight)/initial  weight.  %EWL is the percentage  of excess weight 
mobilized  in response  to surgery.  It is calculated  as 100 x (initial weight-  
current  weight)/(initial  weight-ideal  weight)  ( Biertho  et al., 2010 ). Ideal 
weight is calculated  by multiplying  the square of the patient’s  height in 
meters by 23 kg/m 2 . Plasma levels of cholesterol,  high-density  lipopro-  
teins, low-density  lipoproteins,  triglycerides,  glucose  and insulin were 
measured  at the IUCPQ-UL  biochemistry  laboratory.  The homoeostatic  
model assessment  insulin resistance  (HOMA-IR)  index was calculated  
with the following  formula:  (fasting  insulin (pmol/L)  x fasting glucose  
(mmol/L))  / (22.5 ×6). 
T1-weighted  three-dimensional  (3D) turbo ﬁeld echo images were 
acquired  using a 3T whole-body  MRI scanner  (Philips,  Ingenia,  Philips 
Medical  Systems)  equipped  with a 32-channel  head coil at the Cen- 
tre de recherche  de l’Institut  universitaire  de cardiologie  et pneumologie  de

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118929,"2.1. Simulated  data 
Signals were simulated  in the MATLAB  environment  (2020a,  version  
9.8.0) with use of the MATLAB  DSP System Toolbox.  The code and simu- 
lated signals are freely provided  at https://osf.io/f8jqd/  . Simulated  sig- 
nals comprised  a periodic  (sinewave)  and an aperiodic  (1/ f ) component,  
which were ﬁrst independently  generated  and then summed.  Details of 
each signal component  are described  below. 
The aperiodic  component  of the power spectrum  was simulated  us- 
ing the dsp.ColoredNoise  MATLAB  object, which generates  random  val- 
ues that follow a 1/ f x power spectrum,  with the exponent,  x , as a con- 
trollable  parameter.  Signals were simulated  with 8 diﬀerent  exponents  
ranging  linearly  from 0.1 to 2 (ﬂatter to steeply negative).  Note that 
the exponent  corresponds  to the slope of a straight  line ﬁt to the ape- 
riodic power spectrum  in log-log coordinates  multiplied  by − 1. The 
range of exponents  simulated  here was chosen to encompass  the dis- 
tribution  of actual exponents  measured  during resting-state  in a large 
sample of adults ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ), which has a mean of 0.83, 
but which can vary considerably  across the ﬁrst months  of develop-  
ment ( Schaworonkow  and Voytek,  2020 ). Lastly, the aperiodic  signal was mean-centered  and scaled by a factor of 9 to bring it within range 
of typical single-trial  EEG data (approx.  − 40 to 40 microvolts  when 
x = 0.91). Example  single-trial  signals are shown in Fig. 1 A. With these 
parameters,  the “rotation  point ”in the power spectrum  –that is, the fre- 
quency  about which the spectrum  pivots –is around 45 Hz (see Fig. 2 ). 
In intracranial  recordings,  the rotation  point was found to vary widely 
across brain areas, but has a modal value around 30 Hz in visual ar- 
eas, 40 Hz in auditory  areas, and 60 Hz in motor areas ( Podvalny  et al., 
2015 ). Thus, the aperiodic  activity  simulated  here has many features  in 
common  with empirical  electrophysiological  spectra.  
Sine waves (i.e., oscillations  or the periodic  component)  were gen- 
erated and summed  with the aperiodic  signal. Sine waves were deﬁned  
with a mean frequency  of 10 Hz and trial-to-trial  standard  deviation  
(SD) of 1 Hz in order to approximate  the typical bandwidth  of alpha 
activity  in real data ( Donoghue  et al., 2020 ; Haegens  et al., 2014 ). The 
choice to model the human alpha oscillation  is motivated  by the fact that 
frequency  sliding has been applied  particularly  often to the study of al- 
pha frequency  ( Cohen, 2014 ; Gulbinaite  et al., 2017 ; Nelli et al., 2017 ; 
Samaha  and Postle, 2015 ; Shen et al., 2019 ; Wutz et al., 2018 ). Oscil- 
lation amplitude  varied across 8 levels, linearly  spaced between  0.1 to 
15 (small to large). This range approximates  the range of peak-to-peak  
amplitudes  of single-trial  alpha oscillations  observed  in EEG, measured  
in microvolts.  The phase of the sinewave  varied randomly  from trial to 
trial between  -pi and pi, to mimic spontaneous  (i.e., non-phase-locked)  
activity.  
In total 10,000 trials were simulated  (corresponding  to simulated  
500 trials for each of 20 subjects)  at each of the 8 exponent  levels and 
8 amplitude  levels, for a total of 640,000  simulated  trials. Simulating  
fewer trials increases  the variability  of the estimated  frequencies,  but 
does not change the general  pattern  of results (not shown).  Each trial 
was 3 s long, with a sampling  rate of 256 Hz. To avoid ﬁlter-related  edge 
artifacts  in plots and averages,  only the central second of each trial (i.e., 
1–2 s) was extracted  following  the frequency  sliding analysis.  Power 
spectra  were constructed  by applying  a fast Fourier  transform  ( ﬀt.m ) to 
the detrended,  Hamming-tapered,  data from each 3 second epoch. The 
absolute  value of the resulting  Fourier  coeﬃcients  were squared  and 
log 10 transformed  (on single trials; see ( Smulders  et al., 2018 ) to obtain 
power in the frequency  domain.  We computed  the signal-to-noise  ratio 
(SNR) of alpha activity  on each simulated  trial by dividing  the power 
at 10 Hz by the average  power at neighboring  frequencies  6 and 14 Hz 
(note that this was done prior to log10 transformation  so that the re- 
sulting ratio was more interpretable).  These values were then averaged  
across trials in each simulation  condition.  Thus, an SNR of 1 means that 
there was just as much signal at 10 Hz as there was at nearby frequencies  
(i.e., there is no alpha peak in the single-trial  spectrum).  ”",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(8926, 8931), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(4624, 4630), match='\n2.2. '>"

Since 2010, ﬁfty-six  patients  with refractory  focal epilepsy  under- 
went a presurgical  intracerebral  electrode  investigation  with additional  
microelectrodes.  The aim of the clinical  intracerebral  investigation  was 
to determine  the SOZ when non-invasive  explorations  were inconclu-  
sive. Non-invasive  explorations  included  medical  history,  neurological  
examination,  brain imaging  (e.g. MRI, PET, SPECT)  and long-term  scalp 
video-EEG  monitoring.  The continuous  (24/7) video-EEG  monitoring  
with intracranial  electrodes  took place in the Epilepsy  Unit of the Pitié- 
Salpêtrière  Hospital  (Paris, France)  and started the day after the implan-  
tation. Recordings  lasted for 2 to 3 weeks, depending  on whether  enough  
informative  seizures  were recorded.  All patients  provided  informed  and 
written  consent  for the implantation  of microelectrodes,  which received  
approval  from local ethic committees  (CPP Paris VI, CNRS, 2004, 2006;

Three in-bred  strains of autism mouse models were used: the 
16p11.2  heterozygous  knockout  (B6129S-Del(7Slx1b-Sept1)4Aam/J;  
JAX #013,128)  ( Horev et al., 2011) ) (henceforth  referred  to as 
"" 16p ""), the Fmr1 hemizygous  knockout  (FVB.129P2Pde6b  + Tyrc-ch  
Fmr1tm1Cgr/J;  JAX #004,624)  (Bakker  et al., 1994 ) (henceforth  
referred  to as "" Fmr1 ""), and the Shank3  exon 4–9 (ANK domain)  
homozygous  knockout  (B6(Cg)-Shank3tm1.2Bux/J;  JAX #017,890)  
( Bozdagi  et al., 2010 ) (henceforth  referred  to as "" Shank3  ""). The mice 
were on the following  background  strains,  respectively:  B6129SF1/J  
(JAX #101,043)(henceforth  referred  to as ""129 ″ ), FVB.129P2Pde6b  + 
Tyrc-ch/AntJ  (JAX #004,828)(henceforth  referred  to as ""FVB""), 
C57BL/6  J (JAX #000,664)(henceforth  referred  to as ""C57""). 
These strains were chosen because  they were genetic  models with 
high face validity.  Speciﬁcally,  they are models with strong analogies  to 
the human condition.  For example,  the Fmr1 mouse line is a well studied  
model of the most common  single gene mutation  related to autism.  More 
pragmatic  considerations  like availability  were also considered,  along 
with the models’  distributions  in the clusters  from Ellegood  et al. (2015) . 
Active colonies  for each strain were maintained  at The center for 
Phenogenomics  (TCP). Breeders  were set up to yield control litter-mates  
for each strain. Speciﬁcally,  for the 16p strain, heterozygous  mice were 
bred with wildtype  129 mice to yield the desired  heterozygous  mutants  
and wildtype  control litter-mates.  For the Fmr1 strain, heterozygous  fe- 
males were bred with wildtype  males to yield hemizygous  males and 
wildtype  control litter-mates.  For the Shank3  mice, two heterozygous  
mice were bred to yield homozygous  Shank3  mutants  and wildtype  con- 
trol littermates.  
Mice were group housed,  and an attempt  was made to achieve  a 
sample size of 14 male mice per genotype,  per strain, per treatment

be suﬃcient  to detect group diﬀerences,  based oﬀthe variability  in the

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118786,"1. Introduction  
Sound experimental  design is key for empirical  science.  While rea- 
sonable  statistical  models may eﬀectively  extract the information  of in- 
terest from the data, one ﬁrst has to ensure that there is enough  in- 
formation  present  to begin with. Since there are signiﬁcant  constraints  
to acquiring  data, such as cost and ﬁnite acquisition  time, the experi- 
menter should aim to optimize  the experimental  design to maximize  rel- 
evant information  within those practical  limitations.  A poorly designed  
experiment  will bury signal within noise and result in unreliable  ﬁnd- 
ings. Of critical importance  for the detection  of an eﬀect of interest  in 
both neuroimaging  and behavioral  studies is to determine  an appropri-  
ate sampling  of a population  (i.e., subjects)  and a psychological  pro- 
cess/behavior  (i.e., stimuli/trials  of a task/condition).  Here we explore  
how sampling  these two dimensions  (i.e., subjects  and trials) impacts  pa- 
rameter  estimates  and their precision.  We then discuss how researchers  
can arrive at an eﬃcient  design given resource  constraints.  
1.1. Statistical  eﬃciency  
Statistical  eﬃciency  is a general  metric of quality or optimization

framework,  or an experimental  design based on this quantity.  A more ef- 
ﬁcient estimation  process,  model, or experimental  design requires  fewer 
samples  than a less eﬃcient  one to achieve  a common  performance  
benchmark.  
Mathematically,  statistical  eﬃciency  is deﬁned  as the ratio of a sam- 
ple’s inverse  Fisher information  to an estimator’s  variance;  it is dimen- 
sionless  and has values between  0 and 1. However,  since the model’s  
Fisher information  is often neither  known nor easily calculated,  here we 
will refer more informally  to a quantity  we call “statistical  eﬃciency  ”or 
“precision  ”of an eﬀect estimate  as just the inverse  of the standard  error. 
This quantity  is not dimensionless  and is not scaled to model informa-  
tion, but it conveys  the relevant  aspects  of both the mathematical  and 
non-technical  meanings  of “eﬃciency  ”f o r the estimation  of an eﬀect. 
Alternatively,  we also refer to the standard  error, which shares the same 
dimension  as the underlying  parameter,  as a metric for the uncertainty  
about the eﬀect estimation.  
Sample  size is directly  associated  with eﬃciency.  As per the central 
limit theorem,  a more eﬃcient  experimental  design requires  a reason-  
ably large sample size to achieve  a desired  precision  of eﬀect estima-  
tion and to reduce estimation  uncertainty.  For example,  with 𝑛 sam- 
ples 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , …, 𝑥 𝑛 from a hypothetical  population,  the sample mean ̂𝜇=

cal power, which, under the conventional  framework  of null hypothesis  
signiﬁcance  testing,  refers to the probability  that the null hypothesis  is 
correctly  rejected,  given that there is a “true ”eﬀect,  with a certain sam- 
ple size. Here, we focus on eﬃciency  or uncertainty  instead  of power to 
broaden  our discussion  to a wider spectrum  of modeling  frameworks.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119399,"2.1. Design of ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial window  
Principles  from the recently  emerging  ﬁeld of graph signal process-  
ing (GSP) ( Shuman  et al., 2013 ; Ortega et al., 2018 ) provide  an ele- 
gant framework  to design the ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial win- 
dow. Based on the GSP framework,  we analyze  fMRI time courses  at a 
discrete  set of positions,  which form a set of vertices  of a topological  
graph, in such a way that underlying  constraints  from ﬁber architec-  
tures can be accounted  for by edges of the graph. Here, we denote a 
graph as 𝐆 = { 𝐕 , 𝐄 , 𝐖 as usual, which consists  of a ﬁnite set of vertices  
𝐕 with |𝐕 |= N , a set of edges 𝐄 , and a weighted  connection  matrix 𝐖 . 
𝐖 𝑖,𝑗 represents  the connection  strength  of edge 𝑒 = ( i , j ) that connects  
vertices  i and j . On the vertices  of the graph, we deﬁne a vector f ∈ℝ N 
to represent  a set of auxiliary  quantities  to be used to generate  spatial 
windows,  where the i -th component  of the vector, 𝐟( 𝑖 ) , represents  the 
value at the i -th vertex in 𝐕 . 
For this study, voxel-wise  graphs are constructed  using ODFs derived  
from HARDI data with an isotropic  voxel size, which have been well de- 
scribed  in previous  reports ( Abramian  et al., 2021 ; Iturria-Medina  et al., 
2007 ). In each graph, every vertex corresponds  to a voxel in 3D MR im- 
ages with weighted  connections  to its neighbors.  The connection  weight 
of any two neighboring  voxels depends  on the coherence  of diﬀusion  ori- 
entations  between  the two voxels. As a result, two neighboring  voxels 
residing  in the same ﬁber tract have relative  larger weight than those in 
diﬀerent  ﬁber tracts. Note that a high angular  resolution,  a high voxel 
resolution  and an isotropic  voxel size of diﬀusion  MRI data are beneﬁ- 
cial to accurately  characterize  ﬁber-architecture-informed  connections  
in the graph.

Fig. 1. Schematic  of ﬁber architecture  informed  synchrony  mapping  in human white matter (WM). The algorithm  of the proposed  approach  consists of two major 
steps. First, a spatial window  is created for each voxel based on local ﬁber architectures.  In this step, orientation  distribution  functions  (ODFs) constructed  from 
diﬀusion  MRI data provide the information  on ﬁber architectures,  which are then used to generate  a topological  graph for WM. In this graph, every vertex corresponds  
to a voxel in MR images, with weighted  connections  to its neighbors.  The edge weights are determined  by the coherence  between  the directions  of diﬀusion  and 
the orientation  of the graph edges. Then, diﬀusion  on the graph with a point source located at each vertex is simulated  to produce  a diﬀusion  proﬁle that can be 
further used as a ﬁber-architecture-informed  window  (FAIWs).  Here, typical FAIWs created for four voxels ( P1, P2, P3 and P4 ) demonstrate  that they are adaptive  
to local ﬁber architectures.  Second, a modiﬁed  PCA is implemented  to estimate  the synchrony  of fMRI time courses based on the FAIWs from the ﬁrst step to yield 
activation  maps. In the modiﬁed  PCA, the FAIWs emphasize  the time courses associated  to voxels near the central position  with high weights,  which ensures the 
spatial speciﬁcity  of the synchrony  estimate.  
Building  on the topological  properties  of the ﬁber-architecture-  
informed  graph, a spatial window  is created  for each vertex/voxel  by 
simulating  diﬀusion  on the graph with point sources  located  at each ver- 
tex. A kernel is deﬁned  for the diﬀusion  process  in the spectral  domain,  
which is derived  from a Laplacian  matrix deﬁned  in GSP. Speciﬁcally,  
a Laplacian  matrix of 𝐆 is deﬁned  as 𝐋 = 𝐃 − 𝐖 , where 𝐃 denotes  the 
graph’s  degree matrix,  which is diagonal  with elements  𝑑 𝑖,𝑖 = ∑
𝑗 𝐰 𝑖,𝑗 ; the 
graph operator  𝐋 is a real symmetric  matrix,  and thus has a complete  
set of orthonormal  eigenvectors  { 𝑢 𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑁 and associated  eigenval-  
ues { 𝜆𝓁 } 𝓁=1 , 2 , …,𝑁 satisfying  𝐋 𝑢 𝓁 = 𝜆𝓁 𝑢 𝓁 . With these eigenvectors,  the 
graph signal 𝐟can be transformed  into the spectral  domain,  
̂𝐟 ( 𝓁 ) = 𝑁 ∑
𝑖 =1 𝑢 T 
𝓁 ( 𝑖 ) 𝐟 ( 𝑖 ) = 𝑢 T 
𝓁 𝐟, 𝓁 = 1 , 2 , …, 𝑁 (1) 
This spectral  representation  allows an exact reconstruction,  i.e., the 
signal 𝐟can be recovered  as 
𝐟 = 𝑁 ∑
𝓁=1 ̂𝐟 ( 𝓁 ) 𝑢 𝓁 ⋅ (2) 
In the graph spectral  domain,  the kernel of diﬀusion  ( Turner,  2002 ) 
can be deﬁned  as 
𝐾 ( 𝜆) = 𝑒 − 𝜏𝜆(3) 
where 𝜏is a free parameter  determining  the spatial extent of diﬀusion  
on a graph, and it can be intuitively  treated as the duration  of diﬀusion.  
Given an initial point source 𝐟 0 ( t = 0), the transient  diﬀusion  proﬁle at 
time point t can be derived  as 
𝐟 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑𝑁 
𝓁=1 𝐾 (𝜆𝓁 )̂𝐟 0 ( 𝓁 ) 𝑢 𝓁 = ∑𝑁 
𝓁=1 𝑒 − 𝜆𝓁 𝑡 𝑢 T 
𝓁 𝐟 0 𝑢 𝓁 (4) 
To create a spatial window  centered  at a voxel i we deﬁne this point 
source by setting the initial proﬁle 𝐟 0 to be equal to 1 at the position  i 
and 0 otherwise.  The transient  proﬁle 𝐟( 𝑡 ) at the time point t is further 
processed  to yield the ﬁber-architecture-informed  spatial window,  the 
width of which can be adjusted  by the parameter  𝜏. To be speciﬁc,  the window  is deﬁned  by taking voxels with 𝑀largest values of 𝐟( 𝑡 ) , which 
is subsequently  normalized  with their summation,  
𝐅 𝑖 ( 𝑗 ) = 𝐟 ( 𝑗, 𝜏) ∕ 𝑀 ∑
𝑗=1 𝐟 ( 𝑗, 𝜏) (5) 
In this study, the largest parameter  𝑀is taken under an empirical  
constraint  ∑𝑀 
𝑗=1 𝐟( 𝑗, τ) > 0 . 95 , wherein  small values in the diﬀusion  pro- 
ﬁle of each voxel are removed  to improve  computational  eﬃciency.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12874, 12879), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5665, 5671), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119053,"2.1. Phase-phase  synchronization  
Phase-Phase  Synchronization  (PPS) can be deﬁned  for within-  
frequency  as well as for cross-frequency  (CF) interactions.  In order to 
deﬁne the within-  and cross-frequency  synchronization  indices,  assume  
two complex  narrow-band  signals 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) ∈
ℂ with central frequencies  𝑓 𝑥 and 𝑓 𝑦 , respectively.  Here, by narrow-band  
complex  signal we mean the analytic  signal built using the Hilbert trans- 
form. Formally,  if 𝑥 𝐻 ( 𝑡 ) is the Hilbert transform  of a narrow-band  real 
signal 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) cos ( 𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )) , then 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑗𝑥 𝐻 ( 𝑡 ) is the analytic  
signal of 𝑥 𝑅 ( 𝑡 ) . In these formulations  the index 𝑅 indicates  that the sig- 
nal is real valued and the index 𝐻denotes  a Hilbert transformed  signal. 
Note that, another  way to get the narrow-band  complex  signals from a 
broad-band  signal is complex  wavelet  transforms.  
If 𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑦 then 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) are two narrow-band  signals in the same 
frequency  band. Their complex-valued  coherence  𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) ∈ℂ can be 
computed  from the following  equation:  
𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = < 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗 𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > 
√ 
< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 2 >< 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 2 > (1) 
where < . > is the averaging  operator  over time and 𝑗 = √
−1 is the imag- 
inary number.  
We use the absolute  of the imaginary  part of coherence  (iCoh) 
( Nolte et al., 2004 ) for estimating  the connectivity  between  two signals 
in the same frequency  band. This prevents  a lot of the within-frequency  
spurious  interactions  due to signal mixing and volume  conduction  in 
EEG. 
If 𝑛𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑚𝑓 𝑦 for 𝑚, 𝑛 ∈ℕ , the cross-frequency  synchronization  (CFS, 
known as m:n synchronization)  of 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) can be quantiﬁed  by m:n absolute  coherence  𝑐𝑜ℎ 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) ∈ℝ deﬁned  by the following  equation:  
𝑐𝑜ℎ 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = |< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗 𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝑚𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > |
√ 
< 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 2 >< 𝑎 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) 2 > (2) 
which is in principle  similar to m:n phase locking  value as: 
𝑝𝑙𝑣 𝑚 ∶ 𝑛 = |< 𝑒 𝑗 𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 )− 𝑗 𝑚𝜙𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) > | (3) 
with the diﬀerence  that in Eq. (2) the amplitudes  of the signals are taken 
into account  and the phase estimations  during higher amplitudes  are 
weighted  higher. Giehl et al. (2021) have used a variant of Eq. (2) . 
Equation  (2) reduces  to the absolute  part of Eq. (1) for 𝑚 = 𝑛 = 1 . In 
this work, we are speciﬁcally  interested  in the case that 𝑚 = 1 and 
𝑛 > 1 , i.e. when 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is a signal with central frequency  𝑓 𝑥 and 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) is 
a faster oscillation  with the central frequency  𝑓 𝑦 = 𝑛𝑓 𝑥 . In this case, 
𝑐𝑜ℎ 1∶ 𝑛 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) = |𝑐𝑜ℎ ( 𝑥 𝑛 , 𝑦 ) |, where 𝑥 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑒 𝑗𝑛𝜙𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) is built by multiply-  
ing the phase of 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) by 𝑛 , i.e. accelerating  𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) by a factor of 𝑛 . 
CFS as deﬁned  by Eq. (2) has a real value between  0 and 1, with 
0 corresponding  to the lack of any phase synchronization  between  two 
completely  independent  signals and 1 for two perfectly  synchronized  
time-series  with the same amplitude  envelope.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14180, 14185), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(3112, 3118), match='\n2.2. '>"

2.1.3. Human diﬀusion-MRI  data 
Human  participants  were drawn from the April 2018 release of the 
Young Adults Human  Connectome  Project study (n = 1206) ( Van Essen 
et al., 2012 ). Participants  were between  the ages of 25–37 and pri- 
marily made up of family groups,  with an average  size of 3–4 mem- 
bers and most containing  a MZ (273) or DZ (166) twin pair. Partici-  
pants were excluded  during initial recruitment  for psychiatric,  neuro- 
logical,  or other long-term  illnesses,  although  participants  who were 
overweight,  smoked,  or had a history of recreational  drug use and/or 
heavy drinking  were included  ( Van Essen et al., 2012 ). For the imag- 
ing analysis,  our samples  included  participants  who had a dMRI and 
T1-w structural  MRI scan (n = 1065). Of these, there were 575 females  
and 490 males. For detailed  recruitment  information  and for a full list of

Speckle  noise in OCT intensity  images ( Goodman,  1976 ) is a form of 
multiplicative  noise that is well described  at an arbitrary  voxel as 
𝑦 2 = 𝑥 2 ⋅𝑠, (1) 
where 𝑦 is the measured  OCT amplitude  and its square is the mea- 
sured OCT intensity,  𝑥 is the true OCT amplitude  and 𝑠 is the speckle  
noise corrupting  the OCT intensity  (i.e. the squared  amplitude).  The 
probability  density  function  (PDF) describing  the spatial distribution  of 
speckle  noise in OCT intensity  data is modeled  with a gamma  distribu-  
tion ( 𝑝 𝑠 ( 𝑠 ; 𝛼, 𝛽)) ( Feng et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2015; Goodman,  1975;

where the cortical  ribbons  were retained  for further processing.  
Further,  subjects  part of the HCP unrelated  dataset that did not over-

Learning  about contingencies  and causes of sensory  events is 
an adaptive  strategy  for dealing  with potentially  dangerous  stimuli 
( Seymour,  2019 ). This ability to predict physical  pain is essential  for 
generating  appropriate  responses  ( de Lange et al., 2018 ). The top-down  
inﬂuences  that generate  expectations  play a role in adjusting  sensory  
experiences  in ways that alter perception  to become  aligned  with the 
expectation  ( Fields, 2018 ). Top-down  modulation  of sensory  inputs 
has been most clearly observed  with pain stimuli so that even when 
the intensity  of a noxious  input is held constant,  participants  report 
more pain when they expect a stronger  noxious  stimulus  ( Fields, 2018 ; 
Lim et al., 2020 ). According  to the Bayesian  perspective,  perception  
results from the integration  of prior knowledge  with sensory  informa-  
tion ( Seymour,  2019 ; de Lange et al., 2018 ). Thus, perceptions  are in- 
formed  by both the priors, such as expectation  cues, and the sensory

2013 ; Wiech et al., 2014 ). We have shown that visual cues signaling  
increases  in incoming  heat stimulus  intensity  can lead to signiﬁcant  in- 
creases in perceived  pain intensity.  Even when the stimulus  was held at 
the same intensity,  pain ratings were aligned  more linearly  with the in- 
creases in cued-threats,  thus indicating  a biasing  eﬀect of the top-down  
cues. Such eﬀects of linear increases  in threat is prominent  in individuals  
( Lim et al., 2020 ; Hashmi  et al., 2014 ; Hashmi  et al., 2012 ) with higher 
pain catastrophizing  and lower mindfulness  scores ( Lim et al., 2020 ; 
Galambos  et al., 2019 ). Other participants  rate pain less linearly  with 
increases  in cued threat, reporting  less ampliﬁcation  of pain response  
with increases  in cued-threat  values. 
Neurobiological  diﬀerences  can have ramiﬁcations  for how sensory  
inputs are transmitted  and shared in sensory  pathways  in the brain 
( Spisak et al., 2020 ; Heathcote  et al., 2020 ). For instance,  weaker  struc- 
tural integrity  in pathways  that relay and integrate  information  may 
lead to a bias towards  top-down  threats.  Variations  in how brains are

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119561,"2.1. Data generation  
We simulated  behavioral  responses  in a detection  task ( Fig. 1 ). We 
assumed  that participants’  detection  threshold  is inﬂuenced  by an in- 
ternal rhythm,  and that this rhythm  is aligned  across trials to an event 
happening  at time zero. The rhythm’s  modulation  frequency,  its modu- 
lation phase relative  to the alignment  event, and its modulation-depth  
vary somewhat  across trials and participants,  yet they are suﬃciently  
consistent  to result in a rhythmic  modulation  of the mean detection  per- 
formance  ( Fig. 1 A–C). Additionally,  we simulated  a factor which inﬂu- 
ences the strength  of the rhythm  across time. In an actual experiment,  
such a factor needs to be observable,  e.g., pupil size, heart rate variabil-  
ity, skin conductance,  recent performance  history,  recent mean reaction  
time, time since beginning  the experiment.  
Speciﬁcally,  we assumed  the following.  (1) Within a participant,  and 
across trials : the rhythm’s  frequency  followed  a normal  distribution  
around the participant-speciﬁc  mean; its phase followed  a von-Mises  
distribution  around the participant-speciﬁc  mean phase; its modulation-  
depth varied with the arousal  state. We modelled  the state of arousal  to 
decrease  linearly  with trial number:  The ﬁrst trial had maximal  arousal  
equal to one, resulting  in the predeﬁned  maximal  value of modulation-  
depth, and the last trial had an arousal  equal to zero, resulting  in zero 
modulation-depth.  Note that simulated  arousal  could have been as- 
signed to diﬀerent  trials in any arbitrary  way, and this would not have aﬀected  the analysis  as long as arousal  was deﬁned  (or in an experiment  
measurable)  per trial. (2) Across participants  : the rhythm’s  participant-  
speciﬁc  mean frequency  followed  a normal  distribution  (with means dis- 
tributed  as shown in Fig. 1 D, unless otherwise  speciﬁed  for speciﬁc  anal- 
yses); its participant-speciﬁc  mean phase followed  a von-Mises  distribu-  
tion (with means distributed  as shown in Fig. 1 G, unless otherwise  spec- 
iﬁed for speciﬁc  analyses);  its participant-speciﬁc  maximal  modulation-  
depth followed  a normal  distribution  (with means distributed  as shown 
in Fig. 1 J, unless otherwise  speciﬁed  for speciﬁc  analyses);  sigma , the 
width of the Gaussian  distributions  of trial-speciﬁc  frequencies,  and 
kappa, the width of the von-Mises  distributions  of trial-speciﬁc  phases,  
follow a normal  distributions  (as shown in Fig. 1 E and H, respectively);  
the proportion  of valid trials in each participant  follows  a normal  distri- 
bution (as shown in Fig. 1 K). 
We initiated  the random-number  generator  with a unique seed for 
each simulation  run, and we simulated  each trial of each participant  in- 
dividually.  We started by constructing  the underlying  probability  func- 
tion of each trial, which expresses  the rhythmically  modulated  likeli- 
hood to detect a probe across diﬀerent  times after the aligning  event. 
We obtained  the trial-speciﬁc  target frequency  and the target phase 
randomly  drawing  from the frequency  and phase distributions  (distri- 
butions  shown in Fig. 1 F,I). The target frequency  was used to create 
a third order Butterworth  bandpass  ﬁlter with a passband  of ± 0.2 Hz 
around the target frequency.  Finally,  the underlying  probability  func- 
tion was generated  by ﬁltering  white noise (i.e., uncorrelated  samples  
uniformly  distributed  between  0 and 1). We discarded  suﬃcient  time 
(30 s) at the beginning  of the signal to allow the ﬁlter to settle to its 
steady state. After ﬁltering,  the resulting  signal was visibly oscillatory,  
but not perfectly  regular  like a sine wave, because  its phase did not 
progress  linearly  and its amplitude  was not constant.  The Hilbert trans- 
form was used to obtain the instantaneous  phase, and the start time 
was chosen by selecting  the sample that was closest to the target phase 
for that trial. From that moment  onward,  we extracted  1000 samples,  
corresponding  to 1 s, the total duration  of a trial. The amplitude  of 
the signal was scaled between  − 1 to 1, and multiplied  with the trial- 
speciﬁc  modulation-depth  value (obtained  by randomly  drawing  from 
the modulation-depth  distribution)  plus 0.5. This resulted  in an oscil- 
latory signal that ﬂuctuated  around 0.5 with extrema  approaching  0.5 
plus/minus  the modulation-depth  value. This signal then represented  
the underlying  probability  function  of detection  performance  for that 
trial. 
We call probe onset interval  (POI) the time between  the alignment  
event and the probe event, with the latter being the stimulus  event that 
participants  are supposed  to detect and report. The POI corresponds  to 
the stimulus  onset asynchrony  (SOA) of several previous  studies.  For 
each simulated  trial of each participant,  the POI was determined  as a 
random  time between  the alignment  event and the end of the trial, by 
drawing  it from a uniform  distribution  of values ranging  from 0.001 s to 
1 s in steps of 0.001 s. Note that in this process  we generate  an irregular  
sampling,  e.g., not all POIs are sampled  the same number  of times, and 
some POIs do not occur at all. 
Once a POI had been chosen for a trial, we looked up the value 
of that trial’s probability  function  at that POI time. We used the 
obtained  value as probability  in the following  Matlab function  call: 
“y = datasample([  − 1,1],1, ”weights  ”,[1-probability,probability])  “. Each 
such call gave a value of − 1 or 1, with the respective  probabilities  sum- 
ming to one. We refer to these outcome  options  as behavioral  response  
value (BRV) and we consider  a value of 1 to correspond  to a correct 
detection,  and a value of − 1 to correspond  to a missed detection.  
We simulated  400 trials per participant  (except  otherwise  noted).  
Only a subset of the trials were labeled  as “valid ”, as it is often the case 
in a real experiment.  In each participant,  trials had a certain random  
probability  to be labeled  as “valid ”. This participant-speciﬁc  probability  
was determined  by randomly  sampling  a Gaussian  distribution  of mean 
0.8 and sigma 0.07 (as shown in Fig. 1 J).

In this work, we used the empirical  connectomes  that we have al- 
ready published  elsewhere  ( Domhof  et al., 2021a ). This repository  con- 
tains the empirical  SC and FC matrices  of 200 healthy,  unrelated  subjects  
(96 males, 104 females,  aged 28.5 ± 3.5 years) from the Human  Connec-  
tome Project (HCP) S1200 release dataset ( Van Essen et al., 2013; 2012 ). 
The local ethics committee  of the HCP approved  the study, and the in- 
formed  consent  of all subjects  was collected.  The connectomes  were re- 
constructed  for 19 diﬀerent  parcellation  schemes,  where the original  
parcellation  images were ﬁrst modiﬁed  to increase  the comparability  of 
results across brain atlases.  In particular,  the modiﬁcations  ensured  the 
images only included  cortical  parcels and were sampled  to the MNI152  
non-linear  template  space ( Grabner  et al., 2006 ). 
We used the empirical  connectomes  of 8 representative  parcellations  
out of the available  19 brain parcellations  in order to put more em- 
phasis on varying  the parcellation  method  rather than the granularity.  
Table 1 displays  the ﬁnal selection  of parcellations.  Below we provide  
a brief explanation  on the derivation  of the empirical  SC and FC from 
the dwMRI  and fMRI data, respectively.  For a detailed  description  of the 
connectome  data, we refer to the data descriptor  included  in the reposi- 
tory ( Domhof  et al., 2021a ) and to the associated  paper ( Domhof  et al., 
2021b ). 
2.1.1. Empirical  structural  connectivity  
The reconstruction  of the empirical  SC matrices  from dwMRI  data 
was carried out by a workﬂow  developed  in-house  ( Jung et al., 
2021 ). The pipeline  can be regarded  as a wrapper  around functions  
included  in the software  packages  of ANTs ( Tustison  et al., 2010 ), 
FreeSurfer  ( Dale et al., 1999 ), FSL ( Jenkinson  et al., 2012 ) and MR- 
trix3 ( Tournier  et al., 2019 ), and is publicly  available  ( https://github.  
com/inm7/vbc  _ dwmri ). The result of the reconstruction  consisted  of the 
empirical  SC matrix with the number  of streamlines  between  all pairs of 
brain regions  and the empirical  path length (PL) matrix,  which included  
the average  lengths  of those streamlines.  For the details of the recon- 
struction  process,  we refer to the above repository  hosting  the workﬂow,  
to the data descriptor  of the data repository  ( Domhof  et al., 2021a ) and 
to the associated  paper ( Domhof  et al., 2021b ). 
In addition  to the subjects’  own (personalized)  empirical  SC and PL 
matrices,  we also derived  their grand-averages  per parcellation,  which 
is a common  practice  in modeling  studies ( Aquino  et al., 2022; Cabral 
et al., 2011; Deco et al., 2018b; Donnelly-Kehoe  et al., 2019; Iravani 
et al., 2021; Messé et  al., 2014; 2015 ). However,  by a straightforward  
averaging,  the unconnected  brain regions  may bias the grand-averaged  
path lengths  to lower values. Instead,  we considered  each edge of the 
empirical  SC and PL matrices  separately,  and determined  the medians

Fig. 1. Schematic  illustration  of the methodology  used in this study. The empirical  structural  connectivity  (SC) and the empirical  functional  connectivity  (FC) were 
calculated  from dwMRI and resting-state  fMRI data, respectively.  Dynamical  whole-brain  models were used to sample the simulated  FC matrices  that replicated  each 
individual  empirical  FC as close as possible  for every fMRI session by using the optimal model parameter  conﬁguration  𝑝 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡,𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  . This particular  conﬁguration  was 
obtained  by validating  the model (ﬁtting simulated  FC to empirical  FC) using a grid search in the parameter  space. Subsequently,  the upper triangles  of the empirical  
SC, empirical  FC and the corresponding  ﬁtted simulated  FC matrices  were correlated  between  diﬀerent  resting-state  fMRI sessions or subjects  to determine  their 
similarities.  Here, a distinction  was made between  three types of correlations.  (1) The correlations  evaluated  between  the same type of FC were named single-modal  
correlations  (blue arrows).  (2) Cross-modal  structure-function  correlations  (red arrows) were calculated  between  the empirical  SC and the empirical  or simulated  
FC. (3) Cross-modal  correlations  between  the empirical  and simulated  FC were termed model-ﬁt  correlations  (brown arrows).  All sessions participate  in within- 
and between-subject  comparisons,  but arrows in the ﬁgure are only fully shown for session 2 of subject 1 (center column of simulated  and empirical  FC). (For 
interpretation  of the references  to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred  to the web version of this article.) 
of the connected  edges across subjects.  This variation  from a straight-  
forward  averaging  does not yield qualitatively  diﬀerent  empirical  SC 
matrices,  but yields a more accurate  estimation  of the grand-averaged  
physical  distance  the signals have to travel; see supplementary  Fig. S1 
for illustration.  
2.1.2. Empirical  functional  connectivity  
The empirical  FC matrices  were calculated  from the ICA- 
FIX preprocessed  resting-state  fMRI data as included  in the HCP 
dataset ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ). First, the mean intensity  of the resting-  
state blood-oxygen-level-dependent  (BOLD)  signal was calculated  across 
all voxels of a given brain region included  in the considered  parcella-  
tion, which resulted  in one BOLD signal time series for each parcel. The 
resulting  BOLD signals were recently  published  in a separate  dataset as 
well ( Domhof  et al., 2022 ). Subsequently,  the time series were linearly  
detrended  and z-scored.  Eventually,  the empirical  FC was derived  from 
the time series by calculating  the Pearson  correlation  coeﬃcients  across 
the time series for all pairs of brain regions.  
For all considered  subjects,  the HCP dataset provided  4 resting-state  
fMRI sessions  (left-to-right  and right-to-left  phase encoding  directions  
scanned  on 2 days) comprising  1200 volumes  each (TR = 720 ms). We 
thus calculated  4 diﬀerent  realizations  of the empirical  FC per subject.  
These separate  instances  of the empirical  FC for every individual  subject 
enabled  us to estimate  the reliability  of the empirical  FC and hence that 
of the corresponding  ﬁtted simulated  FC and the respective  ﬁtted model 
parameters  as well.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(11475, 11480), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(6605, 6611), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119290,"2.1. Multidimensional  dMRI 
Multidimensional  dMRI, also known as 𝑞-space trajectory  imaging  
(QTI) ( Eriksson  et al., 2013; Westin et al., 2016 ), probes a trajectory  
𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) , rather than a point in the diﬀusion  𝑞-space, within a single mea- 
surement.  In other words, QTI treats the dMRI signal as a functional  of 
𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) , rather than a function  of 𝒒 , which results in the signal being sensi- 
tive to displacements  along multiple  dimensions  simultaneously.  
For Gaussian  diﬀusion,  the picture gets simpliﬁed,  as the cumulant  
series is truncated  at the level of the second-order  velocity  cumulant  
⟨𝑣 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑣 𝑗 ( 𝑡 ′) ⟩= 2 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 𝛿( 𝑡 − 𝑡 ′) deﬁning  the diﬀusion  tensor 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 . Hence, the signal 
𝑆[ 𝒒 ( 𝑡 )] = ⟨𝑒 𝑖 ∫d 𝑡 𝒒 ( 𝑡 ) ⋅𝐯 ( 𝑡 ) ⟩= 𝑒 − ∑
𝑖𝑗 𝐵 𝑖𝑗 𝐷 𝑖𝑗 (1) 
gets reduced  to a function  of the 3 ×3 symmetric  tensor 𝑩 = ( 𝐵 𝑖𝑗 ) : 
𝐵 𝑖𝑗 = ∫TE 
0 𝑞 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑞 𝑗 ( 𝑡 ) d 𝑡, with 
𝑞 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) = ∫𝑡 
0 𝑔 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ′) d 𝑡 ′, and 𝑏 = ∑
𝑖 𝐵 𝑖𝑖 , (2) 
where the trace of 𝑩 is the conventional  𝑏 -value 2 , and 𝐠 ( 𝑡 ) = d 𝒒 ∕d 𝑡 is the 
diﬀusion  gradient  waveform  used to generate  the trajectory.  Hence, for a 
medium  ( e.g. , a voxel) comprised  of multiple  non-exchanging  Gaussian-  
diﬀusion  compartments  (in general,  anisotropic,  such as in the SM), the 
𝑩 -tensor fully parametrizes  the measurement.  
The number  of nonzero  eigenvalues  in 𝑩 reﬂects  how many dimen- 
sions of the anisotropic  Gaussian  diﬀusion  are being probed simultane-  
ously. In this work, we focus on axially symmetric  𝑩 : 
𝐵 𝑖𝑗 ( 𝑏, 𝛽, ̂𝐮 ) = 𝑏 ( 
𝛽𝑢 𝑖 𝑢 𝑗 + 1 − 𝛽
3 𝛿𝑖𝑗 ) 
(3) 
that are parametrized  by the overall scale (the 𝑏 -value),  the unit vector 
̂𝒖 along the symmetry  axis, and the adimensional  shape parameter  𝛽
( Fig. 2 a). Compared  to conventional  dMRI, the extra degree of freedom  
𝛽represents  the 𝑩 -tensor shape, e.g. , 𝛽= 1 for linear encoding  (a single 
nonzero  eigenvalue),  𝛽= 0 for spherical  encoding  (isotropic  𝑩 -tensor),  
and 𝛽= − 1 
2 for planar encoding  (two nonzero  eigenvalues).  Here 𝛿𝑖𝑗 is 
the Kronecker  symbol  (the unit matrix).  
The encoding  time required  for the gradient  waveforms  correspond-  
ing to a given 𝑩 -tensor depends  on its shape and b-value.  Fig. 2 b shows 
the minimum  diﬀusion  encoding  times for { 𝑏, 𝛽} combinations  given 
speciﬁc  hardware  constraints  (more details in Section  3.1 ). Isotropic  
weighting  and large 𝑏 -values demand  more encoding  time if gradient  
hardware  constraints  are kept constant.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14370, 14375), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2518, 2524), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118825,"2.1. Univoxel  versus multivoxel  eﬀects 
Better classiﬁcation  performance  using MVPA can be a trivial con- 
sequence  of the fact that classiﬁcation  is always a monotonically  non- 
decreasing  function  of the number  of voxels in a searchlight  ( Fig. 1 A). As 
can be seen increasing  the number  of voxels results in larger Crossnobis  
distance  ( Nili et al., 2020 ) across two conditions  and thereby  improv-  
ing classiﬁcation  accuracy  for any classiﬁer  such as linear discriminant  
analysis  (LDA) ( Misaki et al., 2010 ) (see Section  4 ) ( Fig. 1 B). It can be ar- 
gued that almost all previously  reported  MVPA results could arise from 
a mere increase  in sensitivity  which is expected  when combining  a large 
number  of ‘weak classiﬁers’  (i.e. single voxels) within searchlights  and 
solving  the classiﬁcation  in a higher-dimensional  space ( Haxby et al., 
2001; Kamitani  and Tong, 2005; Tong and Pratte, 2012 ). 
While such results may be used as evidence  for the spatial spread 
of coding beyond  a single voxel, they hardly address  whether  there is 
coordinated  activity  between  voxels that are diﬀerent  across conditions.  
Note that the spatial spread of coding is also often readily observed  using 
simple univariate  GLMs unless voxels in the searchlight  show mostly 
subthreshold  activations  that can only reach signiﬁcance  when MVPA 
is used (again via increasing  sensitivity  by using a large number  of ‘weak 
classiﬁers’).  
As a result in many studies,  it has been a challenge  to determine  to 
what degree the results of MVPA are simply a byproduct  of UVE as op- 
posed to representing  a real MVE code ( Coutanche,  2013; Hebart and 
Baker, 2018 ). Several  studies have assumed  that in general  if voxels 
show similar activation  across conditions  (e.g. increased  or decreased  
activation  in all voxels between  two conditions),  MVPA is simply a 
byproduct  of multiple  UVEs ( Coutanche,  2013; Hebart and Baker, 2018 ) 
and on the other hand, when there is diﬀerential  activity  across vox- 
els across task conditions,  the activation  pattern  is assumed  to repre- 
sent a real MVE code. Fig. 1 C shows a graphical  representation  of UVE 
and MVE according  to the aforementioned  interpretation  for two voxels 
across two conditions.  MVPA activations  are interpreted  as UVE when 
activation  changes  are largely similar for both voxels across the two con- 
ditions (i.e. activation  falling on the unity line which represents  equal 
sensitivity,  UVE axis). In this scenario,  MVE is a component  that is added to the UVE in the direction  perpendicular  to the UVE axis. In reality, the 
actual activation  of our two example  voxels can show a mixture  of both 
UVE and MVE ( Fig. 1 C right). A conventional  method  employed  to re- 
move UVE from MVE is then to remove  the part of the eﬀect that has 
the same sign and amplitude  across all voxels ( Hebart and Baker, 2018; 
Nili et al., 2020 ) ( Fig. 1 D). This procedure  is separately  performed  for 
each condition.  In the geometric  sense, MVE is extracted  by shifting  all 
samples  in each condition  such that the sum of voxel values for each 
sample becomes  zero ( Hebart and Baker, 2018 ). 
Unfortunately,  such interpretation  of MVPA can be erroneous  for 
at least two reasons:  (1) Current  UVE interpretation  implicitly  assumes  
equal sensitivity  to conditions  across voxels. However,  it is well-known  
that a given voxel’s sensitivity  to task conditions  can be aﬀected  by a va- 
riety of factors not related to neural activity  per se, including  imaging  
sequence  used, RF coil function  and positioning,  subject motion,  dif- 
ferences  in local susceptibility  and partial volume  eﬀect. In the other 
words, non-neural  sources  can cause some voxels to show lower or 
higher sensitivity  to condition  1 versus condition  2 ( Fig. 1 C right panel) 
and thus multidimensional  responses  to fall out of unity line. Such diﬀer- 
ential sensitivity  across voxels can be taken as evidence  for MVE as op- 
posed to UVE in the absence  of a meaningful  neural correlate.  (2) More 
importantly  from a computational  standpoint  and as far as informational  
content  or decoding  is concerned,  conditions  with pure UVE and pure 
MVE (current  formulations  as shown in Fig. 1 C) are not qualitatively  
diﬀerent.  In our two voxel examples,  pure UVE can be transformed  to 
pure MVE by an aﬃne transformation  of voxel activities  ( Fig. 1 E). Im- 
portantly  and as expected  such linear transformations  do not change the 
informational  content  or decoding  accuracy  regardless  of which name 
(UVE or MVE) one chooses  for describing  the observed  pattern.  
On the other hand, we argue that a true coordinated  and joint multi- 
voxel code which posits functional  cross-voxel  interactions  across con- 
ditions entails changes  in higher-order  cross-voxel  statistics.  Such cross- 
voxel interaction  entangles  response  ﬂuctuations  across voxels within 
trials. This alternative  formulation  is consistent  with a more precise 
deﬁnition  which suggests  that a ‘true’ population  code should be rep- 
resented  in coordinated  activity  between  members  within a given trial 
and not just their mean across trials ( Elsayed  and Cunningham,  2017 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(7574, 7579), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5350, 5356), match='\n2.2. '>"

The goal of pulse sequence  optimization  in this work is to select a 
combination  of sequence  parameters  that provides  optimal  image char- 
acteristics  for a desirable  resolution,  ﬁeld of view (FOV), and the total 
imaging  time pre-determined  based on the application  at hand. Such a 
process  can be formulated  into a multi-variable  numerical  optimization  
problem  with parameters  including  repetition  time (TR), inversion  time 
(TI), excitation  ﬂip angle (FA), and receive  bandwidth  (BW) as input 
variables.  The optimal  parameters  can be deﬁned  as those which max- 
imize an objective  function  representing  certain desirable  image char- 
acteristics.  With FGATIR,  a saturated  WM signal and a high GM to WM 
contrast-to-noise  ratio (CNR) is desirable.  Without  considering  the ef- 
fect of transmit  RF ﬁeld inhomogeneity,  FGATIR  optimization  can be 
formulated  into the following  constrained  optimization:

images,  assuming  uniform  B1 + ﬁeld; 𝛿is a small constant  number  that 
controls  the relative  signal strength  of WM compared  with GM. Note 
that a small 𝛿forces WM signal to be suppressed,  which is a key fea- 
ture of FGATIR.  Based on our experience,  a value around 0.02 is suf- 
ﬁcient to limit the WM signal, and is therefore  used in this work. Too 
large of a value of 𝛿will introduce  residual  WM signal and compromise  
the contrast,  while an even smaller  𝛿no longer causes a major impact.  
𝑇 𝑅 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a constant  determined  by the preset total scan time limit. For 
a given number  of total k-space  lines, the total imaging  time increases  
as TR increases.  Since longitudinal  magnetization  of brain tissues evolve 
throughout  the data acquisition  window,  the signal strengths  at the cen- 
ter of k-space  are commonly  used as surrogates  for GM and WM sig- 
nal levels in images.  Under this assumption,  the 𝑆 𝑊 𝑀 
𝐵 +

𝐵 +

be taken as the signal levels at the center of data acquisition  window,  
which is aligned  with the k-space  center, and can be calculated  through  
Bloch equation  simulation  based on the sequence  parameters  being used 
(i.e., TR, TI, FA, BW) as described  in ( Deichmann  and Haase, 1992 ) and 
( Marques  et al., 2010 ). Details of the signal expressions  of WM and GM 
are given in Appendix.  To illustrate  these concepts,  Fig. 1 shows how 
the GM and WM longitudinal  magnetizations  evolve throughout  a TR 
cycle and demonstrates  how the center of the acquisition  window  (red 
bar) is placed around the WM null point to suppress  WM signal. 
Next, 𝜎0 ( Eq. (2) ) is the baseline  image noise level, whose absolute  
value does not aﬀect the outcome  of optimization  and is therefore  set 
as 1 for convenience.  Eq. (2) . accounts  for the eﬀect of BW on image 
noise, and the CNR is scaled by √
𝑇 𝑅 to yield the normalized  CNR per 
unit scan time.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(8154, 8159), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(4137, 4143), match='\n2.2. '>"

Dang et al. (2022) were interested  in characterizing  the neural cor- 
relates of mentalizing  , deﬁned  as the ability to infer motivations,  goals, 
intentions,  and feelings  of other social agents ( Dang et al., 2022 ). They 
analyzed  neural activity  in three regions  of interest  (ROI): the supe- 
rior temporal  sulcus, (STS), the temporo-parietal  junction  (TPJ), and the 
dorsomedial  prefrontal  cortex (DMPFC).  Results supported  the authors’  
hypothesis  that brain regions  involved  in mentalizing  –the TPJ and bi- 
lateral STS –s h o w  greater activation  when study participants  viewed  
Black (vs. White) civilians  involved  in more aggressive  police encoun-  
ters. They conclude  that their participant  sample – racially  egalitarian  
white Americans  –m a y be attuned  to racial injustice  and mentalizing  
could reﬂect participants’  inferences  about the goals, motivations  and 
intentions  of the police oﬃcers  in the videos. 
In the United States, the police account  for approximately  
6% of all full-time  employees  for state and local governments  
( USAfacts.org,  2021 ) and many of their routine  responsibilities  do not 
involve  public interactions.  Yet, over the last few years, the United States 
has been rocked by high-proﬁle  incidents  involving  police oﬃcers’  use of 
force, particularly  against  Black civilians.  And while racial discrimina-  
tion in systems  of policing  is not new ( Eberhardt  et al., 2006 ; Jacobs and 
O’Brien,  1998 ; Rucker and Richeson,  2021 ), the public is increasingly  
exposed  to bystander  videos of police-civilian  interactions.  Such videos 
allow citizens  the opportunity  to observe  and draw inferences  about

on institutional  trust ( Camp et al., 2021 ; Voigt et al., 2017 ), Dang et al ’s 
study is timely and important.  
In our view, this is a solid study with a sound research  design on an 
understudied  topic in social neuroscience.  Dang et al. carefully  balance  
the use of real arrest footage  (i.e., taken from the TV reality show Cops 
between  1991 and 2017) with standardization  of the clips on several 
dimensions  including  level of aggression,  attractiveness  of the people 
in the video, and pleasantness/dangerousness  of background  scenes. As 
noted, their participant  sample is approximately  twice as large as stan- 
dard fMRI experiments.  Their supplementary  analyses  attempt  to ad- 
dress alternative  explanations.  Dang et al. were careful when interpret-  
ing their ﬁndings,  which is particularly  important  when investigating  
sensitive  topics like police-civilian  cross-race  interactions.  
However,  this research  illustrates  the challenges  of integrating  re- 
search on complex  social interactions,  race and aggression,  motivated  
ideology,  social cognition,  and functional  neuroanatomy.  On the one 
hand, Dang et al. show social interactions  are too complex  to gain new 
insight on functional  neuroanatomy.  On the other hand, the participant  
sample is too conceptually  narrow  to gain novel insights  on social psy- 
chological  theories  of racial bias. We outline these challenges  below.

The experiment  was conducted  in a 4-layer MSR with the participant  
sitting on a plastic chair facing a screen. An image was projected  onto 
the screen through  a wave-guide  using a projector  placed outside  the 
MSR. Each trial started with the presentation  of a ﬁxation  cross (white 
on black background)  for 7–8 s (randomly  jittered  across trials). When 
the ﬁxation  cross changed  colour from white to red, the participant  was instructed  to lift up their right index ﬁnger and perform  a rapid tapping  
motion in the air for 2.5 s, until the ﬁxation  cross changed  colour back 
to white. This was repeated  for a total of 100 trials. The participant  was 
instructed  to remain seated and to keep as still as possible  during the 
recording.

Thirty-nine  participants  took part in the present  study, which is part 
of an ongoing  longitudinal  study of dyslexia.  Children  were aged on 
average  7-8 years when the study began (2018).  The current  sample 
comprised  all those children  from the total cohort of 121 children  who 
volunteered  for neuroimaging  (two further control volunteers  were ex- 
cluded as they were signiﬁcantly  younger).  We report MEG data from 
20 age-matched  controls  (CA group) and a group of 19 dyslexic  children  
(DY group),  see Table 1 for details.  Due to interruptions  to the research  
necessitated  by COVID-19,  the CA volunteers  were slightly  younger  than 
the DY group once data collection  was completed,  even though these 
groups are well-matched  for age in the larger cohort. All children  were 
native speakers  of British English.  Children  with dyslexia  were recruited

2.1.1. Dataset 
To illustrate  how the temporal  correlation  of two signals changes  
with altered hemodynamics  that delay and decrease  the magni- 
tude of the signal, a simulation  study was performed  using an 
actual resting-state  fMRI (rsfMRI)  signal combined  with a varied 
amount  of simulated  noise. The signal time course was originally  
from the WU-Minn  HCP young healthy  adults (ages 22–35) S1200 
release data ( https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-  
adult ). The data of 100 runs from 50 subjects  (32 women;  average  age: 
29.4 ± 3.3 years) who underwent  15 min 3.0-T rsfMRI sessions  (with 
a repetition  time [TR] of 0.72 s) without  quality control issues, whose 
mean framewise  displacement  was less than 0.2 mm, which had been 
minimally  processed  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ), were subjected  to the follow- 
ing analyses.  
2.1.2. Simulation  
After subject-level  independent  component  analysis  (ICA) noise re- 
duction  (sICA + FIX) ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 
2014 ), spatial smoothing  with a Gaussian  kernel with an 8 mm full- 
width at half-maximum,  and linear trend removal  and band-pass  ﬁl- tering at 0.01–0.1  Hz, concatenated  data having 120,000  time points 
(1200 frames ×50 subjects  ×2 phase-encoding  directions)  were sub- 
jected to group-wise  spatial ICA. The ﬁrst ICA component,  primarily  
representing  the medial visual cortex’s  time series 𝑆( 𝑡 ) , was used. The 
data were up-sampled  to a resolution  of 0.072 s (1/10 TR). A pair of 
random  Gaussian  noises, 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 , with a mean of 0 and lasting for 
1,200,000  time points, were generated  and subjected  to the band-pass  
ﬁltering  at 0.01–0.1  Hz. 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 were scaled to have a standard  
deviation  of 1/5, 2/5, and 3/5 of the signal component,  𝑆. The time 
series were de-concatenated  into 100 segments  to perform  the analysis  
for each run separately.  Two time series, 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 , having the same 
signal and diﬀerent  noise components,  were prepared.  The vascular  ef- 
fect was examined  by changing  the magnitude  𝑚 and time delay 𝜕of the 
signal component  𝑆only for 𝑋1 as follows:  
𝑋1 = 𝑚 ∗ 𝑆 ( 𝑡 − 𝜕 ) + 𝑘 ∗ 𝑁1 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 (1) 
𝑋2 = 𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑘 ∗ 𝑁2 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 (2) 
where 𝑘 represents  the noise magnitude  factor. 𝑋1 was arranged  on a 
60 ×60 grid, with the magnitude  𝑚 and time delay 𝜕varied progressively  
along the x- and y-axes from 0 to − 80% and 0 to 6 seconds  in equal 
decrements  and increments,  respectively  ( Fig. 1 ). For each of the n ( = 
100) runs, Pearson’s  correlation  coeﬃcients  𝑅 between  𝑋1 and 𝑋2 were 
computed  for 𝑖 ∗ 𝑗time series and averaged  across 𝑛 runs for each noise 
factor 𝑘 as follows:  
𝑅 𝑘 ( 𝑖, 𝑗 ) = 1

To establish  changes  occurring  during pregnancy,  brain measures  
were taken before pregnancy  and compared  to measures  taken dur- 
ing pregnancy  and/or after giving birth. Out of the 12 studies con- 
ducted,  ﬁve included  time points before pregnancy  ( Carmona  et al., 
2019 ; Hoekzema  et al., 2017 , 2020 ; Martinez-Garcia  et al., 2021 ; 
Oatridge  et al., 2002 ), albeit one of those ( Martinez-Garcia  et al., 2021 ) 
was an extension  of a previous  study ( Hoekzema  et al., 2017 ), with an 
extra time point added at six years after giving birth. Thus, it does not 
provide  any additional  insights  beyond  the initial study with respect to 
changes  during pregnancy.  As summarized  in Table 3 and Fig. 1 , the 
remaining  four studies reported  that pregnancy  is accompanied  by in- 
creases in total sulcal width ( Carmona  et al., 2019 ) and in the size of the 
ventricles  ( Oatridge  et al., 2002 ). Furthermore,  there are decreases  in total brain size ( Oatridge  et al., 2002 ), decreases  in total cortical  thick- 
ness, cortical  surface area, gyriﬁcation,  sulcal depth, and sulcal length 
( Carmona  et al., 2019 ), decreases  in the volume  of the ventral striatum  
( Hoekzema  et al., 2020 ), as well as decreases  in voxel-wise  gray mat- 
ter volume,  point-wise  cortical  thickness,  and point-wise  cortical  surface 
area across the brain ( Hoekzema  et al., 2017 ); for speciﬁc  cluster loca- 
tions, please refer to Table 4 . These described  changes  are all compatible

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119056,"2.1. Human factors 
Scientists  are trained  to form beliefs about the world and test their 
theoretical  and experimental  hypotheses  with objectivity.  However,  
even expert humans  are fallible,  as they can be victims  of their own bi- ases and, consequently,  make logical errors. GSP can help mitigate  these 
errors by making  researchers  aware of them, by explicitly  accounting  
for biases in data analysis  and representation,  and by enforcing  careful 
planning  of experiments,  with attention  to the logical implications  of 
given observations.  
2.1.1. Cognitive  biases, their manifestation,  and ways to mitigate  them 
Cognitive  biases pervade  all levels of thinking  and reasoning,  from 
low level perceptual  processes  to social representations.  Because  cogni- 
tive capacities  are limited,  humans  allocate  resources  sparingly  and cre- 
ate mental shortcuts  (heuristics)  that are prone to oversights  and biases 
( Gigerenzer,  2008 ). Of note here are the biases that cause researchers  
to perceive  or understand  information  incorrectly  during data analysis  
and viewing,  and end up drawing  inaccurate  conclusions.  We illustrate  
a few eﬀects and mention  strategies  to help overcome  these biases. 
At the perceptual  level, researchers  have to grapple  with sensory  
errors and visual illusions  both when reading  and when creating  visual 
data representations.  The limits and strengths  of the visual system for ex- 
tracting  information  from such visual representations  are well studied,  
and detailed  guidelines  exist: see Franconeri  et al. (2021) for a recent 
review.  
A prominent  example  in the ﬁeld of brain imaging  in general,  and 
MEEG in particular,  is the question  of color mapping.  Because  human 
perception  of color categories  is neither  linear nor equal across the color 
wheel ( Bae et al., 2014 ), the choice of how to represent  continuous  data 
with color is not trivial. The rainbow  color map, widely used in the ﬁeld, 
unfortunately  does not take perceptual  limitations  into account  and can 
lead to perceiving  inaccurate  steps in the data, or meaningless  categor-  
ical boundaries  ( Cooper  et al., this issue ; Borland  and Taylor II, 2007 ). 
Instead,  there are now perceptually  uniform  colormaps  that ensure that 
the linear representation  of data is correctly  perceived  by human ob- 
servers.  See Cooper  et al. (this issue) , for a review and suggestions.  An- 
other example  is how results can be distorted  when not visualized  prop- 
erly, hiding underlying  patterns  in the raw data ( Chambers  et al., 2018 ; 
Ware, 2019 ; Allen et al., 2021 ). Therefore,  it is recommended  to present  
more complete  visual representations  such as box and density  plots 
that reﬂect the entire distribution  of the underlying  data rather than 
focusing  on its central tendency  ( Hintze and Nelson,  1998 ; Rodu and 
Kafadar,  2021 ). 
Beyond  individual  perceptual  errors, other types of errors can oc- 
cur when viewing  data in a social context.  A well-known  example  is 
the “curse of knowledge  ”e ﬀ e c t ,  whereby  personal  experience  and fa- 
miliarity  with a method,  theory, or set of results make the presenter  as- 
sume more knowledge  in the audience  than there actually  is Xiong et al. 
(2020) . This is almost always the case when researchers  present  their 
own work, and may thus lead to a miscommunication  between  presen-  
ter and observer.  This disparity  may be further increased  due to the 
fact that, on the observer’s  side, their high-level  experiences  inﬂuence  
their interpretation  and even low-level  perceptual  processing  of objec- 
tive information.  This can aﬀect the reading  and understanding  of MEEG 
data, especially  when it is likely that an experimental  result strongly  sup- 
ports or refutes one’s own theoretical  predictions.  In combination  with 
the conﬁrmation  bias, the same viewer may be inclined  to ignore data 
features  that refute their own theoretical  views. There is a plethora  of 
higher-order  cognitive  biases that aﬀect decision  making  at many lev- 
els. Commenting  on all of them is beyond  the scope of the present  arti- 
cle, but their powerful  eﬀect on perception  and understanding  is impor- 
tant to consider  at all stages of a research  project.  The interested  reader 
could consult  references  such as Baron (2006) or the seminal  works of 
Tversky  and Kahneman  (1974) . 
Finally,  social factors also inﬂuence  the socio-cultural  structure  
of scientiﬁc  investigation,  and inﬂuence  scientiﬁc  progress  in a way 
that may be biased toward theories  and representations  of the most- 
represented  social groups.  The majority  of publications  in MEEG re- 
search come from Western  institutions  that recruit so-called  W.E.I.R.D.  
(Western,  Educated,  Industrialized,  Rich, and Democratic)  participants,  
3  G. Niso, L.R. Krol et al NeuroImage  257 (2022) 119056 
putting  into question  whether  these study results generalize  to a 
larger population  ( Henrich  et al., 2010 ). Researchers  must keep this 
in mind when reading  past work, designing  new studies,  and describ-  
ing their own experimental  conclusions.  Lack of diversity  and inclu- 
sion is prevalent  in academia,  and the MEEG ﬁeld is no exception  
to this ( Schrouﬀ et  al., 2019 ). Gender  bias, as well as marginaliza-  
tion and underrepresentation  of racial, ethnic, and cultural  minorities,  
aﬀect women,  BIPOC (black, indigenous,  and other people of color) 
and people with disabilities,  not only as students  and scientists,  but 
also in participant  samples.  Some relevant  resources  and concrete  ac- 
tions to mitigate  gender bias and inequity  at individual  and institu- 
tional levels in academia  have been collected  recently  ( Schreiweis  et al., 
2019 ; Llorens  et al., 2021 ; Levitis et al., 2021 ). As suggested  by 
Dworkin  et al. (2020) , Zurn et al. (2020) we have included  a cita- 
tion diversity  statement  at the end of the manuscript  for the aware- 
ness of citation  bias in the literature.  In the ﬁeld of EEG, recent studies 
have begun to address  the fact that standard  EEG electrodes  are not 
designed  to accommodate  coarse and curly hair common  in individu-  
als of African  descent  ( Etienne  et al., 2020 ; Choy et al., 2021 ). This 
is an important  reminder  that systemic  bias can also occur through  
instrumentation.  
2.1.2. Logical thinking  and fallacious  reasoning:  an example  
Cognitive  biases aﬀect perception,  cognition,  and reasoning  in sci- 
ence, but fallacious  conclusions  can also be reached  due to a failure to 
fully understand  and account  for the logical implications  of an experi- 
mental work. Logical  thinking  is at the heart of conceiving  hypotheses  
and designing  experiments.  Experimenters  need to take certain steps at 
the outset to forestall  later mistakes  when drawing  conclusions  from re- 
sults. See Sinnott-Armstrong  and Simmons  (2021) for a list of common  
fallacies  in MEEG data. 
Some common  mistakes  can be illustrated  by misinterpretations  of 
Libet and collaborators  ( Libet et al., 1983 ). In this now infamous  EEG 
experiment,  participants  were positioned  in front of a clock face, and 
were instructed  to freely move their ﬁngers or wrists at a time of 
their choosing.  When they did decide to move, they were asked to re- 
port the time when the decision  was made. As such, the experiment  
yielded  three points in time: the self-reported  time of the conscious  
will or decision  to move (W), the measured  time that movement  in- 
deed took place (M), and correlated  brain activity  in the EEG in the 
form of a readiness  potential  (RP). They found that the readiness  po- 
tential RP occurred  before the reported  time of W, which in turn oc- 
curred before M. Libet’s ﬁndings  have been replicated  often, but there 
are still raging debates  about their interpretation,  the role of the neural 
activity  (RP) and W in producing  M, and any relation  of these ﬁnd- 
ings to free will. Unfortunately,  these debates  continue  to involve  sev- 
eral fallacies  that could have been avoided  by following  these simple 
recommendations.  
First, spell out all theories  or hypotheses  that might explain  possible  
experimental  ﬁndings.  Overlooking  an option can lead to a fallacy called 
false dichotomy  . For example,  commentators  on Libet et al. (1983) of- 
ten assumed  that one of only three options  must be true: (a) W causes 
M, but nothing  causes W (Libertarianism);  (b) W causes an RP, which 
causes M (Backwards  Causation);  or (c) RP causes M, but W does not 
cause M (Libet’s  conclusion).  Libet’s followers  rejected  the Libertarian  
claim, because  they assumed  that every event has a cause. They also 
rejected  Backwards  Causation,  because  W occurs later than RP, and 
causes never come after their eﬀects. They concluded  that RP causes 
M, but W does not cause M. What they failed to consider  was the Com- 
monsense  view that RP causes W, and then W in turn causes M —that 
is, activity  in the brain causes choices,  which cause actions.  To over- 
look such a plausible  option is called false dichotomy  because  it is false 
to assume  that one member  of the original  set of alternatives  must be 
true. 
Second,  think carefully  about which theories  or hypotheses  are log- 
ically compatible  with others. Forgetting  that both of two supposed  al- ternatives  might be true can lead to a fallacy called aﬃrming  a disjunct  . 
Some readers  of Libet et al. (1983) seem to reason that either RP causes 
M or W causes M, so, if RP causes M, then W does not cause M (cf Sinnott-  
Armstrong,  2011 ). However,  this reasoning  is fallacious  because  RP and 
W might both cause M, such as when RP, W, and M form a chain of 
causes across time. 
Third, deﬁne the precise category  that the conclusion  will cover and 
include  stimuli or tasks for all variations  within that category.  Failing 
to include  a subclass  of the phenomenon  can lead to a fallacy called 
hasty generalization  . An experiment  using a speciﬁc  kind of action can- 
not justify a conclusion  about all actions,  especially  when the studied  
acts are atypical.  In particular,  Libet’s subjects  arbitrarily  chose when to 
ﬂex their wrists with nothing  at stake. What Libet found about these ar- 
bitrary,  simple,  trivial acts might not hold for important  human actions 
that are based on conscious  deliberation  and require  complex  sequences.  
If one wants to draw a conclusion  about all actions,  one must be sure to 
include  diverse  kinds of actions in the experimental  data itself. 
How can one know whether  one has included  enough  kinds of test 
alternatives,  considered  enough  theories,  and speciﬁed  competitors  that 
cannot both be true? The best way to minimize  the chances  of these and 
other mistakes  is to seek early feedback  from others, especially  those 
who disagree  with one’s views and assumptions.  This includes  people 
from other ﬁelds and backgrounds.  Working  together  instead  of alone 
is of great beneﬁt:  today’s team science  activities  have shown these ad- 
vantages  (see examples  in Section  2.3 ). 
2.1.3. Example  strategy  to minimize  biases and errors 
Experiencing  cognitive  biases or logical fallacies  and having them 
inﬂuence  research  at least in part may be inevitable,  but it is possible  
to diminish  their impact on research  practices  by learning  about them 
and by using concerted  “slow ”critical  thinking  skills ( Kahneman,  2013 ). 
Appendix  Table A1 has a few current  references  on ways to characterize  
and circumvent  biases and errors. 
One possible  strategy  is to organize  a “premortem  meeting  ”w i t h 
fellow researchers  before starting  a new project ( Klein, 2007 ). This ex- 
ercise involves  simulating  a future meeting,  assuming  the project has 
failed, and then working  backwards  from that outcome  to determine  
what could have caused that “failure  ”. This meeting  can include  a fo- 
cused conversation  about existing  biases and beliefs within the group 
that might inﬂuence  the work, and then use imaginative  exercises  to 
collaboratively  solve these issues. As researchers  plan and implement  
their study, it is important  to keep track of which methods  are being 
chosen and why (see also Section  2.2 . below).  At this stage, researchers  
are encouraged  to document  which rationales  may be biased and how. 
Skepticism  is healthy  in science;  listening  to data is critical,  and trying 
to understand  both how data do, or do not ﬁt in with existing  theories  
is GSP. A useful set of guidelines  come from Abelson’s  MAGIC  Criteria  
( Abelson,  1995 ), which can be used to understand  the Magnitude,  Artic- 
ulation,  Generality,  Interestingness,  and Credibility  of statistical  claims in 
research.  For the many reasons  listed in the chapter,  once researchers  
are comfortable  operating  within a scientiﬁc  paradigm,  it becomes  espe- 
cially challenging  to shift their beliefs. But in order to progress  science  
fairly, they must be willing to do so. 
Highlights  2.1 . Human  factors  
•Perceptual  and cognitive  biases inﬂuence  how researchers  per- 
ceive, interpret,  and communicate  data and ideas. Awareness  
is the ﬁrst step towards  mitigation.  
•Careful  planning  and reasoning  can help reduce logical falla- 
cies concerning  hypotheses,  relevant  theories,  and conclusions.  
•Collective  exercises  such as a “premortem  meeting  ”c a n help 
highlight  pitfalls and correct mistakes  before they are made 
during an experimental  project.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118920,"2.1. Data and participants  
We used the data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Van Essen et al., 2012 ) for all subsequent  analyses.  The dataset includes  
functional  and structural  minimally  pre-processed  ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ) 
scans (1200 subjects  release).  
We included  participants  that performed  all the relevant  behavioral  
and cognitive  tests (see G-score  construction,  Section  2.6 ), and com- pleted all the resting-state  and task fMRI sessions,  barring  the Motor 
task, which was left out of further analysis  due to its weak contribution  
to the prediction  of intelligence  ( Sripada  et al., 2020 ), and the low speci- 
ﬁcity of its connTask  maps ( Tavor et al., 2016 ). These criteria  resulted  
in a dataset of 847 participants.  
All acquisition  parameters  and image processing  pipelines  are de- 
scribed  in detail in Glasser  et al (2013) . Brieﬂy,  all fMRI data (rest and 
task alike) were scanned  with a TR of 0.72s. Each participant  included  
in this study had four resting-state  fMRI runs with a total of 1,200 time- 
points per run, and performed  all necessary  tasks fMRI scans. 
As part of the HCP’s pre-processing  procedure,  all functional  
data were de-noised  using FMRIB’s  ICA-based  Xnoiseiﬁer  (FIX) 
( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014 ; Salimi-Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), which identiﬁes  in- 
dependent  components  of structured  artefacts  in the data, and regresses  
them out. This is the standard  method  for nuisance  regression  in the 
HCP. This procedure  ensures  that the “cleaned  ”d a t a is minimally  af- 
fected by noise sources  such as white-matter  signal or motion eﬀects, 
as these are represented  as noise components  and are regressed  out of 
the data. The “cleaned  ”data was then resampled  and “projected  ”onto 
a surface representation  consisting  of 91,282 ""grayordinates""  in stan- 
dard space. Data were aligned  and registered  using Multimodal  Surface  
Matching  (MSMAll)  ( Robinson  et al., 2018 ). 
As for the task fMRI, data provided  by the HCP were already  post- 
processed  and included  statistical  analysis.  All tasks in the HCP were 
performed  in a block-design  manner,  and activity  estimates  were com- 
puted for the time series from preprocessed  functional  scans using FSL’s 
FILM (FMRIB’s  Improved  Linear Model with autocorrelation  correction)  
( Woolrich  et al., 2001 ). “Blocks  ”of each type of stimuli included  in each 
task, were convolved  with a double gamma  canonical  hemodynamic  re- 
sponse function  ( Glover,  1999 ) to generate  the main model regressors.  
All tasks were performed  twice, and the statistical  maps provided  by 
the HCP are the result of the second level analysis,  that provides  a mean 
result for each contrast  across both runs. 
The Working  Memory  task included  405 time-points,  with 25 sec- 
onds long blocks, and 4 blocks per condition  (0-back,  2-back);  The Gam-

math and story blocks were maintained  at same length),  and 4 blocks 
per condition  (math, story); The Social task included  274 time-points,  
with 23 seconds  long blocks and 2 or 3 blocks per condition  (run 1 con-

The Emotion  task included  176 time-points,  with 18 seconds  long block

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119138,"2.1. Voxelwise  parameter  estimation  
We evaluated  ﬁve parameter  estimation  methods:  two methods  
(Bayesian  Multi-Tensor  Model-Selection  [BaMM]  and FSL’s BedpostX  
[BPX]) used the ball and sticks model ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ); the third 
crossing  ﬁber method  (Constant  Solid Angle Q-Ball Imaging  [QBI]) used 
spherical  harmonics  ( Aganj et al., 2010 ); and two methods  (Linear  Least 
Squares  [LLS] and Single Tensor Bayesian  [STB]) used the classic single 
tensor model ( Basser et al., 1994a ). 
2.1.1. Bayesian  multi-tensor  model-selection  (BaMM)  modeling  ball and 
sticks 
We adapted  a Bayesian  model selection  algorithm  followed  by pa- 
rameter  estimation  of the winning  model (modiﬁed  from ( Lee et al., 
2010 )). BaMM evaluated  several competing  models derived  from the 
ball and sticks model (aka one ball vs. one ball and one stick; see Eq. (1) ). 
Model selection  and parameter  estimation  used a Markov-Chain  Monte 
Carlo (MCMC),  with Metropolis-Hastings  sampling,  and simulated  an- 
nealing.  The model selection  penalty  was scaled based on the input data 
size. Additional  details on the implementation  of this model are in the 
Supplemental  Material.  
2.1.2. FSL’s BedpostX  (BPX) 
The ball and stick model, developed  by FSL ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ), is 
an alternative  to the single diﬀusion  tensor model ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ; 
Jbabdi et al., 2012 ). BPX is a multi-compartment  model, in which the 
ﬁrst compartment  models the diﬀusion  of free water as isotropic  (ball), 
and the rest of the 𝑘 compartments  model diﬀusion  along several axial 
ﬁber directions  with zero diﬀusion  in the radial direction  (sticks).  The 
predicted  diﬀusion  signal is: 
𝜇𝑖 = 𝑆 0 [(1 − Σ𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 )𝑒𝑥𝑝 (− 𝑏 𝑖 𝑑 )+ Σ𝑘 𝑓 𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (
− 𝑏 𝑖 𝑑 (𝑔 𝑇 
𝑖 𝑥 𝑘 )2 )]
(1) 
where 𝑖 indexes  encoding  direction  and 𝑘 indexes  compartment.  𝑆 0 is 
the signal with no diﬀusion  weighting  and 𝜇𝑖 is the signal with a diﬀu- 
sion gradient  applied  along the unit vector 𝑔 𝑖 with b- value 𝑏 𝑖 on diﬀusion  
signal 𝑑. The 𝑓 𝑘 are volume  fractions  for each ﬁber compartment.  Each 
ﬁber compartment  is modeled  as a stick-like  tensor oriented  along 𝑥 𝑘 . 
We employed  FSL’s BedpostX  6.0.0 to evaluate  BPX ( Sotiropoulos  et al., 
2016 ). The Bayesian  parameter  estimation  approach  uses Automatic  
Relevance  Determination  (ARD) to down weight unnecessary  ﬁbers. 
BPX estimates  angles 𝜃and 𝜙but not FA, MD, AD, or RD. Angles 𝜃and 𝜙
are estimated  for every direction  (indeed  by 𝑘 ). We ran BedpostX  using 
the default settings  unless noted otherwise:  2 ﬁbers, weight = 1, and 
burn in = 1000.

Fig. 1. Estimated  Tensor and Angles 
(A) Constant  Solid Angle Q-Ball Imaging  (QBI) reports ﬁfteen spherical  harmonic  
values, from which a 3D surface is estimated.  The surface is colored by the 
orientation  distribution  function  (ODF). The surface/ODF  peaks are extracted  
(black line) and angles 𝜑 and 𝜃estimated  to match in B. (B) For Linear Least 
Squares (LLS) and Single Tensor Bayesian  (STB), the tensor describing  Brownian  
diﬀusion  of water was calculated.  Three eigenvalues  are used to describe  the 
tensor shape. From the largest eigenvector,  two angles are estimated  to describe  
the tensor orientation  in 3D space. For Bayesian  Multi-Tensor  Model-Selection  
(BaMM)  and FSL’s BedpostX  (BPX), a stick corresponding  to eigenvector-1  is 
estimated  and its angles reported.  
2.1.3. DSI studio’s constant  solid angle Q-Ball imaging  (CSA-QBI)  
Q-ball imaging  is a widely used reconstruction  scheme  available  
through  DSI Studio that estimates  the diﬀusion  orientation  distri- 
bution function  (dODF)  through  a spherical  tomographic  inversion  
( Tuch, 2004 ). QBI was derived  from q-space  formalism  ( Callaghan  et al., 
1988 ) and uses a Funk-Radon  transform  to estimate  the dODF. The orig- 
inal Q-ball imaging  improved  the dODF estimation  by considering  the 
constant  solid angle (CSA-QBI;  ( Aganj et al., 2010 )). CSA-QBI  was down- 
loaded from NITRC (nitrc.org)  in 2020. For ease of comparison  to the 
other methods  (LLS, STB, BPX, BaMM, and CSD), we estimated  the angle 
of the peaks given by the dODF surface generated  by CSA-QBI  ( Fig. 1 A). 
Peaks were selecting  based on a normalized  dODF probability  greater than 0.3 and with a matching  antipodal  peak deﬁned  as two peaks hav- 
ing an absolute  value dot product  greater than 0.99. 
2.1.4. MRtrix3’s  constrained  spherical  deconvolution  (CSD) 
Constrained  spherical  deconvolution  (CSD) is currently  one of 
the most cited reconstruction  schemes  available  through  MRtrix3  
( Tournier  et al., 2007 , 2013 , 2019 ). This method  uses a constrained  
spherical  deconvolution  to estimate  the ﬁber orientation  distribution  
(FOD) and implements  a regularized  spherical  deconvolution  to decon- 
volve the signal with a single ﬁber response  function.  The following  MR- 
trix3 functions  with default settings  were used unless otherwise  noted: 
dwi2response  with default tournier  ﬂag; dwi2fod  with default csd ﬂag; 
sh2peaks  to extract XYZ coordinates  of default top three peaks. For ease 
of comparison  to the other methods  (LLS, STB, BaMM, BPX, and CSA- 
QBI), the second and third peaks were included  as a ﬁber direction  if 
their magnitude  was at least 10% of the maximal  peak. The XYZ coordi- 
nates were then converted  to spherical  polar coordinates  for consistency  
of presentation.  
2.1.5. Linear least squares (LLS) 
The LLS method  solves an overdetermined  system of linear equations  
by single value decomposition  ( Basser et al., 1994a ; Tristán-Vega  et al., 
2012 ). The solution  yields a diﬀusion  tensor 𝐷, which can be decom-  
posed into eigenvalues  ( 𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 , Fig. 1 B) and eigenvectors  ( 𝜈1 , 𝜈2 , 𝜈3 ). 
Derived  quantities  from FSL’s ‘dtiﬁt’ are fractional  anisotropy  (FA), ra- 
dial diﬀusivity  (RD), axial diﬀusivity  (AD), mean diﬀusivity  (MD). In 
addition,  the orientation  of the principal  axis of diﬀusion  can be charac-  
terized in terms of polar angles relative  to the Z-axis ( 𝜃) and azimuthal  
rotation  in the XY plane ( 𝜙, Fig. 1 B ( Behrens  et al., 2003 ). 
2.1.6. Single tensor Bayesian  estimation  (STB) 
We wanted  to compare  the LLS single tensor ﬁt to a Bayesian  esti- 
mation that used biological  priors and had a non-negative  constraint.  
The single tensor Bayesian  method  estimates  the posterior  probability  
of the set of parameters,  𝜔 𝑖 = ( 𝜃, 𝜙, 𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 , 𝑆 0 ) in voxel 𝑗, given the 
single tensor model 𝑀with relevant  background  information  I : 
𝑃 ( 𝜔 𝑖 |𝑀 𝑗 , 𝐼) ∝𝑃 ( 𝑀 𝑗 |𝜔 𝑖 , 𝐼) 𝑃 ( 𝜔 𝑖 |𝐼) (2) 
The background  information  𝐼is given as several priors that reﬂect 
biological  constraints:  𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 were limited to between  0 and 3 mm 2 /s, 
3  N.A. Seider, B. Adeyemo,  R. Miller et al. NeuroImage  254 (2022) 119138 
the biological  range of diﬀusion  in white matter.  We assumed  rotational  
symmetry;  𝜆2 , 𝜆3 were set equal to each other, and 𝜃, 𝜙were limited 
to between  0 and 𝜋owing to the directional  symmetry  of the diﬀusion  
tensor. In STB, diﬀusion  is modeled  as a tensor, 𝑀 ( see Eq. (3) below).  To 
estimate  the model parameters,  we used standard  Monte Carlo Markov  
Chain methods  ( Lee et al., 2010 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12573, 12578), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(9258, 9264), match='\n2.2. '>"

2.6. Time-frequency  analysis  of EEG 
Our central research  question  on the sensorimotor  beta rhythm  was 
addressed  by ﬁrst estimating  the magnitude  of beta (15–30 Hz) power 
from the EEG channel  C3 in the left hemisphere  (contralateral  to the 
right hand used for response)  (see Fig. 3 A for channel  location).  C3 
has been widely used to study the sensorimotor  beta rhythm  from the 
primary  motor cortex ( Deiber et al., 2012 ; Gonzalez-Rosa  et al., 2015 ; 
Jackson  et al., 2019 ; López-Larraz  et al., 2015 ; Picazio  et al., 2014 ; 
Swann et al., 2015 ). The oscillatory  power of neural signal was cal- 
culated  by means of Fast Fourier  Transformation  (FFT) using the new- 
timef function  in EEGLAB.  This procedure  implements  the calculation  of 
changes  in oscillatory  power by means of a moving  window  (steps = 10 
msec). The mean event-related  (log) spectral  perturbation  (ERSP) was 
computed  with respect to the preceding  800 ms before the decision  cue. 
After the FFT, the epochs covered  from − 544 ms to 2439 ms around 
the decision  cue onset. 1 The ERSPs were averaged  across the beta fre- 
quency  range (15–30 Hz). Sensorimotor  beta rhythm  during the evalu- 
ation phase was identiﬁed  based on testing the presence  of the event- 
related desynchronization  (ERD) by comparing  the ERSP against  zero as 
described  in the Results section.  
2.7. ERP analysis  
In addition  to estimating  the sensorimotor  beta oscillations,  we es- 
timated  the ERPs in order to understand  the relative  timing of the sen- 
sorimotor  beta rhythm  within the temporal  cascade  of the decision  pro- 
cess. In particular,  we analyzed  the P2 and P3 components  involved  
in the processing  of reward-related  cues ( Glazer et al., 2018 ). The ERPs 
were identiﬁed  in the channels  of interest  (COI) reported  in our previous  
1 The epoch length prior to ﬀt was set to − 800 to 3200 ms around the deci- 
sion cue onset which included  the [ − 800 0] ms as a baseline,  [0 1500] ms as 
the duration  of decision  cue, and the ﬁrst 1700 ms of the subsequent  ﬁxation 
screen. This long epoch including  the post-cue  ﬁxation period was set expecting  
that after ﬀt, the interval will become shorter, cutting oﬀthe boundaries  of the 
decision  cue phase. After ﬀt, the epoch interval became − 544 ms to 2439 ms.

and P3 in similar decision-making  paradigms  ( Chen et al., 2019 , 2020 ; 
San Martin et al. 2013 , 2016 ). A frontocentral  COI consisted  of ﬁve 
electrodes  centered  on the standard  FCz channel  (Fz, FCz, Cz, FC1, FC2) 
and a parietocentral  COI consisted  of four electrodes  centered  on the 
standard  Pz channel  (Pz, POz, CP1, CP2) (Fig. S2). Average  amplitudes  
over these electrodes  were entered  in subsequent  statistical  analyses,  
with time windows  selected  according  to previous  studies ( Polich 2007 ; 
Potts et al., 1996 ) and by visual inspection  of the waveforms  in our data. 
All ERP results are reported  in the Supplementary  Materials.  
2.8. fMRI data analysis  
In our fMRI analysis  we primarily  focused  on determining  the co- 
variation  between  sensorimotor  beta and the BOLD responses  associ- 
ated the evaluation  phase, during which participants  were processing  
the reward and Go-probability  information.  Prior to testing for the co- 
variations,  we also investigated  the task-related  BOLD activations  in the 
evaluation  and action phase (standard  MRI analysis)  to replicate  prior 
studies of decision  making  within our newly developed  experimental  
paradigm  and conﬁrm  that it is well suited for the purpose  of our study. 
To this end, a GLM was constructed  including  the following  regressors.  
First, to look at brain activations  associated  with experimental  variables  
in the evaluation  phase and the action phase, we modeled  the onset of 
the decision  cues and Go/NoGo  stimulus  with a duration  of 0 s as the 
main regressors  of interest.  Only correct Go/NoGo  trials were included  
as main regressors  for action phase. Three parametric  regressors  were 
added to the decision  cue regressor  to account  for the main eﬀect of re- 
ward (large vs. small reward:  [1, − 1]), main eﬀect of Go-probability  
(75% vs. 50% vs. 25%: [1, 0, − 1]) and the interaction  between  the 
two factors (large_75%,  small_75%,  large_50%,  small_50%,  large_25%,  
small_25%:  [1, − 1, 0, 0, − 1, 1]). Next, to look at the covariation  between  
sensorimotor  beta and BOLD responses  associated  with the evaluation  
phase, we added the normalized  single-trial  beta power as a paramet-  
ric modulator  to the decision  cue regressor.  Additionally,  the following  
were included  as regressors  of no interest:  onset of feedback  with the 
magnitude  of reward points earned added as a parametric  regressor,  
onset of Go/NoGo  stimulus  with incorrect  responses,  and six head mo- 
tion parameters.  In order to account  for spurious  motion artifacts,  each 
frame displacement  greater than 0.5 mm was also coded as a covariate  
of no interest  in the GLM. 
Due to the complexity  of our GLM and the fact that our key regressors  
of interest  —i.e., decision  cue and Go/NoGo  stimulus  regressors  —were  
not always temporally  spaced out enough  despite jittering  of ISIs, we 
checked  for the multicollinearity  across the key regressors  2 by calculat-  
ing the variance  inﬂation  factor (VIF). The mean VIF across all subject 
was 1.41, which was close to 1 suggesting  ‘ no collinearity  ’ and much 
below 4 suggesting  ‘requiring  further investigation’  ( Akinwande  et al., 
2015 ; Craney and Surles 2002 ). 
Analyses  of fMRI data were conducted  in predetermined  regions-of-  
interest  (ROIs) based on our a priori hypotheses.  For anatomical  struc- 
tures that are relatively  large and well identiﬁed,  such as the cortical  
motor regions,  thalamus,  caudate  and putamen,  we used anatomical  
masks adapted  from standardized  templates  including  the Human  Mo- 
tor Area Template  (HMAT)  ( Mayka et al., 2006 ), WFU PickAtlas  toolbox  
( Maldjian  et al., 2003 ), and the Basal Ganglia  Human  Area Template  
(BGHAT)  ( Prodoehl  et al., 2008 ). In these anatomical  masks, the ef- 
fects of experimental  variables  and the covariation  with the sensorimo-  
tor beta oscillations  were assessed  using small volume  correction  with 
a peak voxel-level  p FWE-corr  < 0.05. For smaller  basal ganglia  struc- 
tures and functional  ROIs that we deﬁned  based on the literature,  we 
2 The key regressors  included  in testing for multicollinearity  were the deci- 
sion cue regressor,  its parametric  modulation  by sensorimotor  beta, and the 
correct/incorrect  Go/NoGo  stimulus  regressors.  created  spherical  ROIs centered  on the corresponding  MNI coordinates.  
The eﬀects of experimental  variables  and the covariation  with the senso- 
rimotor  beta oscillations  were summarized  by taking the average  of the 
eﬀect across all voxels within each spherical  ROI. The list of spherical  
ROIs, the MNI coordinates  and their relative  sizes in radius as wells as 
each of the references  from which the coordinates  were taken are listed 
in Table 1 . The sizes of the spherical  ROIs were adjusted  based on the 
respective  size of the structure.  Results from analyses  using the spherical  
ROIs are reported  after Bonferroni  correction.  
2.8.1. Task-related  BOLD activations  
We tested for the brain activations  associated  with encoding  of de- 
cision variables  (i.e., reward and Go-probability  information)  during 
evaluation  phase by testing for the three parametric  regressors  in pre- 
deﬁned  spherical  ROIs of the valuation  network  —the VS, vmPFC,  and 
VTA —adopted  from previous  studies ( Bartra et al., 2013 ; Murty et al., 
2014 ) (see Table 1 ). We also examined  task-related  activations  during 
the action phase, speciﬁcally  those associated  with Go vs. NoGo re- 
sponse.  Considering  that our Value-Based  Go-NoGo  task was not compa-  
rable to the traditional  Go-NoGo  paradigms  and that there was no spe- 
ciﬁc hypothesis  about the action phase, we performed  an exploratory  
whole-brain  analyses  in the contrast  between  Go vs. NoGo trials. These 
results are presented  in Supplementary  Materials.  
2.8.2. Covariation  between  the sensorimotor  beta oscillations  and the 
BOLD response  associated  with evaluation  phase 
The central aim of this study was to determine  the neural circuitries  
associated  with the sensorimotor  beta signal during the evaluation  
phase. Speciﬁcally,  we tested if the beta signal is associated  with the 
cortical  motor regions,  subcortical  basal ganglia  and thalamic  nuclei, 
or the valuation  network.  To this end, we ﬁrst tested for the eﬀect of 
the beta-power  modulation  within the anatomical  masks of the cortical  
motor regions  (HMAT),  thalamus  (extracted  from WFU PickAtlas  tool- 
box) and caudate/putamen  (BGHAT).  HMAT included  sub-regions  of the 
cortical  motor system including  the pre-supplementary  (pre-SMA)  and 
supplementary  motor (SMA) area, the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) 
premotor  cortex and, the primary  motor cortex (M1). For smaller  basal 
ganglia  nuclei (i.e., GPi, GPe, STN, SN), beta-power  modulation  was 
tested within the corresponding  spherical  ROIs ( Table 1 ). We then tested 
for the eﬀect of beta-power  modulation  in the valuation  network  (i.e., 
VS, vmPFC,  and VTA), using the same ROIs from the analysis  of task- 
related BOLD activations.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(25081, 25100), match=' Data availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(10361, 10367), match='  \n3. '>"

4. Results  
4.1. AQP1-encoding  rAAV vector causes DWI contrast  changes  in vitro 
and in vivo 
To examine  whether  the AQP1-encoding  rAAV vector can infect cells 
and function  as a DWI reporter,  we ﬁrst conducted  the in vitro study in 
the BHK21 cells. The cells were transfected  with each rAAV transfer  
plasmid  (P1, P2, or P3) ( Fig. 1 A) and collected  for MRI scanning.  The 
MRI results showed  that DWI signal intensities  in the cells expressing  ei- 
ther AQP1-EGFP  or AQP1 decreased  compared  to those expressing  EGFP 
alone or the mock control (Sham)  ( Fig. 1 B) . Consistently,  the ADC of 
AQP1-expressing  cells signiﬁcantly  increased  compared  to the control 
cells ( Fig. 1 C–D) , suggesting  that the rAAV vectors  encoding  the AQP1 
could be used as a DWI reporter.  
We next investigated  whether  the rAAV encoding  AQP1 could be 
visualized  by the in vivo DWI. The rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  or rAAV-EGFP  that 
allow local expression  of the exogenous  gene at the initial infection  site 
were stereotactically  injected  into the bilateral  CPU regions  in the mouse 
brain ( Fig. 2 A, n = 4). After 21 days’ infection,  the living mouse brain 
was imaged  using the MRI scanner.  The brain region injected  with the 
rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  represented  a strong DWI contrast  and higher ADC 
value than those at the contralateral  region ( Fig. 2 A, B ). The expression  
of AQP1-EGFP  and EGFP in the bilateral  CPU regions  was conﬁrmed  by 
immunohistochemistry  staining  and ﬂuorescent  imaging  of brain slices 
( Fig. 2 C ). The haematoxylin-eosin  staining  result revealed  that there 
was no edema or necrosis  in either the AQP1-EGFP  or EGFP expressing  
brain regions  ( Fig. S1 ), which is consistent  with ﬁndings  of a previous  
report ( Mukherjee  et al., 2016 ). 
To examine  the eﬀect of AQP1-encoding  rAAV on the neuronal  func- 
tions, the patch experiments  were conducted  in mice infected  with the 
rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  and rAAV-EGFP  in bilateral  CPU regions.  The results 
showed  no signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  in the fundamental  electrical  charac-  
teristics  between  the neurons  infected  with the rAAV-AQP1-EGFP  and 
rAAV-EGFP  ( Fig. S2 ). 4.2. Detection  of the neural connections  using in vivo DWI 
To detect the neural connection  of the whole brain in living ani- 
mals, the retrograde  AAV vectors  (rAAV2-retro)  were utilized  to trace 
the upstream  brain regions  of the injected  site. Five mice were included  
in each group. The rAAV2-retro  expressing  AQP1-EGFP  (rAAV-retro-  
AQP1-EGFP)  or EGFP alone (rAAV-retro-EGFP)  were constructed  and 
micro-injected  into the CPU region. 21 days after infection,  the living 
mouse brain was imaged  using the in vivo DWI method.  The patterns  of 
the GFP signals in both groups were similar,  suggesting  that the diﬀer- 
ent rAAV2-retro  vectors  retrograde  to the same brain regions  ( Fig. 3 ). 
No discernable  hypointensity  MRI contrast  was observed  in the brain 
infected  with rAAV-retro-EGFP  ( Fig. 4 A ). However,  the DWI images of 
the rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  group exhibited  a signiﬁcant  change in in- 
tensity ( Fig. 4 B ). Hypointensity  DWI contrast  could be found in multiple  
brain regions,  including  the injection  site of the right CPU, Ctx (cere- 
bral cortex),  BLA (basolateral  amygdala),  Ins (insular  cortex),  right Tha 
(thalamus),  right HIP (hippocampus).  The ADC map of all mice in the 
rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  and the rAAV-retro-EGFP  groups were calcu- 
lated and compared.  The ADC values of several regions  in the rAAV- 
retro-AQP1-EGFP  group were higher than the rAAV-retro-EGFP  group 
( Fig. 4 C ) and overlapped  with the regions  that showed  hypointensity  
DWI signals ( Fig. 4 B ). The presence  of AQP1 expression  in brain regions  
of the rAAV-retro-AQP1-EGFP  group was observed  using immunohisto-  
chemistry  staining  ( Fig. 4 D ). To illustrate  the correlation  between  the 
results of MRI and immunohistochemistry  in the structural  brain regions  
or sub-regions,  the mouse brain atlas (Paxinos  and Franklin)  was su- 
perimposed  with the images ( Fig. S3 ). Although  the resolution  of the 
DWI-MRI  was much lower than the ﬂuorescence  imaging,  the AQP1 ex- 
pression  and AQP1-based  MRI contrasts  could be detected  in the same 
locations.  Extensive  overlap  areas of the DWI-MRI  contrast  and AQP1 
expression  signals ( Figs. 4 B–D and S3 ) were also found, suggesting  pro- 
nounced  activity  of the AQP1 as a DWI-MRI  reporter.  These tracing re- 
sults are consistent  with the reported  anatomical  connectivity  of the CPU 
( Davidsson  et al., 2019 ; Tervo et al., 2016 ). 
To further validate  the MRI-based  in vivo neural connections  tracing 
method,  the rAAV2-retro-AQP1-EGFP  was injected  into the VTA region 
that receives  abundant  input from the cerebral  cortex. As found in the 
CPU region ( Fig. 4 ), the neural connections  of VTA were also success-  
fully visualized  by both MRI and ﬂuorescence  imaging  approaches  ( Fig. 
S4 ). 
To this end, we have successfully  established  the rAAV2-retro-AQP1-  
EGFP that is able to eﬀectively  express  the AQP1 and trace the neural 
connections  visualized  by both the in vivo DWI and ﬂuorescent  imaging.

work as our microstate  pipeline  so that brain-state  dynamics  using dif- 
ferent methodologies  can be directly  compared  and contrasted.  Further-  
more, +microstate  includes  functions  for hypothesis  testing that mi- 
crostates  are associated  with distinct  patterns  of cortical  connectivity  
( Hatz et al., 2015; 2016; Tait and Zhang, 2022 ), as well as perform  
simulations  of data from ground  truth microstate  sequences  ( Tait and 
Zhang, 2022 ), which is useful for assessing  clustering  methodologies  
against  a ground  truth ( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). Novel advanced  statis- 
tical techniques  for task-based  analysis  are additionally  included  in the toolbox,  including  cluster-permutation  ( Maris and Oostenveld,  2007 ) 
extensions  to topographic  ANOVAs  (TANOVAs)  ( Murray  et al., 2008 ) 
and 𝜒2 statistics  of microstate  probabilities  in response  to stimuli 
( Tait and Zhang, 2022 ). +microstate  is based around objects which 
store the data and have intuitively  named functions  for analysis,  simu- 
lation, visualization,  and statistics,  resulting  in a simple,  accessible  tool- 
box for microstate  analysis  with limited coding background  required.  
This manuscript  is structured  as follows.  In Section  2 , we out- 
line the requirements,  implementation  and usage of +microstate,  in- 
cluding  key commands  and how data is stored. In Section  3 , we 
present  examples  which demonstrate  validity  of the toolbox  with em- 
pirical/simulated  sensor/source-space  M/EEG  data, with a focus on 
benchmarking  against  ground  truths. This includes  analysis  of resting-  
state EEG to reproduce  the well established  canonical  EEG microstates  
( Michel and Koenig,  2018 ), analysis  of MEG event related ﬁelds (ERFs) 
to uncover  a sensor-MEG  microstate  associated  with diﬀerent  levels of 
activation  under diﬀerent  experimental  conditions,  analysis  of source-  
space MEG microstate  sequences  in response  to auditory  stimuli,  and 
reproducing  ground  truth source-space  microstate  maps and microstate  
statistics  in a simulated  experiment.  Codes and data for these analyses  
are freely available  and included  in +microstate  as MATLAB  Live Script 
tutorials,  and the ﬁgures reported  here were produced  using MATLAB’s  
default random  number  generator  seed to increase  transparency  and 
reproducibility.  Therefore  the examples  presented  here may act as val- 
idation of the toolbox,  examples  of possible  use cases of the toolboxes,  
and as a tutorial.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119528,"Data availability  and quality 
There are three dimensions  regarding  training  data that need to be 
considered:  size, diversity  , and accuracy  . Although  a few techniques  can 
be applied  to reduce the required  amount  of data for training,  a decent 
sample size is necessary  to tune the network  parameters  for a speciﬁc  
task, and to avoid overﬁtting  issues. However,  including  inaccurately  
labelled  data will compromise  the model performance.  Due to the low 
prevalence  of some CSVD lesions in the general  population,  including  
MRI data acquired  from patients  in clinical  settings  can help increase  the 
size of data for training  and validation.  However,  clinical  MRI data are 
usually  limited by the short acquisition  time and therefore  low spatial 
resolution.  CMB, PVS and lacunes  are small lesions,  usually  with diame- 
ters less than 5 mm. Clinical  MRI scans with thick slices (3–5 mm) may 
miss some lesions due to the signiﬁcant  partial volume  eﬀects. In the 
case of PVS, since the number  of PVS is usually  large in the brain, studies 
usually  examine  representative  regions  (e.g., centrum  semiovale,  basal 
ganglia).  A slightly  thicker slice may be acceptable  in such cases if at 
least one slice is acquired  on the desired  region. The location  of the ac- 
quired image slice should be as consistent  as possible  across individuals  
through  locating  landmarks  (e.g., anterior  and posterior  commissure).  
Having  said that, overly thick slices will aﬀect the richness  of contex-  
tual information  from nearby brain regions  which is sometimes  used in 
identifying  PVS. A general  recommendation  of slice thickness  ≤ 3 mm 
would be safe for extracting  CMB, PVS and lacunes  from clinical  scans. 
In addition,  a large number  of similar cases contribute  less than a good 
variety of data. The diversity  of data can come from diﬀerent  sample 
types (healthy  vs. various  diseases)  and scanners/scanning  parameters.  
Studies  using more than one scanner/cohort  for development,  validation  
and testing have been summarized  in Supplementary  Text 1.

On most occasions,  these three factors (size, accuracy,  diversity)  can- 
not be all satisﬁed.  Labelling  small lesions,  like CMB, PVS and lacunes,  
at the voxel level is time-consuming  and subjective.  Usually,  multiple  
raters are assigned  with the same set of data for labelling.  Results are 
then compared,  and for inconsistent  labels, a consensus  is reached  by the 
majority  vote, or being checked  by a more experienced  clinician.  As a 
result, individual  studies are unlikely  to obtain suﬃcient  high-accuracy  
voxel-level  labels for training.  Collaborations  are a promising  approach  
in this regard, as pooling  small data samples  with labels increases  both 
the size and diversity  of data. Public resources  identiﬁed  during the sys- 
temic review have been summarised  in Table 5 . Available  studies have 
applied  data augmentation  with basic translations,  rotations  and mir- 
roring to generate  more data ( Rashid et al., 2021 ). Introducing  artefacts  
such as bias ﬁeld and noise to the images may be helpful for the model 
to generalise  to diﬀerent  samples/scanners  ( Billot et al., 2020 ). In addi- 
tion, techniques  such as uncertainty  modelling  ( Karimi et al., 2020 ) and 
domain  adaption  ( Guan and Liu, 2022 ) can be incorporated  to address  
the issues due to inaccurate  or subjective  labels and excessive  data het- 
erogeneity  due to the data acquisition  process.  Such methods  have been 
developed  for biomedical  image analysis  in general,  but not particularly  
for the domain  of CSVD lesions.  
The MRI modalities  to input into models are also worth considering  
carefully.  Although  there have been consensus  MRI modalities  for each 
CSVD lesion, a small number  of studies included  additional  modalities  
(e.g., QSM ( Rashid et al., 2021 ) and PD ( Ghafaryasl  et al., 2012 )), that 
are not commonly  available,  to improve  the performance.  This may not 
be optimal  when considering  the generalisability  of the model. Some 
techniques,  such as knowledge  distillation  ( Guan et al., 2021 ), could be 
considered  to resolve this issue.

5. Results  
5.1. Diaschisis  eﬀects 
We analyzed  fMRI language  activation  (i.e. Sp > Rev) with respect 
to normative  functional  connectivity  to the individual  lesion site, be- 
cause diaschisis  eﬀects per deﬁnition  must depend  on connectivity  to 
the lesion. 
Language  activation  in regions  with high and low connectivity  to the 
individual  stroke lesion was extracted  at all three points in time (acute, 
subacute  and chronic)  separately  (see Fig. 4 A and Supplementary  Ta- 
ble 3). To highlight  deviations  from normal  activation  patterns,  mean 
language  activation  from healthy  controls  was subtracted  from patient’s  
activation.  This means, that the dashed baselines  at zero in Fig. 4 corre- 
spond to normal  levels of language  activation  as seen in healthy  controls  
while values below that line correspond  to underactivation  in patients  
compared  to controls.  Looking  at Fig. 4 A, we saw activation  mostly be- 
low the level of controls  in both conditions  at all points in time. Ad- 
ditionally,  activation  was signiﬁcantly  lower in regions  with high than 
low normative  connectivity  to the lesion at the acute time point (paired  
t -test, T = 2.3, p = 0.01) corresponding  to a possible  diaschisis  eﬀect.

Fig. 4. Functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  activation  of 44 patients  with aphasia.  
Panel A displays longitudinal  (acute, subacute,  chronic) fMRI language  activation  (speech > reversed speech) in regions with high (red) and low (blue) lesion connectivity.  
Eﬀect sizes of healthy controls have been subtracted  to speciﬁcally  examine stroke induced eﬀects. The dashed line at zero therefore  represents  normal activity levels as observed  
in healthy controls while values below that line indicate underactivation.  Panel B visualizes  the rmANOVA  results and shows both factors and their interaction.  Results from 
F-tests are shown in parenthesis  (n.s. = not signiﬁcant).  Signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  after Bonferroni  correction  in the post-hoc t-tests are indicated  by stars ( ∗ p < 0.05, ∗ ∗ p < 0.001, 
one-tailed).  In both panels, all presented  values are mean scaled beta estimates  extracted  from the fMRI ﬁrst level analysis (arbitrary  units). For display purposes,  all data was 
residualized  for the subject factor to account for the within-subject  design. Central marks of the box represent  the median value, the edges are the 25th and 75th percentiles,  
and the whiskers  extend to the most extreme data points not more than 150% of the interquartile  range beyond the boxes. Filled circles represent  individual  data points. 
In line with our hypothesis,  underactivation  seemed  to be most pro- 
nounced  at the acute time point in regions  with high normative  con- 
nectivity  and to return to normal  over time, compatible  with the phe- 
nomenon  of resolution  of diaschisis.  To statistically  test our hypothesis,  
we performed  a 2 ×3 repeated  measures  ANOVA  with the factors lesion 
connectivity  (high, low) and time (acute, subacute,  chronic)  based on 44 
complete  longitudinal  data sets. Both factors and the interaction  ‘time x 
lesion connectivity’  satisﬁed  the assumption  of sphericity  according  to 
the Mauchly-test  ( p > 0.05). Post-hoc  Bonferroni-corrected  t-tests were 
performed  when a factor or interaction  explained  a signiﬁcant  fraction  
of variance.  The results are displayed  in Fig. 4 B and Table 1 . We found that the factor ‘time’ explained  a signiﬁcant  amount  of 
variance  ( Fig. 4 B, middle panel). Bonferroni  corrected  post-hoc  t-tests 
showed  a signiﬁcant  increase  in language  activation  from the acute to 
the subacute  and from the acute to the chronic  measurement.  This in- 
crease might be partially  caused by reperfusion  of the ischemic  penum-  
bra. Our main research  question,  however,  was whether  increase  in ac- 
tivation  depends  on connectivity  to the lesion. Although  there was no 
eﬀect of lesion connectivity  per se ( Fig. 4 B left panel), the interaction  
‘time x lesion connectivity’  explained  a signiﬁcant  amount  of variance  
( Fig. 4 B right panel). This demonstrates  that temporal  dynamics  in lan- 
guage speciﬁc  activation  indeed depend  on lesion connectivity.  Bon-

Panel A displays  the predeﬁned  mask (red) of candidate  regions aﬀected  by potential  diaschisis  eﬀects on the group level deﬁned by signiﬁcantly  less activation  
of patients  at any point in time compared  to healthy controls  (conjunction  null of two-sample  t-tests, p(FWE) < 0.05 at the cluster-level,  cluster forming  threshold

this distribution  between  regions with high and low lesion connectivity  (random  permutation  test with 5000 permutations,  p(FWE) < 0.05 on the voxel-level).  The 
contrast  high > low is shown in warm and the opposite  contrast  in cool colors. Numbers  refer to absolute  diﬀerence  in occurrence  of the labels high and low lesion

ferroni corrected  post-hoc  t-tests demonstrated  a signiﬁcantly  steeper  
increase  in language  speciﬁc  fMRI activation  in regions  with high than 
in regions  with low lesion connectivity  from the acute to the subacute  
phase. This could be explained  by a distinct  diaschisis  eﬀect in regions  
with high lesion connectivity  in the acute phase, which (at least par- 
tially) resolves  from the acute to the subacute  phase. Of note, the sub- 
traction  of language  activation  of healthy  controls  (measured  once) from 
language  activation  of patients  (measured  longitudinally)  does not in- 
ﬂuence  the results of all statistical  tests performed  longitudinally.  
We were also interested  in the spatial  distribution  of the regions  
with high and low lesion connectivity  in all 71 patients  ( Fig. 5 B and 5 C) 
within the predeﬁned  mask ( Fig. 5 A) and indeed found speciﬁc  diﬀer- 
ences ( Fig. 5 D). Regions  with high lesion connectivity  (where we would 
expect diaschisis  eﬀects)  were located  signiﬁcantly  more frequently  in 
left frontotemporal  cortical  areas, especially  in the inferior  frontal gyrus 
(pars triangularis  and opercularis),  and the middle temporal  gyrus, es- 
pecially  in the posterior  portion.  Regions  with low lesion connectivity  
were more frequently  found in the left inferior  temporal  and fusiform  
gyri. 
5.2. Correlation  with behavioral  data 
To test for behavioral  relevance  of the described  eﬀects on fMRI ac- 
tivation,  we performed  correlation  analyses  between  diﬀerential  fMRI 
eﬀect sizes and global severity  of aphasia.  Since we were particularly  
interested  in the interaction  ‘time x lesion connectivity’,  we performed  
linear (i.e. Pearson)  correlation  analyses  between  the eﬀect of ‘lesion 
connectivity’  (diﬀerence  of mean fMRI activation  in regions  with high 
and low –i.e. high minus low –connectivity  to the lesion) with the lan- 
guage recovery  score (LRS) for each point in time separately  (see ﬁrst 
three columns  of Table 2 ). 
We found a signiﬁcant  correlation  between  LRS and lesion 
connectivity-dependent  language  activation  at the subacute  measure-  
ment ( n = 67, p = 0.003, signiﬁcant  after Bonferroni  correction,  see 
Fig. 6 A). Better language  performance  (in terms of LRS values)  was as- 
sociated  with higher language  activation  in regions  with high compared  
to low lesion connectivity.  We argue that low values in this contrast  re- ﬂect a diaschisis  eﬀect because  they denote less language  activation  in 
regions  with high lesion connectivity  compared  to regions  with low le- 
sion connectivity.  Therefore,  the described  positive  correlation  indicates  
that less diaschisis  (or more resolution  of diaschisis)  at the subacute  
measurement  is related to better language  performance.  
As our conclusions  are mainly based on longitudinal  changes  in fMRI 
activation,  we additionally  performed  correlation  analyses  between  lon- 
gitudinal  changes  of fMRI eﬀect sizes and LRS (see last three columns  of 
Table 2 ). Here, we found a signiﬁcant  association  between  resolution  of 
the language  speciﬁc  diaschisis  eﬀect (i.e. Δhigh > low) and behavioral  
improvement  ( ΔLRS) from the subacute  to the chronic  measurement  
( n = 50, p = 0.003, signiﬁcant  after Bonferroni  correction,  see Fig. 6 B). 
6. Discussion  
This is the ﬁrst study examining  functional  diaschisis  eﬀects and 
their functional  relevance  in patients  with acute aphasia  due to ischemic  
stroke by combining  lesion network  mapping  with longitudinal  task- 
based fMRI. Our hypothesis  was that resolution  of lesion-distant  neural 
dysfunction  (diaschisis),  operationalized  by increasing  language  speciﬁc  
fMRI activation,  would be located  predominantly  in regions  with high 
normative  connectivity  to the lesion site as assessed  with resting-state  
fMRI data from healthy  participants.  In accordance  with our hypothesis,  
we found a signiﬁcantly  steeper  increase  of language  speciﬁc  activation  
from the acute to the subacute  measurement  in regions  with high than 
in regions  with low lesion connectivity.  We interpret  this increase  in 
activation  as resolution  of the diaschisis  eﬀect in functional  networks  
aﬀected  by the lesion. The behavioral  relevance  of this eﬀect is shown 
by a signiﬁcant  correlation  between  global language  scores and the size 
of the diaschisis  eﬀect at the subacute  measurement.  Speciﬁcally,  higher 
language  speciﬁc  activation  in regions  with high compared  to low lesion 
connectivity  was associated  with better global language  performance.  
The link between  diaschisis  and the language  deﬁcit in the early phase 
post stroke is particularly  plausible  given the spatial distribution  of re- 
gions with high compared  to those with low lesion connectivity  ( Fig. 5 D) 
which closely resembled  core language  regions  in the inferior  frontal 
gyrus and the middle temporal  gyrus mostly pronounced  in its posterior

Pearson correlation  analyses  between  lesion connectivity  speciﬁc language  activation  (i.e. high 
> low) and language  recovery  score were calculated  for each measurement  (acute, subacute,  
chronic)  and for longitudinal  changes  between  the measurements  (acute-subacute,  subacute-  
chronic,  acute-chronic)  using all available  data. Positive r-values  indicate  that higher language  
activation  in regions with high compared  to low lesion connectivity  (i.e. less diaschisis)  corre- 
lates with better language  performance  or that resolution  of diaschisis  correlates  with behavioral  
improvement,  respectively.  Reported  p-values  are uncorrected.  Asterisks  indicate  signiﬁcant

(A) In the subacute  measurement,  there was a signiﬁcant  correlation  between a language  speciﬁc diaschisis  eﬀect ( i.e. high > low lesion connectivity)  and language  recovery  
score. The positive association  means that less diaschisis  correlates  with better language  performance.  (B) Improvements  in these two measures  from the subacute  to the chronic 
phase were also signiﬁcantly  correlated.  Solid lines represent  best linear ﬁt with its 95% conﬁdence  interval (dashed lines). Circles are individual  data points. Abbreviations:

portion  ( Binder et al., 2009 ; Noonan  et al., 2013 ; Rodd et al., 2015 ). 
Our data suggest  that language  deﬁcits  in the early phase after stroke 
are partially  caused by functional  diaschisis  eﬀects in frontotemporal  
core areas for language  processing.  This means that regions  previously  
functionally  connected  to the lesion site become  dysfunctional  because  
of the missing  input from the lesion site. In turn, this leads to less lan- 
guage speciﬁc  activation  in these regions.  
Importantly,  while previous  studies on diaschisis  in aphasic  patients  
focused  solely on subcortical  lesions ( Boes et al., 2015 ; Hillis et al., 2002 ; 
Vallar et al., 1988 ; Weiller  et al., 1993 ), we here provide  evidence  for 
diaschisis  in functional  networks  mostly aﬀected  by cortical  infarcts.  
Furthermore,  improvement  of aphasia  might be partially  caused by res- 
olution  of functional  diaschisis.  Indeed,  the corresponding  correlation  
analysis  of longitudinal  behavioral  changes  and longitudinal  changes  
in diﬀerential  fMRI activation  demonstrated  a signiﬁcant  association  of 
behavioral  recovery  and resolution  of the functional  diaschisis  eﬀect, 
which, however,  was found from the subacute  to the chronic  phase. 
Nevertheless,  our behavioral  data ( Fig. 3 ) conﬁrmed  the previously  de- 
scribed  pattern  of highly dynamic  language  recovery  in the early phase 
which then decelerates  over time ( Pedersen  et al., 1995 ). We therefore  
interpret  our data in the sense that the early behavioral  improvement  
seen in many aphasic  patients  might be caused by resolution  of diaschi-  
sis to a signiﬁcant  degree.  This is in line with previous  studies that show that resolution  of diaschisis  occurs mainly within the ﬁrst days to weeks 
after stroke onset ( Carrera  and Tononi,  2014 ; Witte et al., 2000 ). 
In the study of diaschisis,  the added value of combining  task-based  
fMRI and lesion network  mapping  is of particular  importance.  In pre- 
vious studies,  task-based  fMRI in acute aphasic  stroke patients  showed  
an acute decrease  in language  speciﬁc  activation  in both hemispheres  
which then resolved  over time as a possible  correlate  of diaschisis  
( Saur et al., 2006 ; Stockert  et al., 2020 ). Using this method  in isola- 
tion, however,  it remained  unclear  whether  the longitudinal  dynamics  
in activation  (or which part of it) depends  on connectivity  to the lesion 
as one would expect in diaschisis.  On the other hand, studies solely us- 
ing lesion network  mapping  demonstrated  a relationship  between  nor- 
mative lesion connectivity  to Broca’s  area and aphasia  in patients  with 
subcortical  lesions ( Boes et al., 2015 ). Yet, in this study it remained  un- 
clear whether  a dysfunction  in Broca’s  area indeed caused the aphasia.  
Alternatively,  involvement  of the lesioned  subcortical  areas (all func- 
tionally  connected  to Broca’s  area) in language  processing  could have 
led to aphasia.  The combination  of both methods,  as implemented  in 
our study, allows demonstrating  an acute decrease  in activation  which 
then partially  resolves  over time. This resolution  is signiﬁcantly  more 
pronounced  in regions  with functional  connections  to the lesion. In our 
opinion,  this operationalization  of the diaschisis  eﬀect and its resolution  
is the closest one described  in the literature  so far.

Alternative  mechanisms  contributing  to early post-stroke  fMRI acti- 
vation changes  include  hypo- and reperfusion  of the ischemic  penumbra  
( Hillis et al., 2008 ; Hossmann,  1994 ). The current  analysis  used existing  
data from research  projects  that primarily  aimed at characterizing  lan- 
guage recovery  after aphasic  stroke with no speciﬁc  focus on diaschisis.  
Therefore,  no perfusion  measurements  were performed.  We argue, that 
eﬀects of reperfusion  are represented  by the main eﬀect of ‘time’ with 
an increase  of language  activity  mainly from the acute to the subacute  
time point while the interaction  ‘time x lesion connectivity’  speciﬁcally  
demonstrates  an additional  lesion connectivity  dependent  increase  in 
language  activity  representing  resolution  of diaschisis.  This is based on 
the assumption  that the dependency  of dynamics  in fMRI activation  on 
normative  lesion connectivity  (represented  by the interaction  ‘time x le- 
sion connectivity’)  cannot be explained  by vascular  eﬀects because  func- 
tional networks  are independent  of vascular  territories  ( Beckmann  et al., 
2005 ). It should be noted though,  that regions  with high lesion connec-  
tivity tended to belong to the territory  of the middle cerebral  artery 
while regions  with low lesion connectivity  more frequently  belonged  to 
the vertebrobasilar  territory  (see Fig. 5 D). To address  this limitation,  
we repeated  the original  analysis  with a small modiﬁcation.  We used 
distance  maps instead  of lesion network  maps to deﬁne regions  near to 
the lesion (i.e. in the ischemic  penumbra)  and remote from the lesion 
(i.e. outside  the ischemic  penumbra).  Each distance  map encodes  the 
(shortest)  distance  to the individual  stroke lesion (see Supplementary  
Information  for methodological  details).  We would expect reperfusion  
eﬀects mainly in regions  near to the lesion and not or to a lesser extent 
in regions  remote from the lesion. The overall results were comparable  
to the original  analysis  (cf. Table 1 ). However,  the interaction  ‘time x 
proximity’  did not reach signiﬁcance.  Therefore,  subacute  reactivation  
was the same in regions  near to the lesion (i.e. ischemic  penumbra)  and 
remote from the lesion. Additionally,  none of the correlation  analyses  
(analogous  to Table 2 ) was signiﬁcant.  In sum, this additional  analy- 
sis could not support  the hypothesis,  that reperfusion  of the ischemic  
penumbra  was driving  subacute  reactivation.  Similarly,  less fMRI acti- 
vation in acute stroke patients  could also be caused by a failure of the 
BOLD signal due to an acute disruption  of the neurovascular  coupling  
( Krainik  et al., 2005 ). However,  by contrasting  language  activation  in 
regions  with high and low lesion connectivity,  we again minimize  the 
potential  impact of such eﬀects because  it can be assumed  that BOLD- 
failure would aﬀect the whole vascular  territory  and not only regions  
functionally  connected  to the lesion. In addition,  longitudinal  BOLD sig- 
nal changes  in stroke patients  have been shown to reﬂect changes  in 
neural activity  rather than resolution  of disrupted  neurovascular  cou- 
pling ( Geranmayeh  et al., 2015 ). The same applies to in-scanner  per- 
formance.  One might argue that acute fMRI underactivation  could be 
caused by less engagement  in the task as in-scanner  performance  is de- 
creased  mostly at the acute measurement  (see Supplementary  Table 2). 
While the main eﬀect of ‘time’ could be interpreted  in such a way, our 
main ﬁnding  of a ‘time x connectivity’  interaction  is not impressible  by 
this argument  because  a performance  associated  decrease  of activation  
would not dependent  on lesion connectivity.  
Finally,  we would like to address  some limitations  of our study. First, 
our interpretation  that resolution  of diaschisis  leads to behavioral  im- 
provement  is fundamentally  linked to the correlation  analysis  of lon- 
gitudinal  changes  in fMRI activation  and behavioral  scores. In contrast  
to our hypothesis,  there was no such longitudinal  correlation  of behav- 
ioral improvement  and the resolution  of diaschisis  from the acute to 
the subacute  phase. On the one hand, the absence  of this correlation  in 
our data might be caused by confounding  reperfusion  eﬀects. As men- 
tioned before, hypoperfusion  and reperfusion  have an impact on acute 
behavioral  performance  and therefore  partially  mask eﬀects driven by 
diaschisis  and its resolution.  Indeed,  we found a signiﬁcant  correlation  
of mean fMRI activation  (regardless  of lesion connectivity)  and behav- 
ioral performance  in the acute phase ( r = 0.28, p = 0.04, n = 54) in an 
exploratory  analysis.  Although  we have argued in favor of the validity  
of diﬀerential  fMRI eﬀect sizes also in the acute phase, these arguments  do not apply to the behavioral  data. This might explain  the fact that 
our data supports  acute resolution  of diaschisis  in terms of connectiv-  
ity speciﬁc  fMRI reactivation  but without  correlating  with behavioral  
improvement.  On the other hand, we found a signiﬁcant  correlation  in 
the time period between  the subacute  and chronic  measurement.  Di- 
aschisis  is expected  to resolve mainly within the ﬁrst days to weeks af- 
ter stroke ( Carrera  and Tononi,  2014 ). Nevertheless,  the time period 
from the subacute  ( Ø= day 11) to the chronic  ( Ø= day 150) mea- 
surement  partially  overlaps  with the early post-stroke  phase ( ∼ﬁrst few 
weeks).  Therefore,  we speculate  that the described  longitudinal  correla-  
tion from the subacute  to the chronic  measurement  might nevertheless  
reﬂect behavioral  improvement  caused by resolution  of diaschisis  in the 
ﬁrst few weeks. Alternatively,  diaschisis  eﬀects might partially  persist 
substantially  longer than a few weeks after stroke onset ( DeMarco  and 
Turkeltaub,  2020 ; Price et al., 2001 ) and therefore  might render it a 
potential  target for adjuvant  non-invasive  brain stimulation  in neurore-  
habilitation.  Second,  the present  study exclusively  considers  damage  
to gray matter.  Future eﬀorts might additionally  incorporate  structural  
connectome  data to identify  ﬁber tracts and corresponding  cortical  re- 
gions aﬀected  by disconnection  mechanisms  due to white matter dam- 
age ( Foulon et al., 2018 ; Fox, 2018 ; Yourganov  et al., 2016 ). Third, 
in lesion network  mapping,  lesions are used as regions  of interest  for 
resting-state  functional  connectivity  analyses.  However,  these regions  
of interest  follow vascular  territories  and might thus be very heteroge-  
neous in terms of functional  anatomy.  They range from small lesions 
in a single functional  network  to large lesions spanning  multiple  func- 
tional networks.  This might lead to some bias in the corresponding  le- 
sion network  maps which might be less accurate  and less meaningful  
with increasing  lesion sizes ( Boes, 2021 ). Finally,  we exclusively  stud- 
ied post-stroke  aphasia.  Yet, our methodological  approach  might also 
be of value for other stroke induced  (higher  order) deﬁcits  or even data 
sets featuring  multiple  behavioral  domains.  
7. Conclusion  
We combined  lesion network  mapping  and task-based  fMRI to exam- 
ine resolution  of functional  diaschisis  eﬀects in patients  with post-stroke  
aphasia  due to cortical  infarctions.  We found that resolution  of neural 
dysfunction,  as expressed  by an increase  of fMRI activation  over time 
distant to the lesion, depends  on normative  functional  connectivity  to 
the lesion site. Because  this eﬀect was behaviorally  relevant,  we argue 
that resolution  of diaschisis  might be a relevant  mechanism  contribut-  
ing to the early fast behavioral  improvement  often seen in patients  with 
aphasia.  Additionally,  the presented  data demonstrate  that lesion net- 
work mapping  is a suitable  approach  to study diaschisis  eﬀects based 
solely on the lesion location  inferred  from clinical  imaging.","(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+and\s+code\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data\s+availability |(?<![\'""]) \s*?\n?Data/code\s+availability","<re.Match object; span=(30190, 30218), match=' Data and code availability '>","<re.Match object; span=(24802, 24813), match='  \nFunding '>"

Pain can be experienced  even before a noxious  event causes harm, 
and the experience  of pain is necessary  for predicting  the resulting  tis- 
sue damage.  Pain intensity  conveys  information  about the threat level 
perceived  from a noxious  event. However,  this process  is bi-directional;  
the bottom-up  nociceptive  input is processed  and modulated  by top- 
down factors such as cues, inferred  context  and prior mental states 
( Bouton  and Bolles, 1979 ; Fadok et al., 2017 ; LeDoux  and Daw, 2018 ). 
Top-down  factors modulate  nociceptive  input and alter the experi- 
ence of pain through  a connected  network  of cortical  and brainstem  
regions  ( Lin et al., 2014 ; Fields, 2018 ). Of speciﬁc  importance  in the 
brainstem  are the periaqueductal  gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial  
medulla  (RVM) ( Basbaum  and Fields, 1984 ; Lumb, 2004 ). Projections  
from this system descend  to the spinal cord to alter spinal dorsal horn

The PAG is organized  in four columnar  subdivisions  of which the dor- 
solateral/lateral  (dl/lPAG)  and ventrolateral  (vlPAG)  regulate  responses  
to nociceptive  inputs ( Carrive,  1993 ). This columnar  organization  has 
been recorded  in a few animal studies ( Lumb et al., 2002 ; Keay and 
Bandler,  2002 ) and was more recently  demonstrated  with brain imag- 
ing in humans  ( Ezra et al., 2015 ; Coulombe  et al., 2016 ). The dl/lPAG  
is functionally  organized  for generating  responses  that require  a sym- 
pathetic  motor ﬁght, ﬂight, and fright response  ( Kincheski  et al., 2012 ; 
Mochny  et al., 2013 ; Watson  et al., 2016 ). It receives  inputs from noci- 
ceptors  that have high conduction  velocities  (A-delta  ﬁbers), producing  
sharp pain sensations  with shorter attention  latencies  ( Bandler  et al., 
2000 ; Parry et al., 2008 ; Koutsikou  et al., 2017 ) and is linked with rapid 
and active responses  to physical  threats ( Roelofs,  2017 ). The vlPAG re-

We prepared  the brain of a healthy  adult male rhesus macaque  mon- 
key ( Macaca  mulatta  ) weighing  13.55 kg using a well-controlled  tran- 
scardial  perfusion  ﬁxation,  as described  in ( Saleem  et al., 2021 ). All 
procedures  were carried out under a protocol  approved  by the Insti- 
tutional  Animal  Care and Use Committee  of the National  Institute  of 
Mental Health (NIMH)  and the National  Institute  of Health (NIH) and 
adhered  to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory  Animals  (Na- 
tional Research  Council).  Like the human brain, the macaque  monkey  
brain is gyrencephalic  but due to its smaller  size, it can be imaged  more 
eﬃciently  with high-resolution  dMRI and subsequently  processed  with 
whole-brain  histological  analysis.  Based on a preliminary  structural  MRI 
scan of the specimen,  we printed  a three-dimensional  (3D) brain mold 
inside a cylindrical  acrylic plastic container.  The specimen  was placed 
inside the mold and prepared  for MRI scanning.  The container  was ﬁlled 
with fomblin  and gently stirred under vacuum  for 4 hours to remove  air 
bubbles.  Subsequently,  the container  was sealed and prepared  for MR 
imaging  using a Bruker 7T horizontal-bore  MRI scanner  and a Bruker

Candidates  were right-handed  patients  aﬀected  by a glioma in the 
left hemisphere  requiring  the complete  or the partial exposure  of the 
parietal  lobe. Neuroradiological  inclusion  criteria  were applied  irre- 
spective  of tumor location,  based on an extensive  and multidisciplinary  
preoperative  evaluation  involving  standard  MR studies (T1, FLAIR and 
DWI) (Philips  Intera 3T scanner,  Best). Patients  with tumor occupying  
more than 10 cc of the parietal  lobe, were not included.  Patients  who 
received  previous  neurosurgical  treatment  and/or patients  that showed  
preoperative  sensorimotor  and/or praxis deﬁcits  were not included.  Sen- 
sorimotor  deﬁcits  were assessed  by means of standard  neurological  ex- 
amination  and Action Research  Arm Test (ARAT)  test, while upper limb 
apraxia  has been assessed  by means of De Renzi test. All patients  gave 
written  informed  consent  to the surgical  and mapping  procedure  and to 
use of data for research  purposes,  which followed  the principles  outlined  
in the “World  Medical  Association  Declaration  of Helsinki:  Research  in- 
volving  human subjects"".  The study was performed  with strict adherence  
to the routine  procedure  normally  utilized  for surgical  tumor removal.  
Finally,  thirty-four  right-handed  patients  were enrolled  in this study 
(mean age 46 ± 12.5 SD, range 25-75, n = 19 with high-grade  glioma;  
n = 14 with low-grade  glioma,  n = 1 others).  Selected  patients  showed  
a normal  score for the upper limb apraxia  (De Renzi test), no basic sen- 
sory and motor deﬁcits  (neurological  examination)  and scored 57 (the 
highest  score) in the Action Research  Arm test (ARAT).  Among  them, 
in 20 patients  the tumor was growing  in parietal  areas (mean volume  
of 9.79cc ± 8.2), in 8 patients  in the frontal lobe not inﬁltrating  the 
precentral  gyrus (mean volume  11.95cc  ± 8.47) and in 6 patients  in the 
temporal  lobe (mean volume  16.8cc ± 5.68). The main aim of the study 
was to investigate  the parietal  lobe and, due to the surgical  approach,

the most extensive  exploration  was allowed  mainly when the tumor was 
located  within the parietal  white matter.  In order to overcome  as much 
as possible  the eﬀects due to the presence  of the tumor within the inves- 
tigated area, we selected  patients  with a parietal  tumor volume  not ex- 
ceeding  the 10 cc. Only two patients  exceeding  this value were included,  
since their responses  ﬁtted spatially  with the overall stimulation  sample 
of eﬀective  sites. Among  frontal and temporal  tumors,  we selected  pa- 
tients requiring,  for clinical  need, to have the postcentral  gyrus and/or 
the inferior  parietal  lobe exposed  and to execute  HMt.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(12774, 12779), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5313, 5319), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119344,"2.1. Participants  
The 324 participants  consist of 158 people with clinically  diagnosed  
MCI and 166 controls,  recorded  at one of two sites: 1) the MRC Cog- 
nition & Brain Sciences  Unit (CBU) at the University  of Cambridge,  
and 2) the Laboratory  of Cognitive  and Computational  Neuroscience  at 
the Centre for Biomedical  Technology  (CTB), Madrid.  The participants  
were pooled over a number  of diﬀerent  projects,  each approved  by local 
Ethics Committees  and following  the 1991 Declaration  of Helsinki.  Par- 
ticipants  consented  to the collection  and sharing  of de-identiﬁed  data 
for research  purposes.  The 68 MCI patients  scanned  at Cambridge  were recruited  from spe- 
cialist memory  clinics at Cambridge  University  Hospitals  NHS Trust. In- 
dividuals  were diagnosed  with MCI after referral  for symptoms,  mainly 
memory  problems  (i.e., they were not derived  by screening  of cogni- 
tively asymptomatic  people).  The diagnosis  was made in a regional  
memory  clinic, including  ACE/ACER  and MMSE tests as standard,  with 
a signiﬁcant  deﬁcit in memory  domain  tests. PET and ﬂuidic Biomark-  
ers were not used as standard,  although  all had structural  brain imaging  
(usually  MRI in the clinic unless contraindicated,  when a CT was oc- 
casionally  used) and clinical  follow-up  in support  of the diagnosis.  By 
deﬁnition  of MCI, suﬀerers  had functional  independence  at the time of 
diagnosis.  MRI was used to exclude  other pathologies  and to identify  
features  consistent  with MCI/AD  pathology  (e.g. MTL atrophy  without  
mass lesion, high vascular  burden).  Patients  had no obvious  major psy- 
chiatric  disorder.  
The 91 controls  from Cambridge  were selected  from the population-  
derived  CamCAN  cohort of healthy  people from the same geographic  
region ( www.cam-can.org  ), chosen to have similar age and sex distri- 
bution.  The CBU controls  are screened  to be healthy,  i.e., have MMSE 
(and indeed ACE-R)  scores above conventional  cut-oﬀs,  as well as 
other screening  described  in the CamCAN  protocol  paper ( Shafto et al., 
2014 ). 
The 90 patients  and the 75 controls  from Madrid  were recruited  from 
the Neurology  and Geriatric  Departments  of the University  Hospital  San 
Carlos. The MCI diagnosis  of the patients  was determined  with interme-  
diate probability  according  to the National  Institute  on Aging–Alzheimer  
Association  criteria  ( Albert et al., 2011 ), i.e., given by a clinician  based 
on clinical  and cognitive  tests, self- and informant-report,  and in the ab- 
sence of full dementia  or obvious  other causes. For some patients,  there 
was additional  biomarker  evidence  of atrophy  from MRI or long-term  
follow up and genotyping  for the APOE 𝜀 4 allele. The diagnosis  required  
an objective  impairment  in the memory  domain  and/or other cognitive  
functions,  but a subjective  ""memory  complaint""  was not required,  and 
(as a requirement  for the diagnosis  criteria),  they were able to still per- 
form their daily living activities.  MRI (T1, T2 and/or FLAIR) was used to 
rule out a vascular  disorder,  and any other type of neurological  disease  
(i.e., tumour,  stroke, infection)  that could better explain  the cognitive  
symptoms.  
The CTB controls  had a full neuropsychological  assessment  to con- 
ﬁrm normal  cognition,  and the same type of MRI assessment  as that 
done in the MCI group, i.e., a radiologist  reported  MRIs as normal.  All 
participants  were free of any signiﬁcant  neurological  or psychiatric  dis- 
order, including  vascular  damage  (Hachinski  score equal or less than 4, 
plus observation  of T2-weighted  MRI) and depression  (geriatric  depres-  
sion score equal or less than 5), or any medication  with known eﬀects 
on MEG activity.  
Note that the MRI (and MEG) data provided  here were research  scans 
following  diagnosis,  and were not used to inform the diagnosis,  though 
other similar (T1-weighted)  clinical  MRIs may have been used by the 
diagnosing  clinician.  For a subset of MCI patients,  we indicate  whether  
or not they subsequently  progressed  to dementia  ( “probable  AD ”) over 
subsequent  years, according  to their managing  clinician.  
The distributions  of participant  sex, age, education,  and score on a 
cognitive  test for dementia  - the Mini-Mental  State Examination  (MMSE)  
- are shown in Table 1 . As expected  (since part of the diagnosis),  the MCI 
group scored lower on the MMSE, with most below the common  clinical  
threshold  of 27 ( O’Bryant  et al., 2008 ). While MMSE may lack sensitiv-  
ity to MCI, its widespread  use, approval  as a clinical  trial outcome  and 
multiple  language  versions  make it a suitable  screening  tool. T-tests con- 
ﬁrmed that the MCI group was also slightly  older and less well educated  
on average,  though there was considerable  variance  across patients  and 
appreciable  overlap  between  them and the controls,  enabling  subgroup  
matching  where relevant  to future analyses.  
Note that comparable  resting-state  MEG data (and T1-weighted  
MRIs) acquired  at the CBU site are also available  for approxi-  
mately 600 healthy  participants  (aged 18-88 years) via the Cam-

These data could be used with machine  learning  to characterise  healthy  
MEG data or predict age, which could then be tested on the present  
patient data.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9101, 9106), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(5668, 5674), match='\n2.2. '>"

Shock, 1985 ). The goal of the BLSA and GESTALT  studies is to evaluate  
multiple  biomarkers  related to aging, and their inclusion  and exclusion  
criteria  are essentially  identical.  Participants  were excluded  if they have 
metallic  implants,  or major neurologic  or medical  disorders.  All partic-

UK Biobank  (UKB) is a large national  project that collects  a wide 
range of health-related  measures  for over 500,000  subjects,  initially  aged between  40 and 69. We used the resting-state  and task functional  
MRI data from a total of 17,560 subjects.  The acquisition  parameters  
and processing  details can be found in Miller et al. (2016) , Alfaro- 
Almagro  et al. (2018) . Brieﬂy,  all resting-state  fMRI scans were acquired  
with identical  scanners  (3T Siemens  Skyra) with a TR of 735ms for a to- 
tal of 490 time points for each individual.  After the initial preprocessing,  
the data were ICA-FIX  cleaned  to remove  structured  artefacts  ( Salimi- 
Khorshidi  et al., 2014 ), and then registered  to the standard  MNI space. 
Next, each individual’s  resting-state  4D time series were further spa- 
tially smoothed  with a Gaussian  kernel of sigma 3mm. The task used 
is the Hariri faces/shapes  “emotion  ”t a s k ( Barch et al., 2013; Hariri 
et al., 2002 ), scanned  and processed  under the same protocols  as the 
resting-state  data (except  that the task-fMRI  data is not ICA-denoised).  
Individual  as well as group-average  activation  z-statistic  maps of three 
contrasts  (faces, shapes,  and faces-shapes)  were estimated  from the task 
fMRI scans using FEAT ( Woolrich  et al., 2004; 2001 ). Additionally,  473 
subjects  in this 17,560 subset received  second-time  scanning  (mean test-

Participants  were enrolled  in either the UC Davis MIND Institute  
Autism Phenome  Project,  Girls with Autism –I m a g i n g  of Neurodevel-  
opment  (GAIN),  or Brain Research  in Autism Investigating  Neurophe-  
notypes  (BRAIN)  studies.  These associated  studies have a shared longi- 
tudinal design that includes  enrollment,  baseline  MRI, and behavioral  
assessment  at 2–4 years of age (Time 1) and planned  follow up across 
childhood  and adolescence.  Participants  in the GAIN and BRAIN studies 
are considered  to be part of the APP. The present  cross-sectional  study 
included  a balanced  subset of ASD and TD, male and female participants  
selected  from all participants  who successfully  completed  MRI at Time 1 
( Table 1 ). Balanced  samples  were achieved  using procedures  described  
below. Participants  were required  to be native English  speakers,  ambu- 
latory, have no contraindications  for MRI, and no known or suspected  
vision or hearing  problems,  identiﬁed  genetic  disorders  (e.g. Fragile X) 
or neurodevelopmental  conditions.  At Time 1, ASD diagnosis  was conﬁrmed  using the Autism Diagnostic  
Observation  Schedule-Generic  (ADOS-G)  ( Lord et al., 2000 ) or ADOS-2  
( Lord et al., 2012 ), the Autism Diagnostic  Interview-Revised  (ADI-R)  
( Lord et al., 1994 ) and DSM-IV-TR  criteria  ( American  Psychiatric  As- 
sociation  Diagnostic  and Statistical  Manual  of Mental Disorders  (DSM- 
4®), 2000 ). Non-autistic,  non-developmentally  delayed  children  were 
enrolled  as TD controls.  TD children  were screened  for autism traits us- 
ing the Social Communication  Questionnaire  (SCQ; Rutter et al., 2003 ) 
and had developmental  scores within two standard  deviations  on all sub- 
scales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning  (MSEL)  ( Mullen,  1995 ); 
they also had no ﬁrst-degree  relatives  at the time of enrollment  with 
an ASD diagnosis.  The MSEL was not administered  to one TD male who 
was assessed  using the Stanford  Binet 5th edition abbreviated  IQ battery  
(Roid, 2003). Informed  consent  and permission  was obtained  from the 
parent or guardian  of each participant.  All aspects  of the study protocol  
were approved  by the University  of California  Davis Institutional  Re- 
view Board. For additional  details and assessments  see supplementary

Incomplete  or non-usable  data is not shared (see Table 1 for an 
overview  of the number  of participants  and pairs for which data is 
shared).  First, two participants  from diﬀerent  pairs exceeded  our age 
criteria  and misunderstood  instructions,  leaving  140 individual  partici-  
pants, and 69 complete  pairs. 
MRI data from a total of 16 participants  were excluded  due to MRI 
scanner/software  malfunction  ( n = 6); missing  data due to participant  
claustrophobia  ( n = 4); excessive  motion within or between  sessions  
( n = 3); bad performance  on the one-back  task ( n = 2); and experimenter  
error ( n = 1); see the Participants  folder in the Dataset  for more details.  
Note that exclusion  of MRI data based on motion or one-back  perfor- 
mance was only done for extreme  cases. Researchers  may still want to 
deal with motion artifacts  and/or errors in the one-back  task while pre- 
processing  and analysing  the shared data. 
There are 124 individual  participants  and 56 complete  pairs with 
complete  and shared (f)MRI data. Furthermore,  (f)MRI data of three

“tiers ”(rows at the bottom of the window).  The ﬁrst two tiers include the transcribed  speech for the participant  on the left ( “A_po ”) and right ( “B_po ”; where “po ”

extra participants  is still shared because  only session three is incomplete  
and this may be irrelevant  for some users of the data. 
Audio/video  data from the interactive  sessions  are shared in the 
Dataset,  except for seven cases where one or both participants  did not 
provide  consent.  We focused  our transcription  resources  on a selection  
of 47 interactions,  based on their (audio)  quality and completeness  of 
the MRI data (see above).  However,  audio/video  data is shared for 42 of 
these pairs, four pairs contain  individuals  with non-usable  MRI data, and 
questionnaire  data are missing  for one pair (these issues were encoun-  
tered only after transcription  had ﬁnished).  Thus, all data (i.e., fMRI, 
behavioural,  and transcription/interaction  data) is usable for 42 pairs 
(84 participants)  in total. For 37 of these 42 pairs, thanks to participant  
consent,  the video and audio data can be shared as well.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118801,"2.1. Dataset 
We used rs-fMRI  data of the HCP 1200-subjects  release ( https://  
www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/  ). After consult-  
ing with the Safety Management  Division  at RIKEN,  we conﬁrmed  
that institutional  approval  was not required  for the use of the HCP dataset.  Each fMRI image was acquired  with a temporal  resolution  of 
0.72 s and a 2 mm isotropic  spatial resolution  using a customized  3-T 
Siemens  Skyra scanner  ( Smith et al., 2013 ). Individual  subjects  under- 
went four rs-fMRI  runs of 14.4 min each (1200 frames per run), with 
eyes open, with a relaxed  ﬁxation  on a projected  bright cross-hair  on a 
dark background.  The rs-fMRI  data were preprocessed  with the HCP 
spatial and temporal  preprocessing  pipelines.  Brieﬂy,  spatial prepro-  
cessing included  spatial distortion  correction,  motion correction,  and 
transformation  to the Montreal  Neurological  Institute  template  space 
( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). Temporal  preprocessing  included  high-pass  tem- 
poral ﬁltering  (cutoﬀ of  2000s),  ICA-FIX  cleanup,  and motion-related  
time-course  removal  ( Smith et al., 2013 ). Details on the ICA-FIX  cleanup  
have previously  been described  ( Griﬀanti  et al., 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi  
et al., 2014 ). Our analysis  began with the preprocessed  rs-fMRI  data 
(e.g., rfMRI_REST1_LR_hp2000_clean.nii.gz  ). 
We selected  59 behavioral  measures  from the HCP dataset,  which 
cover seven behavioral  categories,  i.e., cognition,  alertness,  motor, sen- 
sory, in-scanner  task performance,  personality,  and emotion  (Supple-  
mentary  Table 1). These behavioral  measures  were comprised  of 58 
measures  used in a previous  study ( Liégeois  et al., 2019 ) and a mea- 
sure (i.e., CogFluidComp_Unadj  ). In addition  to the 59 measures,  we used 
ﬁve subject demographics,  i.e., age ( Age_in_Yrs  ), gender ( Gender ), race 
( Race ), education  ( SSAGA_Educ  ), and percentage  of rs-fMRI  scan com- 
pletion ( 3T_RS-fMRI_PctCompl  ). 
The HCP 1200-subjects  release includes  data on 1206 healthy  young 
adult subjects.  For our analysis,  we selected  subjects  who met the fol- 
lowing conditions:  (i) Subjects  with no missing  data for the 59 behav- 
ioral measures  and ﬁve subject demographics;  (ii) Subjects  who com- 
pleted all the rs-fMRI  runs (i.e., 3T_RS-fMRI_PctCompl  ); (iii) Subjects  who 
scored ≥ 27 on the Mini-Mental  State Examination  (i.e., MMSE_Score  ) 
( O’Bryant  et al., 2008 ); (iv) Subjects  who clearly reported  their race 
(i.e., we excluded  subjects  with ”Unknown  or Not Reported  ”); and (v) 
Subjects  with head motion ≤ 0.15 in all the rs-fMRI  runs (i.e., Move- 
ment_RelativeRMS_mean.txt  ). Consequently,  829 subjects  (388 men, 441 
women,  mean age: 28.6 ± 3.7 years) were selected  based on the above 
conditions.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9961, 9966), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2860, 2866), match='\n2.2. '>"
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119122,"1. Introduction  
While Magnetic  Resolution  Imaging  (MRI) and electroencephalo-  
gram (EEG) are widely regarded  as progressive  tools to study the neural 
correlates  of behavior  ( Morita et al., 2016 ), issues of reproducibility  
and bias have attracted  much attention.  In alignment  with the 2015 
Open Science  Collaboration  recommendations  concerning  reproducibil-  
ity ( Open Science  Collaboration,  2015 ), the current  commentary  aims to 
obtain a sample the participant  demographics  of functional  neuroimag-  
ing studies and explore  the related methodological  constituents  that up- 
hold such biases in cognitive  neuroscience.  
As neuroscientists  increasingly  recognize  social and environmen-  
tal inﬂuences  on neural mechanisms  and their manifestations,  statisti-  
cally controlling  for such participant  idiosyncrasies  has become  essential  
( Farah, 2017 ; Gilmore  et al., 2017 ; Sauce and Matzel,  2013 ). Investiga-  
tions into social and epigenetic  inﬂuences  have largely refuted  theories  
of cognition  rooted in biological  reductionism,  demanding  the acknowl-  
edgment  of relevant  psychological,  environmental,  and social eﬀects on 
the brain ( Champagne,  2010 ; Morita et al., 2016 ). The failure to ac- 
knowledge  individual  variation  can have profound  eﬀects, and many 
hypothesize  that such neglect  contributes  to the ﬁeld’s contention  with 
reproducibility  and generalizability  ( Chatterjee,  2005 ; Isamah  et al., 
2010 ). 
The current  commentary  aims to explore  demographic  inﬂuences  
through  the categories  of race and ethnicity.  Both constructs  are widely 
disputed  and harbor culturally  variable  deﬁnitions  and applications

bitrarily  classifying  humans.  Concepts  of race/ethnicity  are historically  
prescribed  to reﬂect economic,  political,  social, and cultural  conditions,  
and their boundaries  are heavily  inﬂuenced  by colonialism  and imperi-  
alism ( Lee, 2009 ; Yellow Bird, 1999 ). Regardless,  race and ethnicity  are 
not inconsequential  identiﬁers,  and contemporary  dialogue  should aim 
to refute deterministic  deﬁnitions  of race and ethnicity.  
Racial categories  have widespread  eﬀects, including  ﬁndings  of 
racial disparities  in clinical  outcomes  ( Brown et al., 2017 ; Díaz- 
Venegas  et al., 2016 ; Isamah  et al., 2010 ). For example,  Alzheimer’s  
Dementia  (AD) is nearly twice as prevalent  among Black versus white 
adults in the United States, and such rates cannot be explained  by cere- 
brovascular  factors and socioeconomic  status (SES) alone ( Manly et al., 
2008 ; Misiura  et al., 2020 ). Instead,  race eﬀects on cognition  likely 
arise through  the intersectional  layering  of unique sociocultural  fac- 
tors which are both sources  for biological  modiﬁcation  as well as ef- 
fects of their biological  embeddings  ( Lee, 2009 ; Manly et al., 2008 ; 
Roberts,  2011 ). Further  exploration  of race diﬀerences  in AD revealed  
race-speciﬁc  functional  connectivity  patterns  and electrophysiological  
diﬀerences  ( Misiura  et al., 2020 ). Similar  neural signaling  eﬀects by race 
have also been found with respect to other clinical  conditions  ( Chand 
et al., 2017 ; Hokett and Duarte,  2019 ). In an EEG study investigat-  
ing the inﬂuence  of race on sleep, Black participants’  EEG revealed  de- 
creased  power in the delta and beta bands, and eﬀects were independent  
from SES and education  ( Hall et al., 2020 ). Race has also been identi- 
ﬁed as a direct correlate  of cognitive  functioning  among older adults,

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119362,"2.1. Overview  
Balanced  steady-state  free precession  (SSFP, also known as True 
FISP/FIESTA)  is a widely used MRI sequence  especially  in cardiac  
MRI, featured  by its zero net (hence “balanced  ”) magnetic  gradient  
moment  within each TR ( Carr, 1958 ; Scheﬄer  and Lehnhardt,  2003 ). 
SSFP typically  has a very short TR of a few ms (well below tissue 
T 2 ) and TE = TR/2, which in combination  with the balanced  gradients,  
make SSFP signal a superposition  of a complex  mix of signal gener- 
ation pathways  ( Scheﬄer  and Hennig,  2003 ; Weigel,  2015 ). The sig- 
nal amplitude  is frequency  dependent  with a repeating  spectral  pat- 
tern 1/TR (in Hz) wide, each pattern  alternating  between  “pass-band  ”
and “transition-band  ”: When a moderate  to large ﬂip angle (e.g. 45°) 
is used, SSFP manifests  a unique T 2 /T 1 contrast  and insensitivity  to 
frequency  across the pass-band;  Within the transition  band, the sig- 
nal amplitude  rapidly  drops to zero. The transition  band is typically  
avoided  in SSFP applications  due to lack of tissue contrast,  except for 
a few niche applications  taking advantage  of its strong frequency  sen- 
sitivity ( Scheﬄer  et al., 2001 ; Miller, 2012 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). The 
alternating  pattern  of pass-bands  and transition-bands  can be observed  
in MRI by applying  a small magnetic  ﬁeld gradient  during SSFP imag- 
ing ( Fig. 1 A ), essentially  introducing  a linear frequency  oﬀset along the 
applied  gradient  ( Haacke  et al., 1990 ; Scheﬄer  et al., 2001 ; Markl and 
Pelc, 2004 ). Based on this imaging  principle,  Oshio et al. reported  that 
with a suﬃciently  high temporal  resolution,  CSF movement  with car- 
diac cycles can be qualitatively  visualized  near the dark transition-bands  
( Oshio et al., 2019 ). In this application,  SSFP in combination  with the 
background  gradient  oﬀset is essentially  a tagging  method  for motion 
detection  ( Axel and Dougherty,  1989 ; Yamada  et al., 2008 ). 
We applied  this method  to a group of healthy  volunteers  in a supine 
resting state and also when they performed  cued deep breaths  to ob- 
serve changes  in CSF ﬂow. In our case, the background  magnetic  ﬁeld 
gradient  was set to ∼0.3 mT/m for qualitative  observation,  leading  to 
equidistant  tags separated  by ∼15 mm. The SSFP images were acquired  
at 246 ms/frame,  suﬃciently  fast to sample the cardiac  pulsations  and 
other slower ﬂow mechanisms  ( Supplementary  Video ). During normal  
respiration,  periodic  tag displacement  and deformation  (and by infer- 
ence CSF ﬂow) can be observed  in the CSF spaces around the brainstem  
and spinal cord at both the cardiac  and respiratory  frequencies  ( Fig. 1 B ). 
During periodic  deep inspirations,  tag changes  increased  ( Fig. 1 C ). 
These observations  are consistent  with previous  reports on CSF ﬂow in- 
duced by arterial  and venous blood pressure  changes  with cardiac  and 
respiratory  cycles ( Dreha-Kulaczewski  et al., 2015 ; Yildiz et al., 2017 ; 
Aktas et al., 2019 ). Importantly,  in addition  to these immediate  baro- 
genic eﬀects, a delayed  myoactive  eﬀect was also observed  that evolved  
over a much longer time scale. Speciﬁcally,  deep inspirations  were fol- 
lowed by extended  periods  of upwards  tag displacement,  indicative  of 
cranial CSF ﬂow surges, with their delay and duration  consistent  with a 
myoactive  mechanism  ( Picchioni  et al., 2022 ). 
Having  identiﬁed  this novel, myoactive  type of CSF pulsations  in the 
SSFP data, we set out to determine  its strength  relative  to barogenic  pul- 
sations.  This required  translating  the observed  changes  in the SSFP tags 
into ﬂow velocities.  Because  of the complex  relationship  between  tag

changes  and temporal  ﬂow proﬁle,  including  diﬀerential  sensitivities  for 
rapidly  (i.e. cardiac  modulated)  and slowly (i.e. respiratory  modulated  
and myoactive)  changing  ﬂow, we opted to use a lookup table ( “ﬂow dic- 
tionary  ”) for this purpose.  To this end, we generated  a two-dimensional  
ﬂow dictionary  based on the simulated,  combined  eﬀects of both rapid 
(with a sinusoidal  velocity  change associated  with the cardiac  cycle), 
and slow (slower  processes  assumed  constant  over the cardiac  cycle) 
changes  in ﬂow on SSFP tags ( Fig. 2 ). The rapid and slow changes  are 
called “HF ﬂow ”a n d “LF ﬂow ” respectively,  for “high-frequency  ”a n d 
“low-frequency  ” components.  Phase shifts of the ﬂow relative  to the 
cardiac  cycle and changes  in cardiac  frequency  were accommodated  by 
generating  additional  dictionary  entries ( Fig. 2 C ). These dictionary  en- 
tries were then matched  through  correlation  to measured  tags for each 
cardiac  cycle, which are small data patches  with dimensions  of cross- 
tag spatial proﬁle by time (11 pixels by 1 cardiac  cycle). The latter are 
referred  to as “perturbation  patterns  ”. 
We performed  ﬂow quantiﬁcation  at the fourth ventricle  and near 
the foramen  of Magendie,  two lower brain positions  with minimal  spa- 
tial variation  of B 0 ﬁeld, despite the capability  of perturbation  patterns  
to qualitatively  capture  CSF dynamics  at multiple  locations  in the lower 
brain and the neck ( Fig. 1 ). This is because  the spatially  cyclic B 0 vari- 
ation originating  from cervical  vertebrae  was comparable  ( ∼60 Hz over 20 mm) to the background  gradient  oﬀset at 3 T, leading  to warping  of 
the perturbation  patterns  ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). Without  subject-  
speciﬁc  B 0 correction  of the images or dictionary,  this might bias the 
ﬂow quantiﬁcation  results.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10864, 10869), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(6912, 6918), match='\n2.2. '>"

We designed  a multi-step  decision  making  task ( Tartaglia  et al., 
2017 ) situated  in a state-space  with 7 circularly  arranged  fractal im- 
ages (states),  with 2 possible  actions at each state (apart from the goal 
which is a terminal  state) ( Fig. 1 B). At the beginning  of each episode,  
participants  were shown an initial state, randomly  chosen among two 
possible  initial states. As soon as a participant  chose an action, there 
was a random  time interval  of 2 to 7 seconds,  after which a diﬀerent  
image was shown ( Fig. 1 C). Participants  continued  to choose actions 
until they reached  the goal, which completes  an episode  ( Fig. 1 B and 
Fig. 1 C). They were instructed  that their task was to reach the goal in 
the smallest  number  of actions.  The image of the goal state was visually  
distinguishable  from all other states and known to participants  before- 
hand. State transitions  were deterministic,  with occasional  “surprise  tri-

From each state, the two actions led to new states at diﬀerent  dis- 
tances from the goal. The “correct  action ”i s deﬁned  as the one that 
brings the participant  closer (in terms of number  of actions)  to the goal 
state. Since two actions (leading  to two diﬀerent  target states 𝑠 ′) can be 
taken in each state 𝑠 , we characterize  a state 𝑠 by the “distance  from 
goal ”of its two possible  target states 𝑠 ′. For example,  from the state 𝑠 3 
of Fig. 1 B the correct action (green arrow) leads to the goal (0 actions 
from goal), whereas  the other action (red arrow) leads to state 𝑠 6 located  
3 actions away from the goal. We therefore  denote state 𝑠 3 as “0-or-3  ”. 
States that have equal minimum  distance  from goal may diﬀer in the 
resulting  distance  from goal when the “wrong  ”action  is chosen,  or, in 
other words, in their “diﬀerence  in correctness  ”between  the two avail- 
able actions.  For example,  for two states “0-or-3  ”and “0-or-1  ”choosing  
the correct action brings participants  to the goal, but choosing  the wrong 
one is more detrimental  for the “0-or-3  ”state. 
The state images and their locations  on the screen were randomized  
across participants  (for example,  state 𝑠 1 was not physically  next to 𝑠 2 , 
but could be positioned  at any location).  The assignment  of actions to 
left or right button presses were also randomized.  We deﬁned  two dif- 
ferent underlying  transition  matrices  (one of them is depicted  in Fig. 1 B) 
also in a randomized  way across participants.  The distance  of each state 
from goal and the actions’  “correctness  ”for both graphs are provided  in 
the Appendix  (Table A.1). The task was implemented  in Matlab using 
the Psychophysics  Toolbox  ( Brainard,  1997 ). 
2.1.2. Surprise  trials 
During the experiment  we ran in the background  the model-free  (MF) 
SARSA-  𝜆algorithm  ( Sutton and Barto, 1998 ) and the model-based  (MB) 
Forward  Learner  ( Gläscher  et al., 2010 ) with the participant’s  choices  
as inputs. This gave us an online estimate  of the values and the tran- 
sition probabilities  computed  by the two algorithms,  respectively.  The 
SARSA-  𝜆uses the RPE to update approximate  𝑄 -values 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) , i.e. the 
expected  sum of future discounted  rewards  starting  from state 𝑠 and ac- 
tion 𝑎 . The Forward  Learner  updates  the transition  probabilities  via the 
SPE and uses them to directly  compute  the 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) values via the Bellman  
equation.  More details on the algorithms  are provided  in sub section 2.4 
and in the Appendix  subsection  A.8. For the online RPE and SPE com- 
putations,  the choice of the parameters  (e.g. learning  rates 𝛼) was based 
on pilot experiments  performed  prior to this study. 
After participants  had encountered  the goal four times (i.e. com- 
pleted 4 episodes  of the task), we introduced  “surprise  trials ”. On a sur- 
prise trial, participants  transited  to a state 𝑠 ′′other than the one they had 
learned  to expect as the outcome  of action 𝑎 from state 𝑠 ( Fig. 1 D). We 
employed  two types of surprise  trials: (i) purely random  transitions,  and 
(ii) transitions  that met a threshold  criterion  on 𝑉 -values.  For the latter, 
if a participant  expected  to transit from 𝑠 to 𝑠 ′, the other state 𝑠 ′′was 
chosen such that 𝑠 ′and 𝑠 ′′had similar 𝑉 -values according  to the MF 
SARSA-  𝜆, i.e. ||𝑉 ( 𝑠 ′) − 𝑉 ( 𝑠 ′′) ||≤ Δ𝑉 where 𝑉 ( 𝑠 ) = max 𝑎 𝑄 ( 𝑠, 𝑎 ) and Δ𝑉 
was a small threshold.  This manipulation  does not aﬀect the MF sys- 
tem, since the experienced  RPE stays the same. For learned  transitions,  
in particular,  the RPE will take low values. At the same time, the ex- 
perienced  MB SPE will be high, since the learned  transition  has been 
violated  ( Fig. 1 D). 
In more detail, after each action taken by a participant,  from a state 
𝑠 to (an expected  state) 𝑠 ′, we checked  whether  the following  conditions  
were fulﬁlled:  (i) the transition  from 𝑠 to 𝑠 ′has been learned  according  to 
what has been previously  experienced  by the Forward  Learner  running  
in the background,  (ii) there is a state 𝑠 ′′that meets the aforementioned  
𝑉 -value threshold  criterion,  according  to the SARSA-  𝜆running  in the 
background,  and (iii) more than 3 trials have occurred  since the last 
surprise  trial. If these conditions  were fulﬁlled,  the participant  transited  
to 𝑠 ′′, and this constituted  a surprise  trial/surprising  transition.  More- 
over, if during 8 consecutive  trials no surprise  trial had occurred,  i.e. 
the above conditions  were not fulﬁlled,  a randomly  chosen unexpected  transition  was enforced  in order to ensure some variability  –excluding  
the goal state and the current  state from possible  landing  states. 
Without  unexpected  transitions,  the SPE would quickly  decrease  to 
low or zero values in a deterministic  graph after experience,  and unex- 
pected transitions  without  the 𝑉 -value criterion  explained  above would 
lead to a high SPE as well as a high RPE, resulting  in a high correla-  
tion between  these two signals.  Our novel experimental  manipulation  
with online monitoring,  however,  enables  us to increase  the variability  
of the SPE signal and to decorrelate  the RPE from the SPE at the same 
time. In order to prevent  participants  from resetting  their estimations  
and starting  learning  from scratch after an unexpected  transition,  i.e. 
prevent  them changing  their policy, we informed  participants  that the 
task graph does not change during the experiment  and the surprise  tri- 
als are outliers.  We note that our task design was based on previous  
literature  ( Daw et al., 2011; Doll et al., 2015a; Economides  et al., 2015; 
Gläscher  et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2013a ) and thus on the 
assumption  that SARSA and Forward  Learner  are likely the correct un- 
derlying  algorithms  (see Appendix  subsection  A.5 for more details and 
for the case that this assumption  is violated).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(14022, 14027), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(7300, 7306), match='\n2.2. '>"

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119622,"2.1. Rule 1: Decide the type and level of model 
Every model is built from components  —e.g.,  if modeling  neurons,  
these might include  the number  of diﬀerent  types of ion channels  and the 
numbers  of compartments  (i.e., sections,  each described  by its own set 
of equations)  into which each neuron is divided  ( Almog and Korngreen,  
2016; Gerstner  and Kistler, 2002 ). Before selecting  model components,  
it is necessary  to have a clear idea of the aims of the model. For exam- 
ple, does it only attempt  to describe  the statistics  of system variables  
without  regard to mechanisms,  or perhaps  to achieve  a phenomenolog-  
ical classiﬁcation  into healthy  and disordered  cases, for example?  Al- 
ternatively,  by addressing  the actual physical  system (the focus of these 
rules), does it aim to establish  just the in-principle  possibility  of model- 
ing a phenomenon;  to show that a particular  approach  is plausible;  to 
obtain qualitatively  correct results;  or to quantitatively  reproduce  and 
predict experimental  data? Figure 1 shows the spectrum  of modeling  aims on the horizontal  
axis, with the typically  required  model style shown on the vertical  axis, 
ranging  from toy models that have only the crudest  representation  of 
the system and few parameters  up to detailed  physically  realistic  mod- 
els with many parameters.  A typical historic  progression  is from lower 
left toward upper right, but the arrows indicate  that this implies  a need 
for more detailed  model components  (e.g., a variety of ion channels  in 
the example  in the previous  paragraph),  correspondingly  more param- 
eters, and better data; simultaneously,  tractability  of solving  the model 
decreases,  so more sophisticated  analytic  methods  and greater computa-  
tional power are required.  A model well below the main diagonal  would 
tend to be inadequate  to achieve  its aims, while one well above the di- 
agonal would tend to be over-complicated  relative  to those aims (or the 
aims could be made more ambitious).  Having  said this, sometimes  new 
insights  enable a simpler  model to achieve  more than a complex  one. 
For example,  the Epileptor  model exploits  the universal  nature of certain 
nonlinear  behaviors  to set aside many details of underlying  mechanisms  
to obtain insight into epileptic  seizure dynamics  —a signiﬁcant  advance  
for clinical  use, although  it necessarily  postpones  the question  of exactly 
which detailed  mechanisms  are in operation  ( Jirsa et al., 2014 ).",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(7286, 7291), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(2568, 2574), match='\n2.2. '>"

5. Implementing  a SS-EP study 
5.1. Study design 
5.1.1. Direct or indirect paradigm?  
As illustrated  in the previous  literature  overview,  there are two disso- 
ciable experimental  approaches  to investigate  a given cognitive  process  
using SS-EPs.  
In a ﬁrst approach,  the experimental  paradigm  is designed  to peri- 
odically  trigger the cognitive  or sensory  process  of interest  at a ﬁxed 
frequency  throughout  the stimulation.  Importantly,  the paradigm  must 
ensure that the process  of interest  can be isolated  from lower-lever  pro- 
cesses. For example,  in Buiatti et al. (2019) a schematic  facelike  pat- 
tern is periodically  presented  to newborns,  triggering  facelike  pattern  
detection  processes  at every cycle of the stimulation.  In this study, a 
non-facelike  pattern  control condition  is used to isolate the cognitive  
process  of interest.  Another  prime example  of direct paradigms  is the 
fast-periodic  oddball  paradigm  (e.g. ( de Heering  and Rossion,  2015 ) de- 
scribed  in section 3.1 ) in which the stimulation  stream is built hierarchi-  
cally, with infrequent  stimuli embedded  at a slow frequency  rate, within 
a faster periodic  stream of stimuli.  This dual frequency  design allows for 
dissociating  the rate of the slow categorization  response  from that of the 
faster local low-level  changes  within a single stimulation  stream.  Note 
that the stimulation  frequency(ies)  used in direct paradigms  must be 
carefully  selected,  in order to ensure that the brain network  supporting  
the process  of interest  can sustain the driving  rhythm  (e.g., the 3-15 Hz 
frequencies  used with EEG must be lowered  to 0.1-0.5 Hz with fMRI; 
Gao et al. 2018 ). 
The second indirect  approach  consists  in tagging  low-level  sen- 
sory features  (e.g., contrast)  while participants  are engaged  in a (non- 
rhythmic)  cognitive  task, and inspecting  how experimental  conditions  
modulate  the low-level  sensory  response.  SS-EP modulations  arise from 
top-down  eﬀects whereby  the cognitive  process  of interest  induces  
changes  in attention,  or cognitive  load. Importantly,  the low-level  fea- tures should remain as similar as possible  across experimental  condi- 
tions. For example,  in Kabdebon  and Dehaene-Lambertz  (2019) , the 
background  of a target image was ﬂickered  at a ﬁxed rate, and the au- 
thors reported  enhanced  SS-EPs when the image was expected.  The dis- 
tinction  between  these two types of experimental  paradigms  –direct  and 
indirect  –is crucial for the interpretation  of the results.  
5.1.2. Which stimulation  frequency(ies)?  
The choice of the stimulation  frequency(ies)  should factor in (1) the 
properties  of the targeted  neural response,  (2) the properties  of the en- 
dogenous  background  physiological  noise, and (3) some practical  con- 
straints.  
The stimulation  frequency(ies)  should match the temporal  dynam-  
ics of the targeted  neural system(s):  sensory  responses  typically  have 
short latencies  and can be tagged at relatively  fast frequencies,  but as 
brain responses  move up the cortical  hierarchy,  their latency  typically  
increases  such that integrated  cognitive  responses  are usually  tagged 
at lower frequencies.  In other words, there is a ‘sweet spot’ in the fre- 
quency  domain  where stimulation  will elicit robust SS-EPs,  and ‘blind 
spots’ where the stimulation  will not elicit any sustained  response.  Crit- 
ically, these limitations  depend  upon the neurophysiological  properties  
of the underlying  neural system,  which varies with age. The frequen-  
cies yielding  robust responses  with adults may thus be inappropriate  to 
elicit SS-EP responses  in the infant brain, especially  for higher-level  cog- 
nitive processes.  Ideally,  the frequency  tuning function  of the targeted  
system should be deﬁned  ahead of the experiment  ( Alonso-Prieto  et al., 
2013 ). This, however,  represents  an important  cost, which is not always 
achievable.  
A second factor to consider  when choosing  the stimulation  frequency  
is the background  brain activity.  Indeed,  neural recordings  contain  
a wide range of spontaneous  ﬂuctuations  (termed  background  noise, 
by contrast  to the evoked  signal) which are not distributed  uniformly  
across frequencies.  Instead,  EEG typically  exhibits  an inverse  power law 
(or 1/f) distribution:  in other words, the recordings  are dominated  by 
slow ﬂuctuations,  especially  in young infants ( Eisermann  et al., 2013 ; 
Marshall  et al., 2002 ). Additionally,  some frequency  bands can show 
particularly  strong spontaneous  activity.  This is the case for the classi- 
cal alpha band (9-12Hz  in adult, 6-9Hz in infants ( Marshall  et al., 2002 )) 
over occipital  sites. As a result, unless the aim of the experiment  is to 
interact  with these endogenous  rhythms,  it is typically  recommended,  
whenever  possible,  to avoid these noisy frequency  bands in order to 
maximize  the signal-to  noise-ratio  at the targeted  frequency.  If it cannot 
be avoided,  the signal-to-noise  ratio can be increased  by presenting  a 
longer stream,  with more stimulation  cycles. However,  it is important  
to note that the distribution  of the background  noise level is impacted  
by the mental state of the participant  (e.g., asleep vs awake).  
Finally,  various  practical  aspects  of the experimental  design need 
to be considered.  First, the stimulation  frequency(ies)  must be com- 
patible with the duration  of the trials. A general  rule of thumbs  is to 
ensure that at least two to four stimulation  cycles ﬁt within a stimula-  
tion stream.  The larger the number  of cycles, the more robust the SS-EP 
response,  and the cleaner  the subsequent  analyses.  Another  potential  
limiting  factor is the stimulus  presentation  device. Stimulus  presenta-  
tion is indeed necessarily  synchronized  with the device’s  refresh rate, 
which can severely  restrict the range of possible  stimulation  frequen-  
cies. For example  with a visual ﬂickering  stimulation,  if all stimuli have 
to have a 50/50 on/oﬀ ratio  for the purpose  of the experiment,  then 
frequencies  are limited to even integer divisors  of the monitor’s  refresh 
rate (but see ( Andersen  and Müller,  2015 ) for interpolation  methods).  
Finally,  if the paradigm  involves  multiple  stimulation  frequencies,  one 
should ensure that the successive  frequencies  and their harmonics  can 
be separated  by a minimum  of 4 to 8 frequency  bins during the spec- 
tral analysis.  Failure to do so will allow cross-contamination  and an 
inﬂated  (or deﬂated)  estimate  of the true EEG power at the targeted  
frequency.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119673,"2.1. Experimental  datasets  and data processing  
We leveraged  anatomical  and functional  MRI data belonging  to two 
independently  acquired  datasets  that we describe  below. 
NKI dataset 
First, we considered  data from the Nathan  Kline Institute  Rock- 
land Sample  project ( Nooner  et al., 2012 ) (NKI-RS,  http://fcon_  
1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/  ). Institutional  Review  Board 
approval  was obtained  for this project at the Nathan  Kline Institute  
(#226781  and #239708)  and at Montclair  State University  (#000983  
A and #000983B)  in accordance  with relevant  guidelines.  All par- 
ticipants  gave written  informed  consent  or assent. The anonymized  
dataset is freely available  at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/  
indi/enhanced/neurodata.html  . The NKI dataset consists  of imaging  
data from a community  sample of subjects  across a large portion  of 
the human lifespan.  We focused  our analyses  to subjects  within the age range of 20–40 years old, to concentrate  on structure-function  relation-  
ships without  added inﬂuence  of age-related  changes.  The data process-  
ing resulted  in anatomical  and functional  networks  made of 100 nodes 
from 123 subjects.  
HCP dataset 
We also analyzed  data from the Human  Connectome  Project (HCP) 
( Van Essen et al., 2013 ), a consortium  projected  to construct  a map of 
human brain circuits  and their relationship  to behavior  in a large popu- 
lation of healthy  adults. The study was approved  by the Washington  Uni- 
versity Institutional  Review  Board and informed  consent  was obtained  
from all subjects.  It comprises  a large cohort of subjects  ( > 1000), from 
which multiple  imaging  data were acquired  (diﬀusion  MRI, resting-  
fMRI, task-fMRI  and MEG/EEG),  together  with behavioral  and genetic  
data. Details of the image acquisition  and minimal  preprocessing  can be 
found in ( Glasser  et al., 2013 ). We focused  only on the 100 unrelated  
subjects.  Of the 100 subjects,  5 have been excluded  after preprocess-  
ing. This resulted  in obtaining  structural  and functional  networks  of 95 
subjects  (56% female,  mean age = 29.29 ± 3.66, age range = 22–36).  
The processing  of the data was made with the same cortical  parcellation  
used for NKI data, which led to structural  and functional  networks  made 
of 100 nodes. 
Transformation  of anatomical  networks  into correlation  networks  
One important  consideration  to keep in mind when pursuing  analysis  
on structure-function  relationships,  is that these two types of networks  
have diﬀering  interpretations  and diﬀerent  topology.  Anatomical  net- 
works embody  physical  pathways  linking distinct  brain regions.  Their 
weights  represent  white-matter  ﬁber tracts and are all non-negative.  
Moreover,  while their density  might vary based on the dimension  of 
brain regions  (i.e., parcellation  adopted  in the data processing)  or recon- 
struction  procedure,  generally  they are sparse. On the contrary,  func- 
tional networks  encode statistical  relationships  between  the activity  
recorded  from distinct  brain regions.  In our case they measure  the cor- 
relation  of BOLD activity  between  two brain areas, resulting  in fully 
connected  networks  with either positive  and negative  weights.  
The diﬀerent  architecture  of anatomical  and functional  networks  
might hamper  topological  analysis  aimed at investigating  their rela- 
tionship,  biasing  the results.  For this reason,  after the reconstruction  
of anatomical  brain networks,  we converted  these sparse matrices  into 
structural  correlation  matrices  by computing  the Pearson’s  correlation  
between  each pair of rows, as in ( Amico and Goñi, 2018 ). In this way, 
the anatomical  edge weights  were restricted  to the interval  [−1 , 1] and 
the structural  matrices  were comparable  to the functional  ones. This 
is desirable  in light of the construction  of the multi-modal  multi-layer  
network.  
Note that SC and FC are two diﬀerent  objects and in principle  one 
can transform  any of the two to accommodate  the topology  of the other. 
We intentionally  manipulated  the SC matrices  in agreement  with the 
state-of-the-art  literature  on structure-function  relationship,  where bio- 
physical,  communication  or statistical  models operate  on structural  con- 
nectivity  to ﬁnd correlations  with functional  connectivity  ( Suárez et al., 
2020 ). 
Multi-modal  modularity  optimization  through  traditional  multi-layer  models 
The main objective  of this work was to study the relationship  be- 
tween functional  and structural  connectivity  from the perspective  of 
their shared and unique modular  structure.  For this sake, one possibil-  
ity is to recover  communities  of the brain networks  through  community  
detection  ( Fortunato,  2010 ), employing  an algorithm  based on modular-  
ity optimization.  Modularity  ( 𝑄 ) ( Girvan and Newman,  2002; Newman,  
2012; Newman  and Girvan,  2004 ) is a global quality function  that esti- 
mates how strongly  communities  are internally  connected  with respect 
to a chance level, so that optimizing  𝑄 results in the detection  of assor- 
tative communities,  i.e. groups of nodes that are internally  dense and

main diagonal  of a square matrix of dimension  [number  of nodes ×number of layers]. Modules  are found by optimizing  the modularity  function  on this network  
in which each node is connected  to itself across layers through  the resolution  parameter  𝜔 . (b) Extended  approach.  Functional  and structural  connectivity  matrices  
of each subjects  are aligned over the diagonal  of a square matrix sized [number  of nodes ×number of subjects  ×2 (type of connectivity)].  Modularity  optimization  
is run on this network,  considering  each node connected  to itself within modality  and across subjects  through  𝜔 , and between  type of connectivity  through  𝜂. (c) 
Schematic  representation  of the methods  used to investigate  the relationship  between  structural  and functional  modular  structure.  For each subject and point in the 
parameter  space identiﬁed  by 𝛾(spatial resolution  parameter),  𝜔 and 𝜂, we obtain a partition  of structural  and functional  networks  into modules  (left), on which we 
can compute  the nodal entropy.  By averaging  across subjects  we obtain an entropy matrix 𝐻 𝑠𝑓 of dimension  𝑁 ×𝑁 𝑝𝑎𝑟 (nodes ×combinations  of parameters)  (right)

externally  sparse. 𝑄 is deﬁned  as follows:  
𝑄 ( 𝛾) = ∑
𝑖𝑗 [ 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 − 𝛾𝑃 𝑖𝑗 ] 𝛿( 𝜎𝑖 , 𝜎𝑗 ) . (1) 
where 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 and 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 are the actual and expected  weights  of the link con- 
necting  nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗. The variable  𝜎𝑖 ∈{ 1 , 𝐾} indicates  to which cluster 
node 𝑖 belongs,  and 𝛿( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) is equal to 1 if 𝑥 = 𝑦 and 0 otherwise.  The pa- 
rameter  𝛾represents  a spatial resolution  weight that scales the inﬂuence  
of the null model, aﬀecting  the number  and size of modules  recovered.  
Using high 𝛾values results in many small communities  and vice-versa.  
A multi-layer  version  of 𝑄 has been introduced  to detect commu-  
nities in multi-layer  networks  ( Mucha et al., 2010 ), where layers cor- 
respond  to estimates  of the same network  at diﬀerent  points in time, 
individuals,  or connection  modalities.  The multi-layer  analog of 𝑄 is 
deﬁned  as: 
𝑄 ( 𝛾, 𝜔 ) = ∑
𝑖𝑗𝑟𝑡 [( 𝑊 𝑖𝑗𝑟 − 𝛾𝑃 𝑖𝑗𝑟 ) 𝛿𝑟𝑡 + 𝜔𝛿𝑖𝑗 ] 𝛿( 𝜎𝑖𝑟 , 𝜎𝑗𝑡 ) . (2) 
Nodes are linked to themselves  across layers through  the resolution  pa- 
rameter  𝜔 ( Fig. 1 a). Its value aﬀects the homogeneity  of communities  
across layers (indicated  through  𝑟 and 𝑡 ), in a way that small 𝜔 values 
emphasize  layer-speciﬁc  modular  structure,  while big 𝜔 values point out 
communities  shared across layers ( Puxeddu  et al., 2019 ). The optimiza-  
tion of 𝑄 ( 𝛾, 𝜔 ) returns,  for each layer, a partition  of the network  into as- 
sortative  communities,  whose dimensions  and consistency  across layers 
depend  on two parameters  of spatial and a cross-layers  resolution.  Ap- 
plying multi-layer  modularity  optimization,  instead  of the single-layer  
one to each network,  is generally  convenient;  the multi-layer  approach  
is more resistant  to noise ( Puxeddu  et al., 2021a ) and returns commu-  nity labels that are coherent  across layers, so that one can easily track 
their evolution.  
Historically,  applications  of this method  have been, almost exclu- 
sively, to time-varying  estimates  of functional  connectivity  ( Bassett 
et al., 2011; Betzel et al., 2017; Braun et al., 2015 ). However,  this multi- 
layer approach  can be also used to link structural  and functional  mod- 
ular organization.  Multiple  single-subject  SC and FC matrices  from the 
NKI can be averaged  across subjects  to form group representative  net- 
works. These, in turn, can be concatenated  in a two-layers  modular-  
ity matrix of dimension  𝑁 ×𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠  (number  of nodes ×connection  
modality:  100 ×2) on which modularity  optimization  can be iterated  
with diﬀerent  combination  of 𝛾and 𝜔 . In this case, 𝛾would impact the 
dimension  of the communities,  while 𝜔 their homogeneity  between  SC 
and FC.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(9231, 9236), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(9624, 9630), match='\n2.2. '>"

Twenty-six  participants  (12 females;  mean age: 25.46 ± 0.87 years; 
range: 20–38 years) took part in the present  study for payment  (9 €per 
h) or student  credits.  All participants  reported  normal  or corrected-to-  
normal  vision, no color blindness,  no diagnosed  heart-rhythm  abnormal-  
ities, no present  or past psychiatric  or neurological  disorders,  and no cur- 
rent use of medication.  Consent  was obtained  from all participants,  and 
the procedures  were approved  by the local ethics committee  at the De- 
partment  of Psychology  of LMU Munich  in accordance  with the Declara-

explored  cardio-visual  integration  in a similar task. Therefore,  we could 
not compute  the required  sample size a priori. However,  our sample size

3D-EPTI  acquires  highly-accelerated  k-t data using continuous  read- 
outs to track signal evolutions  with minimal  deadtime  and high read- 
out eﬃciency.  Time-varying  undersampling  patterns  are employed  to 
exploit the spatiotemporal  correlation  within and among readouts  for 
robust reconstruction  at high acceleration.  In the time domain,  the full 
signal evolutions  are represented  by a small number  of low-rank  sub- 
space bases in the reconstruction  process  to reduce the number  of un- 
knowns.  In the spatial domain,  the time-varying  complementary  sam- 
pling further improves  the reconstruction  based on principles  of parallel  
imaging  ( Griswold  et al., 2002 ; Pruessmann  et al., 1999 ; Sodickson  and 
Manning,  1997 ) and compressed  sensing  ( Lustig et al., 2007 ). Paral- 
lel imaging  helps the recovery  of undersampling  by taking advantage  
of the CAIPI-like  k-t controlled  aliasing  patterns.  Compressed  sensing  
(in the form of low-rank  regularization  on the basis coeﬃcient  maps) 
further reduces  aliasing  by exploiting  the incoherence  of the aliasing  
patterns  along both the spatial and temporal  dimensions.  After recon- 
struction,  the signal evolution  at each voxel is obtained,  expressed  as a 
linear combination  of the temporal  subspace  bases, which will then be 
used to match the simulated  signal evolutions  (dictionary)  to estimate  
the quantitative  parameters.",\n?2\.1\.,"<re.Match object; span=(10459, 10464), match='\n2.1.'>","<re.Match object; span=(1482, 1488), match='\n2.2. '>"

The goal of this project was to investigate  if high coﬂuctuation  mo- 
ments in resting state fMRI BOLD signals are discrete  events that drive 
functional  connectivity.  We used a combination  of real and simulated  
data for these analyses.  
The publicly  available  Midnight  Scan Club (MSC) dataset was used 
as our real sample dataset.  The MSC dataset contains  fMRI data from 
10 highly sampled  individuals  (5 females,  ages 24-34).  The data for each subject was collected  across 10 fMRI sessions  within 7 weeks. 
Across these sessions,  the MSC dataset includes  5 hours of resting state 
fMRI; this resting-state  data is the focus of our analyses.  One participant  
(MSC08)  has been excluded  from these analyses  because  of head motion 
and drowsiness  during rest. For single session-analysis  and simulations,  
sessions  with less than 333 usable timepoints  (6/90 sessions)  were ex- 
cluded.  All data collection  was approved  by the Washington  University  
Internal  Review  Board and written  informed  consent  was received  from 
all participants.  The dataset and processing  have been previously  de- 
scribed  in detail ( Gordon  et al., 2017 ). A summary  of relevant  details is

4.1. Behavioural  data 
Paired t-tests were conducted  to examine  whether  participants  re- 
sponded  diﬀerently  to static vs. motion events. No signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  
was found in their accuracies  (static M = 93.35%,  SD = 0.09, motion 
M = 95.11%,  SD = 0.08, t(25) = − 1.06, p > 0.3), but participants  reacted  
faster when processing  static events (static M = 1799 ms, SD = 452.02,  
motion M = 1931 ms, SD = 459.91,  t(25) = − 4.27, p < 0.0002).  In a lin- 
ear mixed eﬀects model controlling  for the eﬀect of run order and length 
of sentences,  the event type still had a signiﬁcant  eﬀect on reaction  time 
(t(2267)  = − 7.316, p < 0.001).  
4.2. fMRI data 
Three sets of analysis  were formed  on the fMRI data: univariate  
analyses,  multivariate  pattern  analyses  (MVPA)  and psychophysiolog-  
ical analyses  (PPI).

a single reminder  email. Figure 1 illustrates  the recruitment  approach.  
From 342 persons  who clicked the invitation  link, 82.75%  completed  
the questionnaire  and were included  in analysis,  corresponding  to an 
overall response  rate of 2.42 % and resulting  in N = 283 participants  to- 
be-analyzed.  It took participants  9.62 min on average  (3.17; numbers  
reported  in brackets  are standard  deviations)  to arrive at the ﬁnal slide 
of the questionnaire.  
Participants  were aged 43.89 years on average  (9.74), dominantly  
male (66 %), mostly trained  in psychology,  and reported  an average  re- 
search experience  of 16.58 years (8.49). Most were aﬃliated  with a uni- 
versity and reported  themselves  in cognitive  neuroscience.  Half of the 
sample held a full or associate  professorship  or a comparable  position  
( Figure 2 ). Participants  from the European  Union were overrepresented  
in the sample,  while the USA and UK ranked second and third in number  
of participants  ( Figure 3 , Table 1). 
Asked about their technical  software  expertise,  most participants  in- 
dicated  to work with Linux and Windows  operating  systems.  More than 
half of the participants  indicated  SPM software  (Wellcome  Department  
of Cognitive  Neurology,  London,  UK) as their preferred  neuroimaging  
analysis  software  and rated themselves  as experts  or advanced  users of 
their preferred  neuroimaging  analysis  software.  While 60% said that 
they preferred  to operate  neuroimaging  analysis  software  via command  
line interface,  31% preferred  a graphical  user interface  ( Figure 4 ). 
By clicking  the personalized  link, participants  were navigated  to an 
online form where they gave their informed  consent  before they could 
start with the questionnaire.  This research  was conducted  in accordance  
with the declaration  of Helsinki  and was approved  by the Ethics Com- 
mittee of the Medical  Faculty  Mannheim  of the University  of Heidelberg  
(ref. #2020-611N).

The data were 156 baseline  [11C]raclopride  scans of healthy  con- 
trol subjects  (sex 120 males and 36 females;  age 19-71 years, BMI range 
18-38, no information  about the menstrual  cycle) scanned  at Turku PET 
Centre between  2004 and 2018. Detailed  sample information  is shown 
in Table 1 (see also Table S6 for exclusion  criteria).  Studies  were in- 
cluded in the analysis  if they were baseline  scans with injected  dose > 
100 megabecquerel  (MBq) to avoid low signal-noise  ratio (SNR) (see 
Table S7 for radiochemical  details)  and the magnetic  resonance  (MR) 
scan and basic demographic  and anthropometric  information  (height,  
weight)  was available.  If multiple  baseline  scans were acquired  for an 
individual,  chronologically  ﬁrst scan was included  in the analysis.  The 
data were compiled  across 5 diﬀerent  PET scanners  (see Supplemen-  
tary Material  section Scanner  Considerations  for detailed  information).
