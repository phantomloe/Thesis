    "- True Positives (TP): The number of correct extractions by the extractor that matches the ground truth's extractions.\n",
    "- False Positives (FP): The number of extractions by the extractor that does not match the ground truth (incorrect extractions).\n",
    "- False Negatives (FN): The number of extractions in the ground truth that were not extracted (missed extractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** measures the accuracy of the extractor's and code's results and is calculated in the following manner: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$precision = TP / (TP + FP)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures the completeness of the extractor's and code's results and is calculated in the following manner: \n",

This is called raw agreement or observed agreement, and according to Bayerl and Paul [5] it is still the most common way of reporting agreement in the literature. Raw agreement is easy to measure and understand; however, agreement in itself does not imply that the annotation process is reliable, because some agreement may be accidental – and this accidental agreement could be very high.\" (Arstein 2017, p.299)\n",

T1w images were preprocessed using the minc-bpipe-library (https://github.com/CoBrALab/minc-bpipe-library), including bias field correction (Tustison et al., 2010), adaptive non-local means denoising (Manjón et al., 2010), head masking and brain extraction (Eskildsen et al., 2012) The resulting bias field corrected, head-masked images and brain masks of each subject were input into the CIVET algo-rithm (Ad-Dab’bagh et al., 2006; Lerch & Evans, 2005) (version 2.1.0) in order to obtain cortical mid-surfaces and vertex wise measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), describing CT and SA esti-mates at a total of 81924 points across the cortical mid-surface.  \n",

       "15  In this study we focus on vertex-wise measures of cortical macro-and microstructure. T1w images were preprocessed using the minc-bpipe-library (https://github.com/CoBrALab/minc-bpipe-library), including bias field correction (Tustison et al., 2010), adaptive non-local means denoising (Manjón et al., 2010), head masking and brain extraction (Eskildsen et al., 2012) The resulting bias field corrected, head-masked images and brain masks of each subject were input into the CIVET algo-rithm (Ad-Dab’bagh et al., 2006; Lerch & Evans, 2005) (version 2.1.0) in order to obtain cortical mid-surfaces and vertex wise measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), describing CT and SA esti-mates at a total of 81924 points across the cortical mid-surface.  \n",
