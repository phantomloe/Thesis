# Resources 
This folder contains various files essential for both the research and reporting process. 

Files: 
- *Findings_BigOverview.jpg* was created using Google Drawings. This image is used in the report. 
- *Methodology_flowDiagram.jpg* was created using Google Drawings. This image is used in the report. 
- *URL_In_Context* is an edited screenshot from a NeuroImage article, where I added the colored lines to show where the URL is and where the context starts and ends. This image is used in the report. 
- *LabelingGuide.pdf* is the file the annotators received to label a subset of sentences extracted from the NeuroImage articles as a part of generating a labeled dataset to fine-tune SciBERT. This file is also included as an appendix in the report. 
- *URLs_validated_comments.xlsx* also appears in the Data folder as a CSV file. It contains all of the data URLs initially not reachable by the code. It was manually edited based on whether I could reach the URLs using a Firefox browser.
