Results:

This folder will contain the output of the different scripts

    extracted_csv will store raw csv produced by references extraction script

    processed_csv will store csv produced with the processed data of the reference extraction (e.g the csv of the combination of sources will be here)

    classification will store output of script used to classify the task of a paper Folder in which csv from API extraction will be stored

    other will store output that doesn't fit into other categories
